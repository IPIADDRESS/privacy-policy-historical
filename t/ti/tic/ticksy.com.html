				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

				<div class="entry-content">
					<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other details to help you with your experience.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">When do we collect information?</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form or enter information on our site.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">How do we use your information?</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">To personalize user’s experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
<li class="p2">To improve our website in order to better serve you.</li>
<li class="p2">To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</li>
<li class="p2">To quickly process your transactions.</li>
<li class="p2">To send periodic emails regarding your order or other products and services.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">How do we protect visitor information?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">We use regular Malware Scanning.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Do we use ‘cookies’?</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">We use cookies to u</span>nderstand and save user’s preferences for future visits.</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">If users disable cookies in their browser:</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled. It will turn off some of the features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.&nbsp;However, you can still use the website without any issues.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Third Party Disclosure</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Third party links</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">California Online Privacy Protection Act</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Users can visit our site anonymously</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">On our Privacy Policy Page</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Users are able to change their personal information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">By emailing us</span></li>
<li class="p2">By logging in to their account</li>
<li class="p2">By chatting with us or sending us a ticket</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">How does our site handle do not track signals?</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We do not specifically market to children under 13.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Fair Information Practices</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">We will notify the users via email and in-site notification w</span>ithin 1 business day</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">CAN SPAM Act</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">We collect your email address in order to:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</span></h4>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Contacting Us</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us using the information below.</span></p>
