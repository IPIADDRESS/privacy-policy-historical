Please take a moment to  read the following to learn more about our information practices, including  what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what  purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your  personal information. Your privacy is a priority at TicektDADA, and we go to  great lengths to protect it.<br>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <strong>Why we collect your personal information</strong><br>
                                              Because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us  to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on  categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information  helps us keep you posted on the latest product and service announcements,  updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.<br>
  <br>
                                              If you do not want TicektDADA to communicate to you the TicektDADA news,  updates and the latest information on products and services you may do so by  editing your profile from "My Account" section and update your  personal contact information and preferences accordingly on provision.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What information we collect</strong><br>
                                              There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us  give you better service. For example, when registering at TicektDADA, when  you're discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate, when  downloading an item detail, participating in an online survey,  registering/adding/selling/buying a product or service. At such times, we may  collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your  credit card information and information about the TicektDADA products you own  such as date of purchase etc; and information relating to a support or service  issue. We collect information for market research purposes such as your  occupation and where you use your computer to gain a better understanding of our  customers and thus provide more valuable service. We also collect information  regarding customer activities on our website, server, agent locations and on  related websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful  information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and  Internet services are of most interest to them.<br>
  <br>
                                              The TicektDADA website, as well as TicektDADA services allows you to create an TicektDADA  ID based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time  and allows for easier use of our web services. Here's how it works: You create  a personal profile providing your name, phone number, email address, and in  some cases your mailing address or a credit card number and choose a password  and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The  system saves your information and assigns you a personal TicektDADA ID in many  cases simply your phone number, because it's unique and easy to remember. The  next time you wish to transact thru the Site or trade a new product or service,  all you need to do is enter your TicektDADA ID and password; the system looks  up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the  information associated with your TicektDADA ID it will be available for all  your transactions with TicektDADA globally.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>When we disclose your information</strong><br>
                                              TicektDADA takes your privacy very seriously. Be assured that TicektDADA does  not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers. To help us  provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with other  Users of the Site, affiliates, agents and legal entities within the TicektDADA  group globally who will safeguard it in accordance with TicektDADA’s privacy  policy. There are also times when it may be advantageous for TicektDADA to make  certain personal information about you available to companies that TicektDADA  has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for TicektDADA to  provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us  process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products  to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your  interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or  satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal  information in accordance with TicektDADA’s policies.
