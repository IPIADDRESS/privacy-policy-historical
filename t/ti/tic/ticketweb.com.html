                        Inc., a Delaware corporation. TicketWeb is part of a family 
                        of companies that are ultimately owned by the same company. 
                        Many companies in this family operate under the brand 
                        "Ticketmaster". When we say "Ticketmaster Family Companies" 
                        in this privacy policy, we mean these Ticketmaster-branded 
                        companies. Any information that you provide to TicketWeb 
                        may be shared by TicketWeb with the Ticketmaster Family 
                        Companies, who may share it with each other and use it 
                        to operate the business of TicketWeb and the Ticketmaster 
                        Family Companies. Additionally, the Ticketmaster Family 
                        Companies may use that information to contact you to the 
                        same extent that TicketWeb may contact you under this 
                        privacy policy. However, the Ticketmaster Family Companies 
                        will all be subject to the terms of this privacy policy 
                        in how they use and disclose that information. The Ticketmaster 
                        Family Companies do not include "Other Corporate Affiliates" 
                        (i.e., those other companies that are ultimately owned 
                        by the same company as the one that ultimately owns TicketWeb 
                        but that do not operate under the "Ticketmaster" brand-examples

In some cases we may use service providers to help us perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, processing or fulfilling your orders, or performing customer service, business analyses or quality control, and consequently we may share your contact information with these service providers.  In such cases, we often require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information.  We may also provide your contact information to your credit card issuer or to credit card processors for their purposes.  When you make a purchase through the Site, or register with the Site, you will provide us with an email address where we, or these service providers, may contact you for the purposes described in this paragraph.<br>

We will use and disclose that email address for customer service and those other purposes described in this privacy policy.  You will also be given the opportunity to tell us whether you want us to send you promotional emails at that email address.  "Promotional emails" are emails that are sent solely for promotional purposes.  For your convenience, we will have pre-checked a box indicating that you do want to receive these emails.  If you do not want us to send promotional emails to an email address simply uncheck the box when you provide that email address, or visit My Account to unsubscribe.  Because many consumers like to receive some, but not all, types of promotional emails, the Site may provide you with the ability to determine the types of emails that you want to receive.  Please note that if you ask not to receive promotional emails from TicketWeb, you may still receive non-promotional emails from TicketWeb, and you may still receive emails from certain others (including, but not limited to, Event Providers (defined below)); please read the rest of this privacy policy to learn how others may contact you.<br><br></font>                  
						   </li><li><font class="verdana10nb" color="black" face="verdana,geneva,arial,helvetica" size="1"><b>Providing Event Providers with Contact Information.</b>  TicketWeb sells tickets on behalf of others; it does not produce or otherwise bring you events.  Venues, promoters, bands, teams, leagues and others ("Event Providers") produce and bring you events.  When you use TicketWeb to order tickets (or to register while attempting to order Tickets), instead of providing your information directly to Event Providers, you provide your contact information to TicketWeb who may then pass that information on to the Event Providers on your behalf-in fact, when you purchase tickets or register to purchase tickets from TicketWeb, you consent for us to provide your email address and other information to the Event Providers.  This will allow Event Providers to contact you using the email address or other contact information you provided.  Because Event Providers are not part of TicketWeb or the Ticketmaster Family Companies, Event Providers are not subject to this privacy policy and may still use your contact information to communicate with you by sending emails or through other means, and may share your contact information with others. If you want to learn about a particular Event Provider's privacy policies, or you do not want to receive communications from a particular Event Provider, or you have other questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like an Event Provider to respond, then you must contact that Event Provider directly.  Also, you may contact an Event Provider directly to learn whether you may purchase tickets to the Event Provider's event anonymously (i.e., without having that Event Provider receive your contact information) by purchasing tickets directly through the Event Provider's box office using cash instead of purchasing through TicketWeb.<br><br></font>

Typically, these goods, services, contests, sweepstakes or other offers or programs ("Special Offers") for which you make purchases, orders or reservations, or for which you participate in or register, are provided by third parties ("Merchants").  Consequently, if you elect to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer, TicketWeb may provide that Merchant with your contact information-in fact, when you elect to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer you consent for us to provide your email address and other information to that Merchant.    Because Merchants are not part of TicketWeb or the Ticketmaster Family Companies, Merchants are not subject to this privacy policy and may use your contact information to communicate with you by sending emails or through other means, and may share your contact information with others.  If you want to learn about a particular Merchant's privacy policies, or you do not want to receive communications from a particular Merchant, or you have other questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like a Merchant to respond, then you must contact that Merchant directly.<br><br></font>

						Please note that changing information through your My Account profile, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from TicketWeb and third parties (other than Event Providers or others for whom you cannot use the Site to cause an opt-out to be effective as stated above) will only change the data reflected in My Account for purposes of transacting future business on the Site and for managing future communications from TicketWeb.
