<font class="verdana10nb" color="black" face="verdana,geneva,arial,helvetica" size="1">We use your personal information to help us efficiently perform transactions on the Site, to deliver the services you have requested, to contact you when necessary in connection with events or exhibitions for which you purchased tickets on the Site (including event confirmations, changes and cancellations), and to send you information, offers and other promotional materials from TicketWeb and selected third parties. We carefully select the information we send to you and attempt to send you offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. The Site provides you with the option of declining to receive offers from TicketWeb by "opting-out" of receiving this type of communication.  To process transactions on the Site, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, order fulfillment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment.  We require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose.<br><br>  

By purchasing a ticket to a concert, game, exhibition or other event (each, an "Event") on the Site, you consent (i.e., you opt-in) to us sharing your personal information with the venues, clubs, promoters, artists, teams, leagues, museums and other third parties associated with that Event ("Event Partners"). We cannot offer you a separate opportunity to opt-out, or not to consent, to our sharing of your personal information with them.  Event Partners may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies, and may consequently use your personal information to contact you and may share your personal information with others. You will need to contact those Event Partners who contact you to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.<br><br>     

By purchasing, or making reservations for, products or services (such as magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or cruises), electing to receive communications (such as emails) or electing to participate in, or register for, contests, sweepstakes, or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties.  Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies, and may consequently use your personal information to contact you and may share your personal information with others.  You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.  Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose all such information submitted by you for such third party offers in the same manner in which we use and disclose all other information submitted by you for offers we sponsor.<br><br> 

We may select third parties with whom we will share your personal information so that they can communicate directly with you about their products and services. In order to decline having your personal information that we collected on the Site shared with these selected third parties, you must, in the My Account section of the Site, uncheck both the box for receiving Ticket Alert and the box for receiving Special Offers.  We attempt to carefully select these third parties and the specific offers they intend to communicate to you so that you will receive valuable offers.<br><br>  

Your personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets of TicketWeb. We may also disclose specific information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of TicketWeb or other visitors to the Site or users of services or products provided by TicketWeb.  We may also disclose your personal information to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control.  However, all of these parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive your personal information from us will comply with the terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such personal information.<br><br>

Except as may otherwise be described in this policy, we have no control over the personal information practices of Event Partners and other third parties.  As described above, by purchasing tickets on the Site, purchasing other products or services from third parties, electing to receive communications from or to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs associated with, or sponsored by, third parties, filling out a registration form on the Site or otherwise opting to allow us to share your information with third parties as permitted in this policy, you authorize us to share your personal information with Event Partners and these other third parties, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions.  These Event Partners and these other third parties may use your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with them and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control.  You will need to contact them directly in order to instruct them regarding your preferences for how they use your personal information.

Also, depending on the circumstances of our arrangements, we may share your financial information with applicable Event Partners, primarily for facilitating "will call" ticket pick up and dispute resolution and customer service at the Event location on the date of the Event.  By purchasing, or making reservations for, products or services of third parties (such as magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or cruises) offered on the Site, or by participating in programs offered on the Site that are administered by third parties and that require you to submit financial information in order to use them, you also consent to our providing your financial information to those third parties.

When you receive a confirmation email from us confirming your registration or purchase, you will be provided with a link to change these preferences.

After we collect personal information that you submit in connection with purchasing or reserving products or services, electing to receive communications or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, or registering with the Site, we may use such information to send you marketing emails.

We also give you the opportunity to opt-out and modify information you have provided to us at anytime by clicking on the My Account link and selecting those portions of your account you would like to update.<br><br>

Please note that changing or deleting your information through your My Account profile, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from TicketWeb and third parties (other than Event Partners) will only change or delete the data in our My Account database for purposes of transacting future business on the Site and for managing future communications from TicketWeb and third parties.
