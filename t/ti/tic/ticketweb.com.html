                  tickets to several events. Most Web browsers automatically accept

                  TicketWeb does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information 
                  to others. We are privacy fanatics! As such, unlike other ticketing 
                  companies, TicketWeb does not ask users to sign in, create a 
                  screen name or create a password to buy tickets. TicketWeb does 
                  not collect e-mail addresses and does not use user information 
                  for any purpose other than selling, mailing and checking on 
                  ticket orders. TicketWeb may provide aggregate statistics about 
                  our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information 
                  to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will 
                  include no personally identifying information. TicketWeb has 
                  several clients who have merchant accounts. This means that 
                  they process their own credit card orders. On the final order 
                  page, the button will either say, "I agree to pay TicketWeb," 
                  or "I agree to pay (venue's name)." If a venue's name is on 
                  the button and not TicketWeb, that venue uses its own merchant 
                  account to process orders and gathers your personal information. 
                  TicketWeb cannot control what they do with that information, 
                  and users should check the privacy policy for those venues.
