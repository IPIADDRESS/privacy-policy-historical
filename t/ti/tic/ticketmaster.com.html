Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on February 23, 2004.  Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.

                      Information.</strong>  Ticketmaster sells tickets on behalf of others; it does not produce or otherwise bring you events.  Venues, promoters, bands, teams, leagues and others ("Event Providers") produce and bring you events.  When you use Ticketmaster to order tickets (or to register while attempting to order Tickets), instead of providing your information directly to Event Providers, you provide your contact information to Ticketmaster who may then pass that information on to the Event Providers on your behalf-in fact, when you purchase or register to purchase tickets from Ticketmaster you affirmatively and expressly consent for us to provide your email address and other information to the Event Providers that bring you the event.  This will allow Event Providers to contact you using the email address or other contact information you provided.  If, before we provide your contact information to an Event Provider, you request not to receive promotional emails from Ticketmaster, then we will pass that request on to the Event Provider (unless you register with the Site using a Canadian postal code, as further described in "Special Provisions Regarding Canadian Call Centres and Customers" below).  Nonetheless, because Event Providers are not part of Ticketmaster, Event Providers are not subject to this privacy policy and may still use your contact information to communicate with you by sending emails or through other means, and may share your contact information with others. If you want to learn about a particular Event Provider's privacy policies, or you do not want to receive communications from a particular Event Provider, or you have other questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like an Event Provider to respond, then you must contact that Event Provider directly.  Also, you may contact an Event Provider directly to learn whether you may purchase tickets to the Event Provider's event anonymously (i.e., without having that Event Provider receive your contact information) by purchasing tickets directly through the Event Provider's box office using cash instead of purchasing through Ticketmaster.  Alternatively, you may purchase tickets at a Ticketmaster in-store outlet and not provide any contact information.</td>
