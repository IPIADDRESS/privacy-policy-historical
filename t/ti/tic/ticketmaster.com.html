We carefully select the information we send to you and attempt to send you offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. The Site provides you with the option of declining to receive offers from Ticketmaster by "opting-out" of receiving this type of communication.  To process transactions on the Site, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, order fulfillment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment, as well as to your credit card issuer for their purposes.  We require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose. 
		<p>
			By purchasing a ticket, or completing a registration form so that you are able to access a purchase page for a ticket, to a concert, game or other event on the Site, you consent (i.e., you opt-in) to us sharing your personal information with the venues, promoters, artists, teams, leagues and other third parties associated with that concert, game or other event ("Event Partners"). We cannot offer you  a separate opportunity to opt-out, or not to consent, to our sharing of your personal information with them.  Event Partners may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies, and may consequently use your personal information to contact you and may share your personal information with others. You will need to contact those Event Partners who contact you to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.	
		</p>
		<p>
			By purchasing, or making reservations for, products or services (such as magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or cruises), electing to receive communications (such as emails) or electing to participate in, or register for, contests, sweepstakes, or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties.  Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies, and may consequently use your personal information to contact you and may share your personal information with others.  You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.  Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose all such information submitted by you for such third party offers in the same manner in which we use and disclose all other information submitted by you for offers we sponsor.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may select third parties with whom we will share your personal information so that they can communicate directly with you about their products and services. In order to decline having your personal information that we collected on the Site shared with these selected third parties, you must, in the My Account section of the Site, uncheck both the box for receiving Special Ticket Offers and the box for receiving Ticket Related Merchandise and Services.  We attempt to carefully select these third parties and the specific offers they intend to communicate to you so that you will receive valuable offers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy, of Ticketmaster. We may also disclose specific information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of Ticketmaster or other visitors to the Site or users of services or products provided by Ticketmaster.  We may also disclose your personal information to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control.

		When you register to create an account with the Site or complete a purchase transaction on the Site, we will either give you the opportunity to set certain email preferences at the place where you register or make the purchase, or we will automatically set certain email preferences for you.  When you receive a confirmation email from us confirming your registration or purchase, you will be provided with a link to change these preferences.  The link will take you to a place where you can change registration information, including your email preferences.  After we collect personal information that you submit in connection with purchasing or reserving products or services, electing to receive communications or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, or registering with the Site, we may use such information to send you marketing emails.  However, if we do so, we will provide a link that you can click on to opt-out of receiving subsequent marketing emails sent by us generated from the same such information. We also give you the opportunity to opt-out and modify information you have provided to us at anytime by clicking on the My Account link, navigating to your "My Account" account and selecting those portions of your account you would like to update.

		Please note that changing or deleting your information through your My Account Profile, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from Ticketmaster and third parties (other than Event Partners) will only change or delete the data in our My Account database for purposes of transacting future business on the Site and for managing future communications from Ticketmaster and third parties.  These changes and deletions will not change or delete:

		A) Information already collected as part of a particular ticket purchase in our transactions database which may be shared with our Event Partners regardless of your email preferences; or
