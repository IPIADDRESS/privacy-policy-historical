<span class="presstext"><b>Tickle's Privacy Principles</b>

<ul>
<li>Your privacy is protected at Tickle.
</li><li>You control your personal information.
</li><li>You can end your membership at any time.
</li><li>We will never disclose your personal information to any third party unless you expressly tell us to.
</li></ul>

<p>Tickle is an online media company that brings you fun, insightful, and personalized information in our emails and on our website.
</p><p>We want to give you information that you care about and that is relevant to you. So, we enter into a voluntary relationship with you where we listen to who you are, and what you want. Then we go out and find it and bring it back to you in the most personalized services possible. It's that simple, and it's that cool — our emails and services are all about you and the data you disclose to us makes it possible to deliver what you truly want.<br><br>

<p><a name="types"></a><b>What types of information does Tickle collect?</b><br>
Many of the ways in which you interact with our site allow us to learn more
about you. We collect both personal and public information when you become a
member of Tickle. </p>

<p>Personal information includes your email address and self-created
password. This information is considered personally identifiable and will not
be displayed on our site. Special provisions apply to the Open Group Tests. See
the "<a href="#ogt">Tell me about the
Open Group Tests</a>" section below. </p>

<p>Public information is information that helps us to personalize your Tickle
experience. Public information may include, but is not limited to,
member-submitted information such as your username, first name, last name,
gender, age, height, lifestyle information, geographic location, and photo.
Much of this information is optional, and meant to be seen by members to
support the function of the site as a social networking service.</p>

<p>Special provisions apply to the social networking service. See the "<a href="#control">How do I control or change
my information?</a>" section below.</p>

<p>We collect and store certain technical and other information about the
online activities of our users — whether or not they are registered — on an
aggregated (or collective) basis. This includes your IP address, browser type,
and operating system. Tickle does not use this information to identify you or to
match it with your testing activities. We do, however, track the
number of people who view each page, and other site usage data, in order to
learn which features are the most popular and thereby improve our service. We
also record statistical information collected on our site to better understand
our audience. This information is recorded as anonymous group statistical
information and is not connected to any personal information unless you
register as an Tickle member. </p>

<p>When you become a member of Tickle, your name and email address will be
linked to your testing information. If you prefer to not link the testing
information to your personal information, you may delete the test in your <a href="/account/tests/">My Tests</a> section. As a
registered member, you can choose to receive our email newsletter. Tickle may
use URL tracking in the emails sent to you. When you open such email messages,
our system may record the following data: the time you viewed the email and the
URLs that you clicked on from that email. Tickle will also record if your email
program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email. URL tracking may use
cookies. </p>

<p>Tickle uses this information to assess or modify our content in these emails.
Tickle may use this information in an aggregated, statistical form to describe
our audience and services on our site to third parties (i.e., anyone or any
entity who is not an employee, agent, or subsidiary of Tickle). If you send an
email or submit any information to our customer support staff, we will retain
your email or other information for the time necessary to respond to you.
Special provisions apply to the Open Group Tests. See the "<a href="#ogt">Tell me about
the Open Group Tests</a>" section below. Tickle also uses cookies as described
in more detail below. </p>

<p>From time-to-time we will request information from members via surveys.
Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a
choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may
include contact information such as name and demographic information (such as
zip code and age). </p>

<p>We collect credit card information only from those who choose to participate
in our pay services and we maintain a record of all transactions. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="disclose"></a><b>How does Tickle use or disclose my information?</b><br>
Tickle never discloses your personal information to any third party unless you
have given us your express permission. Tickle uses the public information you
voluntarily give us to better understand who you are and provide you with
customized services. </p>

<p>Tickle may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our audience,
services, and to develop partnerships with third parties (i.e., anyone or any
entity who is not an employee, agent, or subsidiary of Tickle). For example, if
30% of our members were interested in home and gardening, we would share that
statistic with a home and gardening service provider in order to offer that
service to our members. We would not disclose our members' individual data.
Rest assured, we do not disclose your personal information. </p>

<p>Tickle uses public information such as your username, first name, last name,
gender, age, height, preference/lifestyle information and geographic location
for searching and matching purposes. </p>

<p>Tickle uses your email address to verify membership and when forwarding
anonymous emails to you to from other members.</p>

<p>Your email address and full name are used when a member invites another
person via email to join Tickle's social networking
service, or when a member requests to add another member to their friends network.</p>

<p>Except when inviting or adding people, a member's email address is not
shared or displayed to others in a member's network.</p>

<p>Members within the same network communicate with each other through the
social networking service, without disclosing email addresses.</p>

<p>Tickle will use your email address to automatically save the full test
results of any test you take on our site in your <a href="/account/tests/">My Tests</a> section. In such
instances, when your personal information is directly connected to your
statistical information, we do not disclose this information to third parties
except as provided in this Privacy Policy or with your permission.</p>

<p>We may also use your email address to send you news regarding our site, but
you may choose not to receive email of this type by going to <a href="/account/subscriptions/">My Subscriptions</a>. </p>

<p>Your mail address may also be used in private correspondence with you for
customer service issues. Financial information that is collected is used to
bill you for products and services. All other private information submitted by
you is confidential and will not be disclosed except as required by law or to
protect members of Tickle. All private information can be updated or deleted by
you at any time. </p>

<p>Tickle may develop special sites in cooperation with other companies. If you
register at these "co-branded" sites, we share your registration
information (such as name and email address) with that company. If you take a
test on a co-branded site, however, we only provide the other company with
anonymous, aggregated testing information. Unless explicitly stated, Tickle will
not share your testing information with those companies in a personally identifiable
format. Tickle is not responsible for and does not control the data collection
practices of those other companies. To learn more about their separate privacy
policies, contact the company directly. Special provisions apply to the Open
Group Tests. See the "<a href="#ogt">Tell
me about the Open Group Tests</a>" section below. </p>

<p>Our business is about building a long-term relationship with you. To build
that trust, we know that as you spend time on our site and with our email
newsletters, your personal information must remain within your control.
Therefore, unless you give us your express permission, except if we believe in
good faith that the law requires it, that disclosure is necessary to respond to
a subpoena, warrant, or court order, or to protect the rights of Tickle or
others, we will not share your personal information with unauthorized third
parties. We consider your personal information to be exactly that-yours. And we
will do our best to protect it! </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="control"></a><b>How do I control or change my information?</b><br>
Once you become a member of Tickle, your personal information is stored in the <a href="/account/profile/">My Profile</a> section of the
site. You may access or change your information at any time. </p>
<p>If you have created a profile on our social networking service, you can make
edits to the public information, which may be displayed there, by going to the <a href="http://connect.tickle.com/profile/index.html">My
Networking Profile</a> section of the site.</p>

<p>In addition, our social networking service allows you to control which
members have the ability to contact you, and which members have the ability to
view specific information in your profile. You can utilize these controls at
any time by going to your <a href="http://connect.tickle.com/profile/index.html">Access Settings</a>.</p>

<p>Your test answers and results will be stored with your personal information
and can be viewed in the <a href="/account/tests/">My Tests</a>
section of our site. You may separate your test answers from your personal
information at any time by deleting your tests from <a href="/account/tests/">My Tests</a>. Special provisions
apply to the Open Group Tests. See the "<a href="#ogt">Tell me about the Open
Group Tests</a>" section below. </p>

<p>As part of your membership, Tickle will send you product and service
offerings we think you'll be interested in via email. If you do not want to
participate in the programs we offer to you, simply go to <a href="/account/subscriptions/">My Subscriptions</a> and
tell us. If you do not want to receive any emails from us, you should delete
your Tickle membership in the <a href="/account/profile/">My

<p><a name="ogt"></a><b>Tell me about the Open Group Tests</b><br>
To take our Open Group Tests ("OGTs"), you need to sign up as an Tickle member, which
requires that you provide certain personal information, as described above.
Once you've completed an OGT, some of your information, including your OGT
results, first name, and email address are listed on a comparative scorecard
alongside the results of your invited friends and family who have also taken
the test. </p>

<p>Through our comparative scorecard, Tickle allows you to create a list of your
friends and to compare your OGT results with theirs. It works like this: you
tell us whom to invite; our technology invites them on your behalf to
participate in the OGT. Once your friend takes the test, you will receive an
email notice that his or her results are in. On a "results" page,
which every invited participant can access and view, you can see their OGT
results, first name, email address and how you match up in certain categories
(OGT Information). You will also see whom they have listed as friends, along
with their friends' OGT Information. </p>

<p>Each participant can view their "personal invitation list" and who
has yet to participate. The "personal invitation list" can only be
seen by the inviter. Additionally, other Tickle members can see and compare
themselves with your OGT Information by entering your email address or the
email address of one of your listed friends. </p>

<p>Your results are included in the <a href="/account/tests/">My Tests</a> section of our site and
can be removed at any time. </p>

<p><a name="secure"></a><b>How does Tickle keep my information secure?</b><br>
Every Tickle employee understands that the privacy of our members is a top
priority. Access to members' personal information is strictly limited to our
Tickle Security Team, comprising a small number of engineers and customer
relationship employees. A customer relationship employee will handle your
personal information only to respond to your communication or to better
understand our audience to help with our editorial direction. The engineers on
our Security Team handle personal information when they maintain our site and
email newsletters. Rest assured that the members of our Security Team are
subject to stringent confidentiality requirements. Any member information
disseminated outside of the Tickle Security Team is anonymous and aggregated. </p>

<p>Your Tickle profile is password-protected so that you are the only member who
has access to this information. We recommend that you do not divulge your
password to anyone. To ensure that you've logged out of your account, please
remember to close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This
is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and
correspondence, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are
using a computer in a public place, such as a library or Internet cafe. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to
be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal
information, Tickle cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your
own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort, including
the use of firewalls, to ensure the security of your information on our
systems. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p><a name="cookies"></a><b>What are cookies and how does Tickle use them?</b><br>
Like many sites on the Web, Tickle uses cookies to store and track information
about you when you're on our site so that we can better provide personalized
services that better match your needs and interests. We also use cookies to
assess which features on the site are popular among our users. </p>

<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web
server and stored on your computer's hard drive, then sent back to the server
by your browser each time you access certain sections of the site. Cookies
allow you to store your email address without having to re-enter it. </p>

<p>Note that the advertising networks serving ads on Tickle may also user their
own cookies. Tickle does not control these cookies or the data collection
practices of these companies. For more information about their separate privacy
policies, you should contact the third-party advertising network directly. For
more information on the privacy policies of our advertisers, see below. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="ads"></a><b>What privacy policies cover the ads on your site?</b><br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site. These
companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs
or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that
these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely
anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your
choices, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="ecom"></a><b>What privacy policies cover transactions with e-commerce partners on your
site?</b><br>
When you provide personal financial and other personally identifiable
information to VeriSign, Tickle's e-commerce partner, this transaction will occur on VeriSign's
site, not Tickle. As such, the financial and personally identifiable information
you provide is collected by and controlled by the Privacy Policy of VeriSign. Please <a href="http://www.verisign.com/repository/Privacy_FAQ/index.html" target="_blank">click
here</a> to read their Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="changes"></a><b>Changes to the Tickle Privacy Policy</b><br>
This policy may change from time to time. If we make any material changes to
the policy in the future with regard to how we use your information, we will
notify you on our homepage and in our email newsletters. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="merge"></a><b>What happens to my information if Tickle is sold to or merges with another
company?</b><br>
While Tickle will endeavor to require the successor company to maintain this
privacy policy, we cannot guarantee that our policy will remain unchanged if
Tickle is sold or merges with another company. We will use our best efforts to
notify you by email if such a merger or acquisition occurs. As always, in the
event of a merger or acquisition, you will be able to edit or delete your profile
at Tickle. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="resident"></a><b>What if I'm a resident outside of the U.S.?</b><br>
Like almost every Web site, Tickle may be accessed by an international audience.
By visiting our Web site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree
that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in
this policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside
your resident jurisdiction, which may have less stringent privacy practices
than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of
such data. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><a name="whatelse"></a><b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b><br>
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your
passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible
whenever you're online. The few Tickle employees who have access to personal
data are trained to comply with the above privacy policy and made aware of any
updates or modifications. </p>
