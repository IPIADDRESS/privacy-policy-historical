                    <li>
                        We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
                    <li>
                        We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
                    <li>

                <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>

                <p>Tictail AB (“<strong>Tictail</strong>”) operates several websites including Tictail.com and stores created by Tictail users. It is Tictail’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

            <div class="span8">
                <p>Like most website operators, Tictail collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tictail’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tictail’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Tictail may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p> Tictail also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for visitors to our websites. Tictail only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

            <div class="span8">
                <p>Certain visitors to Tictail’s websites choose to interact with Tictail in ways that require Tictail to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Tictail gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a store at Tictail.com to provide a store name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Tictail stores are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Tictail collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Tictail. Tictail does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

                <p> Tictail may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Tictail may monitor the most popular stores or use spam screening services to help identify spam. Tictail may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Tictail does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

            <div class="span8">
                <p> Tictail discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Tictail’s behalf or to provide services available at Tictail’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Tictail’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tictail will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tictail discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Tictail believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tictail, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Tictail and have supplied your email address, Tictail may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Tictail and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Tictail takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

                <p> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Tictail uses cookies to help Tictail identify and track visitors, their usage of Tictail websites, and their website access preferences. Tictail visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Tictail’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Tictail’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
