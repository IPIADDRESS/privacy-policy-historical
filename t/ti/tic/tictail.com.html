<h2 id="4-right-to-access-personal-data">4. Right to Access Personal Data</h2>

<ul>
<li>the purposes of the processing; </li>

<li>the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the Personal Data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries, i.e. a country outside of the EU/EEA; </li>
<li>where possible, the envisaged period for which the Personal Data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; </li>
<li>the existence of the right to request from Tictail rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing of Personal Data concerning you or to object to such processing; </li>

<br><h2 id="5-right-to-rectification-etc-">5. Right to Rectification etc.</h2>

<h3 id="the-right-to-be-forgotten">The right to be forgotten</h3>
<p>You have the right to obtain from Tictail the erasure of Personal Data concerning you without undue delay and Tictail has the obligation to erase Personal Data without undue delay inter alia when the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed or you have withdrawn consent on which the processing is based. </p>
<h3 id="restriction-of-processing">Restriction of processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to obtain from Tictail restriction of processing if you have a particular reason for wanting the restriction.

<h3 id="data-portability">Data portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to receive the Personal Data concerning you, which you have provided to Tictail, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another data controller without hindrance from Tictail where the processing is based on consent or on a contract or the processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
<h3 id="profiling">Profiling</h3>

<h2 id="6-data-processing-agreements">6. Data Processing Agreements</h2>
<p>Tictail cooperates with other companies which process Personal Data on behalf of Tictail. Tictail uses only data processors that provide sufficient guarantees that they implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR and ensure the protection of the rights of all data subjects concerned.</p>
