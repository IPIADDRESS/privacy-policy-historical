When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.&nbsp; In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.<br><strong><br><br>Personal Information You Provide to Us: <br></strong><br>We receive and store any information you enter on the Website, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include, without limitation, your name, email address, photograph, physical descriptions and personal interests. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information. <br><strong><br><br>Personal Information Collected Automatically: <br></strong><br>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or obtain services from us. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Company cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Website. <br>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site.

We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Website’s most attractive features without cookies enabled. <br><br>Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies.
