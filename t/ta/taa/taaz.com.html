					Photometria, Inc. (the "Company") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Photometria, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the Web site www.taaz.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.<br>
					<br>
					If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact tou@taaz.com. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=">TRUSTe</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.<br>
					<br>
					Photometria, Inc. complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. By using the Website, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.<br>
					<br>
					You post any Content (as that term is defined in the Company's <a href="http://www.taaz.com/terms_of_use.html">Terms of Use</a>) on the Website at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Content.<br>
					<br>
					Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information accessible on the Website is a violation of the Company's Terms of Use and should be reported to tou@taaz.com.<br>
					<br>
					What Other Personal Information Does Company Display or Collect?<br>
					<br>
					This Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you are accessing the Website, www.taaz.com, and when you use our services. When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with Company and other users through the Website. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.<br>
					<br>
					Personal Information You Provide to Us:<br>
					<br>
					We receive and store any information you enter on the Website. The types of Personal Information collected may include, without limitation, your name, email address, photograph, physical descriptions and personal interests. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information.<br>
					<br>
					If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our Website, add a friend to your profile, or share a makeover with a friend we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the Website. Company stores this information to send this invitation, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at tou@taaz.comto request that we remove this information from our database.<br>
					<br>
					From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).<br>
					<br>
					We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), and to send participants an email newsletter.<br>
					<br>
					We may use a third party service provider to conduct these contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.<br>
					<br>
					Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Website or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to Company or on the Website. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at tou@taaz.com .<br>
					<br>
					Personal Information Collected Automatically:<br>
					<br>
					We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or obtain services from us. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Company cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Website. Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.<br>
					<br>
					We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site. We have no access or control over these third party cookies. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.<br>
					<br>
					Email Communications:<br>
					<br>
					We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company by using clear gifs in our HTML-based emails. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions in the emails.<br>
					<br>
					What About Cookies?<br>
					<br>
					Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.<br>
					<br>
					Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Website's most attractive features without cookies enabled.<br>
					<br>
					Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
					<br>
					Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)<br>
					<br>
					Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.<br>
