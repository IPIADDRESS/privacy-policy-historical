<p>We comply with United States privacy laws and regulations.  We do not represent that the Sites are governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of other nations, or that the Sites or any portion of the Sites are appropriate or available for use in any particular location.  If you choose to access the Sites, you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.  Visitors to the Sites from outside the United States acknowledge and agree, by using the Sites, that the Sites are subject to United States laws and regulations, and waive any claims against us that may arise under their own national laws.</p>

<p id="policy-updated-date" style="font-style: italic;">Last Updated: October 28, 2013</p>
<p>This Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Sites and not to any other website that you may be able to access from any of the Sites which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.  We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and such revisions will become effective upon the earlier of (i) posting of the revisions to the Sites, or (ii) distribution by electronic mail.

<p>This Policy applies solely to our online information gathering and disclosure practices in connection with the Sites, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline.
This Policy answers the following questions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">
<li>What is our policy on children under 13 years of age?</li>
<li>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</li> 
<li>Will we share your personally-identifiable information with third parties?</li>

</ul>
<h2>What is our policy on children under the age of 13?</h2>
<p>The Sites are not for children under 13 years of age, but there are some areas of the Sites that may be attractive to children under 13.  We do not condition participation by a child of any age in any activity or any of the services available on or through the Sites on the disclosure of more personally-identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.  We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from users of the Sites who are under 13 years of age.  No personally-identifiable information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Sites by visitors under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>If we receive an e-mail message from a child who discloses, or is otherwise known to us, to be under 13 years of age, we may, without the consent of the child's parent or guardian:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Respond to a one-time request from the child;</li>
<li>Provide notice of the child's communication to the child's parent or guardian;</li>
<li>Use this information as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the child on the Sites; or</li>
<li>Send our electronic periodical publications and materials, with the notification to the child's parent or guardian of the option to discontinue any future delivery of the electronic periodical publications and materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who might have provided personally-identifiable information to us may request a description of the personally-identifiable information that has been collected from or about that child, and either limit or restrict any further maintenance or use of such information from that child and/or direct us to delete it.  Also, a parent may decline to allow any future collection of personally-identifiable information from that child.  Such requests can be made by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@taylorswift.com">privacy@taylorswift.com</a>. We will take reasonable measures to verify that the requesting party is, in fact, the parent or guardian of the child in question before providing a child's personally-identifiable information to such person.</p>
<p>We will not knowingly use or disclose any personally-identifiable information of a child under 13 years of age for any purpose except as described above.</p>  

<h2>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</h2>

<h3>The types of information we collect and how we collect it</h3>
<p>By accessing or using the Sites, you may provide us two types of information: (1) personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information; and (2) non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of the technology called "cookies," "web beacons" and/or "web logs.  To access or use certain aspects of the Services offered on the Sites, you might be asked to submit personally-identifiable information. You are not required to submit personally-identifiable information to access those areas of the Sites, but you will not be able to access or use certain aspects of the available Services if you choose not to submit the requested personally-identifiable information.</p>
<p>We collect personally-identifiable information when you create an account, subscribe to our mailing list, participate in chat rooms, forums, polls, surveys, questionnaires, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions; purchase a product; contact us; or receive customer or technical support.  
To subscribe to our mailing list, you will need to provide your e-mail address, the country of your primary residence, and your date of birth.  Additional optional information may be provided at your sole discretion. You will also need to create a screen name and password to access some of the other Services.  When you are purchasing products, you will need to provide your name, address, e-mail address and phone number and, additionally, we or one of our third-party payment or fulfillment service providers will ask for your shipping and billing address and credit card, debit card or other payment information.</p>
<p>We may also collect other types of information (known as demographic information) such as your gender, hobbies and interests. This demographic information may be associated with your personally-identifiable information.</p>
<h3>How we use your personally-identifiable information</h3>
<p>The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us will allow us to personalize your experience, fulfill your product or service order, contact you about your account or your order of our products or services, alert you of new products or services, features or enhancements, notify you of changes in the Services, handle/route your customer service questions or issues, and/or inform you of contests, promotions, or special events and offers.</p> 
<p>We keep track of your interactions with us, including, but not limited to, your activity within the Services.  We may use information relating to your interactions with us to generate information about the popularity of certain Services and how users of the Sites utilize different aspects of the Services ("<b>Popularity Data</b>").  We may use this Popularity Data to design, develop and implement additional services and features of the Sites and to improve the Services.  Popularity Data may be associated with your account and we may provide a point system in which your account earns points through the amount of Popularity Data your account has achieved.  These points may be displayed with the account information that is publicly displayed to other end users of the Sites, such as when you participate in a forum in the Sites, but we do not disclose the Popularity Data itself as associated with your account.</p>
<p>We may use personally-identifiable information that you provide to us to send you messages in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Services.</p>
<h3>How we use your non-personally-identifiable information</h3>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>We use "cookies" to collect information, on an aggregate basis, about how the Sites are used. This information may include the date and time of visits to the Sites and time spent on the Sites. The use of "cookies" allows us to personalize your use of the Sites and to provide greater convenience each time that you visit.  Additionally, any advertisements that are managed by third parties appearing on the Sites use cookies.  Advertisers use cookies to collect non-personal information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. Advertisers use this information to monitor the performance of their advertisements. In some cases, we may have access to information from cookies used by these advertisers on the Sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with such advertisers.  
You may choose to disable cookies on your computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your computer (please consult instructions for your web browser). However, if you disable or block cookies, it is possible that some parts of the Services will not be accessible to you.</p>
<h4>Log Information </h4>

This information includes the time and date, your Internet Protocol address, your geographic location, (your zip code, your area code and/or time zone), your browser type and version, which Sites and/or Services you use and when and how long you use them.  We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the Sites and Services, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the Services.
Will we share your personally-identifiable information with third parties?</p>
<h3>Sharing of information</h3>
<p>We may disclose certain elements of your personally identifiable information (e.g., your name,  e-mail address, mailing address, and zip code) with our employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors, and our related and affiliated entities, including, but not limited to, 13 Management, LLC, Firefly Entertainment, Inc., Swift Merchandising, Inc., and Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., and their respective employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors, for the limited purpose of enabling them to communicate directly with you about upcoming musical performances, personal appearances, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, announcements and other special events.</p>
<p>We may use your personally-identifiable information to provide analyses of our users in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, affiliation, position, interests and other non-personally-identifiable information about customers.  
In addition, we will share the personally-identifiable information we collect from you under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Protection of rights.</span>  We will share personally-identifiable information if we have a good faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce the Terms of Use for the Sites, including any investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Services, or (iv) such action is appropriate to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our employees, users of the Services or others.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Asset transfers</span>.  If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information, including personally-identifiable information collected from you through your use of the Services, could be included in the transferred assets.  Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through e-mail and/or a prominent notice on the Sites.</li> 
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Providers</span>.  We may share your personally-identifiable information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf.  For example, we have partnered with other companies to sell products through the Services, fulfill product orders, process payments and administer our e-mail announcements.  Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process consumer surveys, fulfill prizes, or to process, analyze and/or store data.  While providing services for us, these companies may access your personally-identifiable information.  To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">On-line Sweepstakes and Contests</span>. If you choose to participate in any of our on-line promotions such as Sweepstakes and/or Contests, your personally-identifiable information collected in connection with on-line contest, sweepstakes or other promotions may be shared with the third-party sponsors of such promotions, or otherwise as set forth in the Official Rules applicable to the promotion.  You should carefully review the Official Rules of each promotion in which you choose to participate through the Sites, as they may contain additional important information about a third party's use of your personally-identifiable information.  To the extent any Official Rules conflict with this Policy, the Official Rules will govern that particular promotion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional information you should know about third parties</h3>
<p>This Policy does not cover the information practices of third-party websites linked to any of the Sites, as we do not control those third-party websites, and are not responsible for, their collection and use of your personally-identifiable information.  You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.</p>
<p>When you click on an advertisement or a logo or text for a third party displayed on the Sites that links you to a different website, this Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or third party to see how your personally-identifiable information will be handled on their website.</p>
<p>The Services may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.  When you post to a message board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information you post is made publicly available on-line and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h2>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personally-identifiable information?</h2>
<h3>Control of your information</h3>
<p>You may access, update or delete your personally-identifiable information or modify your account preferences for the Services by accessing the "My Account" area of the Services or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@taylorswift.com">privacy@taylorswift.com</a>.  Please note that when you delete your account, we may retain your account information for a reasonable period of time afterward for the purpose of internal account management and fraud prevention activities. Please also understand that, once deleted, your information may not be available on the Sites but may remain stored indefinitely in our databases.</p>

Please note that your requested changes will not be effective until we implement such changes.  Please also note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions.</p>
<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>If you are a resident of a country outside of the European Economic Area, you also agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Policy, you will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly with either GROUND CTRL, LLC d/b/a Ground(ctrl) or Taylor Nation, LLC. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, the parties shall join in mediation services in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee, with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute.  Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorney's fees or costs, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.</p>
<h3>Dispute resolution for residents of the European Economic Area</h3>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>"), in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Policy, you may report your claim to the Data Protection Authority located in your jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personally-identifiable information?</h2>
<p>The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information.  In addition, we restrict access to personally-identifiable information to our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Sites and Services.
