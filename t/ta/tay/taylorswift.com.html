<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Policy applies solely to our online information gathering and disclosure practices in connection with the Sites, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Policy answers the following questions:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><strong><em>What is our policy on children’s privacy?</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Sites are not for children under 13 years of age.&nbsp; However, there are some areas of the Sites that may be attractive to children under 13.&nbsp; We do not condition participation by a child of any age in any activity or any of the services available on or through the Sites on the disclosure of more personally-identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from users of the Sites who are under 13 years of age.&nbsp; No personally-identifiable information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Sites by visitors under 13 years of age without the prior written consent of their parent or guardian.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we receive an e-mail message from a child who discloses, or is otherwise known to us, to be under 13 years of age, we may, without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Respond to a one-time request from the child;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Provide notice of the child’s communication to the child’s parent or guardian;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Use this information as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the child on the Sites; or&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Send our electronic periodical publications and materials, with the notification to the child’s parent or guardian and the opportunity to discontinue any future delivery of the above information.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has provided personally-identifiable information to us may request a description of the personally-identifiable information that has been collected from or about that child, and either limit or restrict any further maintenance or use of such information from that child and/or direct us to delete it.&nbsp; Also, a parent may decline to allow any future collection of personally-identifiable information from that child.&nbsp; Such requests can be made by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:webmaster@taylorswift.com" target="_blank">webmaster@taylorswift.com</a>. We will take reasonable measures to verify that the requesting party is, in fact, the parent or guardian of the child in question before providing a child’s personally-identifiable information to such person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A parent may also access the personally-identifiable information that has been collected by us through accessing the “My Account” area of that parent’s child’s account by logging into the Sites with that child’s account name and password.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will not knowingly use or disclose any personally-identifiable information of a child under 13 years of age for any purpose except as described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><strong><em>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><strong><em>The types of information we collect and how we collect it</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By accessing or using the Sites, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information; and (2) non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of the technology called “cookies,” “web beacons” and/or “web logs.”&nbsp; You do not need to submit personally-identifiable information to access certain areas of the Sites, but if you do not want to disclose certain personally-identifiable information to us, you will not be able to access certain aspects of the Services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We collect personally-identifiable information when you create an account, subscribe to our mailing list, participate in chat rooms, forums, polls, surveys, and questionnaires, participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions, purchase a product, contact us, or receive customer or technical support. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To subscribe to our mailing list, you will need to provide your e-mail address, the country of your primary residence, your postal code and your date of birth.&nbsp; You will also need to create a screen name and password to access&nbsp; some of the other Services.&nbsp; When you are purchasing products, you will need to provide your name, address, e-mail address and phone number and, additionally, we or one of our third-party payment or fulfillment service providers will ask for your shipping and billing address and credit card, debit card or other payment information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">We may also collect other types of information (known as demographic information) such as your gender, hobbies and interests. This demographic information may be associated with your personally-identifiable information.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><strong><em>How we use your personally-identifiable information</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us will allow us to fulfill your product or service order, contact you about your account or your order of our products or services, alert you of new products or services, features or enhancements, notify you of changes in the Services, handle/route your customer service questions or issues, and/or inform you of contests, promotions, or special events and offers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We keep track of your interactions with us, including, but not limited to, your activity within the Services.&nbsp; We may use information relating to your interactions with us to generate information about the popularity of certain Services and how users of the Sites utilize different aspects of the Services (“<strong><em>Popularity Data</em></strong>”).&nbsp; We may use this Popularity Data to design, develop and implement additional services and features of the Sites and to improve the Services.&nbsp; Popularity Data may be associated with your account and we may provide a point system in which your account earns points through the amount of Popularity Data your account has achieved.&nbsp; These points may be displayed with the account information that is publicly displayed to other end users of the Sites, such as when you participate in a forum in the Sites, but we do not disclose the Popularity Data itself as associated with your account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">We may use personally-identifiable information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><strong><em>How we use your non-personally-identifiable information</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><em>Cookies</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We use “cookies” to collect information, on an aggregate basis, about how the Sites are used. This information may include the date and time of visits to the Sites and time spent on the Sites. The use of “cookies” allows us to personalize your use of the Sites and to provide greater convenience each time that you visit.&nbsp; Additionally, advertisements that are managed by third parties which may appear on the Sites use cookies.&nbsp; Advertisers use cookies to collect non-personal information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. Advertisers use this information to monitor the performance of their advertisements. In some cases, we may have access to information from cookies used by these advertisers on the Sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with such advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">You may choose to disable cookies on your computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your computer (please consult instructions for your web browser).

<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><strong><em>Will we share your personally-identifiable information with third parties?</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><strong><em>Sharing of information</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may disclose certain elements of your personally identifiable information (e.g., your name and e-mail address) with Taylor Swift and members of her management team, her employees,agents, contractors and sub-contractors, and her companies and subsidiaries, and their respective employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors, for the limited purpose of enabling them to communicate directly with you about upcoming musical performances, personal appearances, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, announcements and other special events.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may use your personally-identifiable information to provide analyses of our users in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, affiliation, position, interests and other non-personally-identifiable information about customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, we will share the personally-identifiable information we collect from you under the following circumstances:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li12"><span class="s1"><strong>Protection of rights</strong>.&nbsp; We will share personally-identifiable information if we have a good faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce the Terms of Use for the Sites, including any investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Services, or (iv) such action is appropriate to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our employees, users of the Services or others.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li12"><span class="s1"><strong>Asset transfers</strong>.&nbsp; If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information, including personally-identifiable information collected from you through your use of the Services, could be included in the transferred assets.&nbsp; Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through e-mail and/or a prominent notice on the Sites.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s1"><strong>Service Providers</strong>.&nbsp; We may share your personally-identifiable information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf.&nbsp; For example, we have partnered with other companies to sell products through the Services, fulfill product orders, process payments and administer our e-mail announcements.&nbsp; Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process consumer surveys, fulfill prizes, or to process, analyze and/or store data.&nbsp; While providing services for us, these companies may access your personally-identifiable information.&nbsp; To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="li8"><span class="s1"><strong>On-line Sweepstakes and Contests</strong>. We may share personally-identifiable information collected in connection with on-line contest, sweepstakes or other promotions with the third-party sponsors of such promotions, or otherwise as set forth in the Official Rules applicable to the promotion.&nbsp; You should carefully review the Official Rules of each promotion in which you choose to participate through the Sites, as they may contain additional important information about a third party’s use of your personally-identifiable information.&nbsp; To the extent any Official Rules conflict with this Policy, the Official Rules will govern that particular promotion.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><strong><em>Additional information you should know about third parties</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This Policy does not cover the information practices of third-party websites linked to any of the Sites.

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">When you click on an advertisement or third-party logo displayed on the Sites that links you to a different website, this Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or third party to see how your personally-identifiable information will be handled on their website.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Services may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.&nbsp; When you post to a message board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information you post is made publicly available on-line and you do so at your own risk.</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"><strong><em>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personally-identifiable information?</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="p10"><strong><em>Control of your information</em></strong></p>

<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><strong><em>Dispute resolution for residents of the European Economic Area</em></strong></span></p>
