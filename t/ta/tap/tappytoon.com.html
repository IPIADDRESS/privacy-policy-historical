    <h2><small> TappyToon User Privacy Policy<br>
      </small></h2>
    <p><small>Effective Date: January 1, 2015<br><br>
        TappyToon respects your privacy. We have adopted this privacy
        policy to inform users about how TappyToon gathers, stores, and
        uses information obtained from your use of TappyToon apps,
        products, services and online sites. <br>
        <br>
        This policy applies to information collected through our
        applications for mobile and tablet platforms (collectively the
        "App") and the TappyToon website (www.tappytoon.com, the
        "Site"). We may refer to the App and the Site collectively as
        our "Service."&nbsp;The comics, webtoons, media and other
        content offered through our service is referred to as "Content."
        Words such as "sale" or "purchase" (and similar terms, including
        all tenses), as applied to Content (including Content that the
        Service or Company offers for free), refer to the grant to you
        of a limited license as delineated in the applicable end user
        license agreement, terms of service or terms of use.<br>
        <br>
        The company that operates as TappyToon and provides the Service
        is Contents First, Inc (the "Company"). We may also refer to the
        Company by words such as "we," "us," or "our."<br>
        <br>
      </small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <h3><small>Collection of Information</small></h3>
    <small> By using our Service, users agree that we collect and
      process the personally identifiable information (as defined below)
      they provide by creating a TappyToon account, by purchasing 
      and accessing Content, or during any exchange with using the Service. We will not
      share any personally identifiable information with other parties
      except as described in this policy. <br>
      <br>
      We also process anonymous data, aggregated or not, in order to
      analyze and produce statistics related to the habits, usage
      patterns, and demographics of users as a group or as individuals.
      Such anonymous data does not allow the identification of the users
      to which it relates. TappyToon may share anonymous data,
      aggregated or not, with third parties.<br>
      <br>
    </small>
    <h3><small> Personally Identifiable Information</small></h3>
    <small> "Personally identifiable information" is information that
      can be used to uniquely identify a user such as name, email
      address and other relevant information that we may request. You
      may be asked to provide such personally identifiable information
      during the log in and sign up process, and then in connection with
      the use of our Service. While we collect personally identifiable
      information on a voluntary basis, for certain products and
      services our collecting of personally identifiable information may
      be a requirement for access to the Content or Service. <br>
      <br>
      When you purchase Content offered in the Service using your
      account with a third party app store (including but not limited to
      the Apple iTunes App Store, Goole Play Store and similar) we do
      not collect the credit card information that you use for such
      transactions, and we are not responsible for the policies and
      practices of such app stores.<br>
      <br>
    </small>
    <h3><small> Use of Personally Identifiable Information</small></h3>
    <small> Personally identifiable information is used internally by us
      to deliver, develop and improve products, the Content and Service,
      to which users have accessed, and to answer users' requests. <br>
      <br>
      We may use personally identifiable information provided by users
      to send them information about TappyToon, including news about
      Content updates, events, and other promotional materials, but only
      if the users agree to receive such communications. We will not
      share any personally identifiable information with third parties
      for marketing purposes without your consent.<br>
      <br>
      External websites and companies with links to and from our Service
      may collect personally identifiable information about users when
      users visit their websites.&nbsp; Our privacy policy does not
      extend to external websites and companies with links to or from
      our Service. Please refer directly to these companies and websites
      regarding their privacy policies.<br>
      <br>
      We may release personally identifiable information to comply with
      court orders or laws that require us to disclose such information.
      In the event of a reorganization, sale or merger we may transfer
      personally identifiable information to the relevant third party
      with the user's consent if required by law.<br>
      <br>
    </small>
    <h3><small> Cookies and Other Information on a User's Device </small></h3>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small>We use, and allow third parties to use, tracking
        technologies that enable the tracking and collection about your
        activity on our Service. Such tracking technologies may include
        cookies, pixel tags, and anonymous identifiers.</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <ol type="a">
      <small> </small>
    </ol>
    <small> We, or third parties with our permission, may use tracking
      technologies to: </small>
    <ul>
      <small> </small>
      <li><small>measure and analyze your activity in our Service and
          Content.&nbsp; <br>
        </small></li>
      <small> </small>
      <li><small>provide personalized recommendations, Content,
          advertising and other marketing materials base on your
          activity with our Service.</small></li>
      <small> </small>
      <li><small>remember actions you took so that you will not have to
          repeat them during a session</small></li>
      <small> </small>
      <li><small>manage, measure and improve the performance of our
          Service. In addition to the uses outlined above, we or any
          provider of such measurement and analytical services may
          provide non-personally identifiable data to third parties. </small></li>
      <small> </small>
    </ul>
    <small> </small>
    <p><small> Users can disable or delete cookies and limit the scope
        of such tracking technologies by changing their device or
        browser settings. Please consult the help section of your
        browser or device for further information about such measures.
        Should you reject or delete cookies, the related features or
        functions of our Service may be unavailable or your experience
        of the Service may be impaired.<br>
        <br>
      </small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <h3><small>Remarketing on Our Site and Service</small></h3>
    <small> We may use Google remarketing services, which allow third
      parties, including Google, to serve advertisements to you on our
      behalf based on your activity in our Service.&nbsp; This involves
      placing on our Site pages or Service a small piece of code
      provided by Google.&nbsp; This code enables third parties,
      including Google, to place a cookie on your device that tells them
      about your activity in the Service and allows them to recognize
      you and display relevant advertisements when you visit other
      websites within the Google Display Network. We may also use
      similar remarketing services from other companies.</small><br>
    <br>
    <h3><small> Children Under The Age of 13</small></h3>
    <small> We&nbsp;strongly believe in protecting the privacy of
      children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
      any person under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years of age,
      then please do not use the Service at any time or in any
      manner.&nbsp; We encourage parents and guardians to instruct their
      children to never give out personal information when online.
      Parents who are concerned about the transfer of personal
      information from their children may contact us.</small><br>
    <br>
    <h3><small> Choice and Opt-out</small></h3>
    <small> Users of our Service have the option to receive promotional
      email communications from TappyToon. Users may opt out of these
      communications. Instructions for discontinuing receipt of
      promotional email communications from TappyToon will be provided
      in email communications to users. Opting out of such
      communications does not preclude us from contacting users
      regarding non-promotional matters, including but not limited to
      user registration, legal, or other corporate responsibilities in
      the operation of our Service.</small><br>
    <br>
    <h3><small> Storage and Security of Personally Identifiable
        Information</small></h3>
    <small> Any data or information gathered in connection with our
      Service may be collected, processed, and stored in the United
      States, South Korea or other countries in which we do business or
      our service providers transfer, process, or store data. By using
      the Service, residents and citizens of countries and jurisdictions
      outside of the United States or South Korea agree and consent to
      the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers
      located in the United States or South Korea, and that the
      protection of such information may be different than required
      under the laws of your residence or location. We take reasonable
      steps to protect the information users share with us, including,
      but not limited to, setup of processes, equipment and software to
      avoid unauthorized access or disclosure of this information.
      However, you should understand that no system of data security is
      invulnerable.</small><br>
    <br>
    <h3><small> Corrections, Updates and Removal of Personally
        Identifiable Information</small></h3>
    <small> If you are concerned about the accuracy of personally
      identifiable information maintained by us or wish to review,
      access, amend or correct it, or would like your personally
      identifiable information removed from our records or otherwise
      deactivated, please contact us here. We may decline requests that
      are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical
      effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, impede or affect
      negatively our ability to provide our Content or Service, or are
      extremely impractical.</small><br>
    <br>
    <h3><small> Changes to this Policy</small></h3>
    <small> We may change this Policy at any time, with or without prior
      notice to you.&nbsp; We may notify you by posting or displaying a
      notice on this page, by email, through an update in the App or
      Service, or by any other reasonable method we choose in our
      discretion. Changes are effective when the revised Policy is made
      available on our Service or at such later date as may be stated in
      the revised Policy. Your use of the Service after a change is
      effective will be governed by the Policy as changed. Be sure to
      return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the
      most current version of this Privacy Policy.<br>
