    <font size="2"><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">TapJoy’s 
    Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the 
    personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions 
    when using TapJoy applications or accessing www.TapJoy.com.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">By using TapJoy applications 
    or accessing our website, you are accepting the practices described in this 
    Privacy Policy.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">If you have questions or 
    concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at 
    privacy@TapJoy.com</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <b><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">The Information We Collect</span></b><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">When you launch a TapJoy 
    application you provide us with four types of information: personal information 
    you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us; locational use 
    information collected by us as you interact with our services; usage information 
    that is collected by our servers as you use our applications; and information 
    related to third party services that you would like to access through our 
    applications and services.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">When you register with TapJoy, 
    you provide us with certain personal information, such as your username, your 
    email address and a photo representation (“avatar”) and any other personal or 
    preference information that you provide to us.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">When you launch or interact 
    with a TapJoy application, we collect your device type and IP address. This 
    information is gathered for all users. In addition, we use the unique Device ID 
    (“UUID”) that Apple makes available for each iPhone/iPod touch device in order 
    to authenticate the user session. This UUID functions similarly to a persistent 
    cookie to make it possible to authenticate the user without the need for a 
    password. You can disassociate a UUID from a user account at any time by 
    emailing us at privacy@TapJoy.com. You can also do so through a form accessible 
    through the Help button on the login/settings screen in each application.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">When you use TapJoy 
    applications, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send 
    messages, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this 
    information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized 
    features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to 
    view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you 
    update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a 
    reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that 
    information.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">You post User Content through 
    TapJoy applications at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy 
    options that limit access to your content and associated meta-data such as 
    location information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or 
    impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may 
    choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not 
    guarantee that User Content you post with Taplous will not be viewed by 
    unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy 
    settings or security measures contained in TapJoy applications. You understand 
    and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain 
    viewable in cached and archived form or if other Users have copied or stored 
    your User Content.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Any improper collection or 
    misuse of information provided on TapJoy applications is a violation of the 
    TapJoy Terms of Service and should be reported to privacy@TapJoy.com.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">If you choose to use our 
    invitation service to tell a friend about our applications, we may ask you for 
    information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend’s email address. 
    We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or instant message 
    inviting him or her to visit the site. TapJoy stores this information to send 
    this one-time invitation, to register a friend connection if your invitation is 
    accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may 
    contact us at privacy@TapJoy.com to request that we remove this information from 
    our database.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">TapJoy may also collect 
    information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant 
    messaging services, and other users of TapJoy applications through the operation 
    of the service in order to provide you with more useful information and a more 
    personalized experience.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">By using TapJoy, you are 
    consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United 
    States.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <b><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Third Party Services 
    Accessed by TapJoy</span></b><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">You can configure certain 
    third party services to be accessed by TapJoy applications and services. When 
    you do so, we will store your access credentials to such third party services in 
    a secure manner; we may temporarily cache your list of contacts from these 
    services; and we will store messages, photos and other content created using our 
    applications that are delivered to such third party services. We do this to 
    improve the performance and experience of these services (such as, adding photos 
    and location information not available in the third party services).</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <b><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Use of Information Obtained 
    by TapJoy</span></b><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">When you register with TapJoy, 
    you create your own profile. Your username and avatar (but not email address) 
    are displayed to other TapJoy users to enable you to connect with people on 
    TapJoy. We may occasionally use your username and email address to send you 
    notifications regarding new services offered by TapJoy that we think you may 
    find valuable.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">TapJoy may send you 
    service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of 
    the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message you may receive 
    an email or other notification alerting you to that fact.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">TapJoy may use information in 
    your profile or related to your activities on TapJoy applications in order to 
    personalize the application experience for you. TapJoy may also share 
    information such as user trends and application downloads in aggregate to third 
    parties without identifying you as an individual.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <b><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Sharing Your Information 
    with Third Parties</span></b><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">TapJoy is about users sharing 
    information with others. Some of our applications have privacy settings to allow 
    you to control what information is made available.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">We do not provide contact 
    information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your 
    information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe 
    such sharing is 1) necessary for business operations (e.g., emailing you through 
    a third party server such as Gmail), 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by 
    you.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">If the ownership of all or 
    substantially all of the TapJoy business, or individual business units owned by 
    LL Group, LLC, were to change, your user information may be transferred to the 
    new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of 
    information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in 
    any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <b><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Third Party Advertising</span></b><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Advertisements that may appear 
    on TapJoy are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly to users by third party 
    advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. In 
    this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your 
    computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements 
    are clicked. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <b><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Changing or Removing 
    Information</span></b><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">TapJoy users may modify or 
    delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their 
    account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to 
    deactivate their TapJoy account may do so by emailing us at privacy@TapJoy.com. 
    You can also do so through a form accessible through the Help button on the 
    login/settings screen in each application. Removed information may persist in 
    backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally 
    available to members of TapJoy.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Where you make use of the 
    communication features of the service to share information with other 
    individuals on TapJoy, however, (e.g., sending a direct message to another 
    TapJoy user) you generally cannot remove such communications.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <b><span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">Security</span></b><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">TapJoy takes appropriate 
    precautions to protect our users’ information. Your account information is 
    located on a secured server. If you have any questions about the security of 
    TapJoy applications, please contact us at privacy@TapJoy.com.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,serif;">
