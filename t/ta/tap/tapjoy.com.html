When interacting with Tapjoy's website, we record your IP address, "cookie" information and the page you requested. When you interact with Tapjoy's mobile applications or services we record your unique phone I.D. number (the "UDID") and logs of your specific interactions with Tapjoy-enabled applications or mobile websites. We may associate this usage information with your Personal Information in connection with providing the Tapjoy Services.</li>
<li>"Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer's or mobile device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some features of the Tapjoy Services.
