  information you may submit to Pretio Interactive, including your name,
  email address, reward gifts (“Gifts”) you send and receive, and other data you

  we gather automatically when you use the Service or our Website, including
  your IP address, browser type, cookie information, and browsing patterns.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Pretio
  Interactive does not own or control, or to individuals that Pretio Interactive
  does not employ or manage.</p>

<h3 id="personal-information-you-provide-to-us">Personal Information You Provide to Us</h3>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter through the Service or
  provide to us in any other way.</p>
<p>The types of information we collect include your name, email address,
  browser or mobile device information, and any other information necessary
  for us to provide the Service.</p>
<p>The information you provide is used to help you receive personalized Gifts,
  customize the content and advertising you see, and to communicate with you
  about specials and new features. We also draw upon this information to better

  data such as zip code, postal code, area code and location, cookie information,
  and browsing patterns. </p>

  access the Service or visit pages on our Website. You have the option to
  disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting
  cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you visit.

  information to our partners in order to help them understand how often people
  use their services and our Website. Pretio Interactive never discloses
  information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>

<h3 id="will-pretio-interactive-share-my-personal-information-with-other-parties-">Will Pretio Interactive Share My Personal Information With Other Parties?</h3>
<p>We share your Personal Information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
  In order to ensure your privacy is protected, Pretio Interactive does not
  share your personal information unless we have:</p>
<ol>
  <li>received your permission to share your personal information;</li>
  <li>Given you notice that we will share your personal information, such as by telling you about in this Privacy Policy; or</li>
  <li>removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Advertisers: </u> Pretio Interactive Inc. allows advertisers to choose the
  demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you
  agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you to
  select or allow the advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those
  advertisements. For example, we may allow an advertiser to target an ad to
  you based on your reward redemption history, demographics, location and/or
  application usage history.</p>
<p><u>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: </u>We are affiliated with a
  variety of businesses, including merchants who supply the Gifts and rewards
  we make available to you, and work closely with these businesses to deliver
  the Service. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through
  the Service and particularly through e-mails you may consent to receive from
  these businesses. In other situations, Pretio Interactive provides services
  or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize
  when an affiliated business is associated with a transaction, and we will
  share your personal information with that affiliated business that is related
  to the transaction you have entered into.</p>
<p><u>Agents: </u>We employ other companies and people to help us deliver the
  Service and need to share your information with them. Unless we tell you
  differently, Pretio Interactive’s agents do not have any right to use the
  Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us
  to deliver our products and services. You hereby consent to our sharing your
  personal information for the above purposes.</p>
<p><u>Promotional Offers sent by Pretio Interactive: </u>We may send offers to
  you on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the
  other business your Personal Information. If you do not wish to receive these
  offers, you will have the option to unsubscribe using a link found at the
  bottom of the email. We may provide certain of your Personal Information to
  third parties if you affirmatively allow us to do so by opting in to an offer
  we make to you.</p>
<p><u>Promotional Offers sent by Third Parties: </u>We partner with third parties
  who use Pretio Interactive to send promotions to their current customers via
  email, social media, and other means. If you are directed to Pretio Interactive
  as a result of a third-party campaign, we may share certain Personal Information
  with the third party who referred you. You hereby consent to our sharing of
  Personal Information in such cases and acknowledge that such information may
  be retained by the third party even if you delete your Pretio Interactive
  account.</p>
<p><u>Business Transfers: </u>In some cases, Pretio Interactive may undergo a
  business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or
  sale of all or a portion of its assets. In these types of transactions,
  customer information is typically one of the business assets that is
  transferred. Moreover, if Pretio Interactive, or substantially all of its
  assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pretio Interactive goes
  out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of
  the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge
  that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pretio Interactive
  may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<p><u>Protection of Pretio Interactive and Others: </u>We may release personal
  information to appropriate third parties when we believe in good faith that
  we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary
  in order (a) to comply with legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena,
  court order or in connection with litigation, (b) to protect Pretio
  Interactive’s rights and property, (c) to investigate, prevent, or take action
  regarding illegal activities, including intellectual property infringement,
  fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or
  personal safety of any person, or (d) to protect against misuse or
  unauthorized use of the Service. </p>
<p><u>With Your Consent: </u>Except as set forth above, you will be notified
  when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be
  able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>

<h3 id="is-my-personal-information-secure-">Is My Personal Information Secure?</h3>
<p>Pretio Interactive endeavors to ensure that personal information is kept
  secure and has in place industry standard security infrastructure and processes
  to do so. However, because transmission of data over the Internet cannot be
  completely secure, Pretio Interactive cannot guarantee that unauthorized
  access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. </p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-change-or-remove-information-on-pretio-interactive-">How Can I Change or Remove Personal Information You Have Provided to Pretio Interactive?</h3>
<p>If you believe that your personal information that we have is incorrect or
  you wish to remove personal information, please e-mail Pretio Interactive at
  support@pretiointeractive.com and we will assist you.  Please note that we may
  retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate
  business purposes.</p>

<p>The Service is not intended for children under the age of 18 and we do not
  knowingly collect any personal Information from such children. If we discover
  that we have inadvertently collected personal Information from children, we

  and records as soon as possible.</p>

  other online services or offers from third parties, such as third party
  advertisers or merchants.  If you choose to participate in a reward offer or
  ‘click’ an advertisement or other third party link, you may be directed to
  that third party’s website or service and/or be prompted to provide personal
  information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
  of such third party websites or services, including our merchants. If you
  have any questions about how these third party websites or services use your
  information, you should review their policies or contact them directly.</p>

  time to time and will post a current version of the Privacy Policy at
  <a href="http://privacy.pretio.in/">http://privacy.pretio.in/.</a> By

  to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. </p>
