<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tapatalk, Inc.
(“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Tapatalk</b>,” “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">we</b>,” “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">our</b>,” or “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">us</b>”),
a Delaware corporation located in the United States of America, is an
online and mobile aggregator of forums and communications platforms
(“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Service</b>”). Tapatalk operates the Service on
http://www.tapatalk.com (“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Website</b>”) and on Tapatalk’s
mobile application available on various mobile operating systems
(“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Application</b>”).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This Privacy
Policy describes Tapatalk’s collection, use and sharing of
personally identifiable information, which may include your first and
last name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number, and
the username and email address of your friends you invite to use the
Service that you voluntarily provide when using the Service (“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">PII</b>”)
through the Website or the Application. This Privacy Policy also
explains how we collect, use and share information based on your
interactions with the Service. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Service is
hosted in the United States and is available through our Website and
the Application, and is not directed to individuals under the age of
thirteen (13). Tapatalk does not knowingly collect PII from
individuals under thirteen (13) years of age.  You authorize us to
use the information collected in connection with your use of the
Service as described in this Privacy Policy, which may involve
transferring and storing such information across and outside your
country to a country (such as a country outside of the European
Economic Area) that may provide a different level of protection for
such information.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>BY USING THE
SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD,
AND AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, OR DO NOT
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP
USING THE SERVICE.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>PUBLIC FORUMS;
FOLLOWING USERS AND THREADS; OPT-OUT; INVITE A FRIEND</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tapatalk makes
chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to
users of the Service. Please remember that any information that is
disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should
exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information
on any forum.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>After you join a
forum via the Service, Tapatalk may transmit information you provide
or we gather (such as email address or information provided through
your Facebook or GOOGLE + account if you use it as your Tapatalk
forum login) to the requested forum.  We do not store on our servers
any email addresses, usernames or passwords except for those provided
by you for use with your Tapatalk account, or the username and email
address we obtain from the applicable forum if you utilize the invite
a friend feature. If you use Log in with Facebook to login into the
Application, we collect and store certain information described
below.  
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We provide
features in the Service that allow you to follow other users,
specific forums, sub-forums, or threads. These features will also
allow other users to follow you or follow specific forum threads that
you make via the Service. In the event that you do not want to allow
other users to follow you or your forum threads, please visit the
Settings section in the Application to make certain information
private where available.  In addition, we provide a feature for you
to invite your friends to use the Service.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>INFORMATION COLLECTED</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When you register
with us and use the Service, you provide&nbsp;your name, email
address, user name, password and other registration information. We
also collect non-personally identifiable information (“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Non-PII</b>”)
about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities
through your IP address and an anonymous device identifier, some of
which may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions in
the European Union and elsewhere, but none of this data identifies
you individually. On the Website, Tapatalk may automatically gather
Non-PII that browsers automatically make available, including IP
addresses, domain servers, types of computers accessing the Website,
and types of web browsers accessing the Website. In addition, the
Application collects certain Non-PII automatically, including the
type of mobile device, mobile operating system and mobile Internet
browser you use, an anonymous mobile device identifier, the IP
address of your mobile device, and information about the way you use
the Application. This information will not identify you and is
therefore considered Non-PII. We do not collect any PII about you
unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for
example, filling out a survey or registration form.&nbsp; To be
clear, we do not collect any “sensitive personal data” as defined
in the European Union. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If you use Log in
with Facebook or GOOGLE + to login into the Application, we collect
and store certain additional information such as your birthdate,
likes, friends, etc.  These services will authenticate your identity
and provide you the option to share (or not share) certain PII and
other information with us such as your name and email address to
create a Tapatalk ID. Services like Log in with Facebook give you the
option to post information about your Tapatalk forum activities to
your Facebook profile page to share with others within your Facebook
network.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If you choose to
invite your friends to use the Service, your friend will receive an
email request from the Service.  You agree only to invite friends who
you think would be interested in using the Service. Your friend may
use the unsubscribe link in the footer of the invite to be removed
from receiving future invites.  
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>USE AND SHARING
OF INFORMATION</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In general, we
will only use the information you provide to us for the purpose for
which such information was provided.  In addition, we may use certain
information we receive if you use Log in with Facebook or GOOGLE + to
login into the Application (as described above) and non-personal
demographic and profile data we obtain through your use of the
Service to tailor your experience on the Website or using the
Application, including, showing you content we think you might be
interested in, recommendations of forums to follow, and advertising.
This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregated
and Non-PII basis.  If you provide us information about your friends
that you want to invite to use the Service, we will automatically
send your friend an email inviting him/her to use the Service. 
Tapatalk stores this information to make sure your friend does not
receive too many invites to join the Service from other forum users,
and to enable your friend to unsubscribe from future emails.  
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The information,
including PII, we receive from you and through your use of the
Service may be used or shared by us with third parties, including
marketing businesses, lead generation businesses, email service
providers, our forum partners, and our corporate affiliates
(collectively “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Affiliates</b>”). This information may be used
to deliver you information about our company and promotional material
from some of our Affiliates, including about products and services
that may be of interest to you, as well as by us for trend analysis,
pattern detection, and site administration. When you choose to follow
a forum, we will send your name, username, and email to the
applicable forum so that you become a member of that forum, and you
agree to comply with the rules, regulations, end-user license
agreement, and terms of service of each such forum. Your information
may also be used to contact you when necessary.  You may opt-out of
receiving future mailings from us by following the instructions set
forth in the Email Opt-Out section below. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In addition,
there may be other instances when Tapatalk may access or disclose PII
or Non-PII, including under the following circumstances: (i) to
protect or defend the legal rights or property of Tapatalk and its
Affiliates; (ii) to protect the safety and security of users of the
Service or members of the public including acting in urgent
circumstances; (iii) to protect against fraud or for risk management
purposes; or (iv) to comply with applicable law or legal process.
Further, if Tapatalk sells all or part of its business or sells or
transfers all or a material part of its assets, or is otherwise
involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its
business, we may transfer your PII or Non-PII to the party or parties
involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>USE OF IP
ADDRESSES</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We use your IP
Address or equivalent mobile geo-identifier to locate users by
country; help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer
the Service.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>USE OF COOKIES,<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
</b>BEACONS, AND PIXEL TAGS</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When you use the
Website we might store some information on your computer. This
information may be in the form of a "cookie" “web beacon”
or similar file. “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Cookies</b>” are small identifiers sent from
a web server that are stored on your computer’s hard drive for the
purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on Websites. 
“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Web Beacons</b>” are invisible electronic images, called a
single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, which can recognize certain types of
information on your computer, such as a Cookie number, time and date
of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web Beacon is
placed. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We use Cookies to
deliver content specific to your interests, including advertising and
to enable you to from having to reenter all your registration data at
each connection. We may use an outside advertisement server company
to display ads on the Website or Application. These ads may contain
Cookies. The advertisement server company may collect Cookies
received with outside banner ads. We do not have access to
information that would confirm the use of cookies by the
advertisement server company. You can learn more about how to delete
or control Cookies at <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">www.aboutcookies.org</a>.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
</b>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We may allow
third parties to collect the anonymous data received from Cookies and
Web Beacons on our behalf, and to retain and use this data
themselves. In addition, we may share this anonymous data with other
third parties. To protect your privacy, we do not use Cookies or Web
Beacons to store or transmit any PII about you. You have the ability
to accept or decline Cookies. Most web browsers and mobile
automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually modify your
browser’s or mobile device’s setting to decline Cookies if you
prefer. If you choose to decline Cookies, certain features of our
Website may not function properly or not at all as a result. You may
render some Web Beacons unusable by rejecting their associated
cookies.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>From time to
time, we may place Cookies and Web Beacons on your computer or mobile
device to collect anonymous data related to your use of our Website
and your use of the Application, including Service usage analytics,
and content and advertising personalization. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>ANALYTICS SERVICE
PROVIDERS</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We may allow
certain third-party analytics service providers to include web
beacons within the pages of our Website and anonymous identifiers on
the Application. We may also share portions of our log file data,
including IP addresses, with these service providers for analytics
purposes. These service providers aggregate information about what
you see and interact with on our Website and on the Application.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>These service
providers offer information about their data collection practices,
and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective Websites. We allow
web beacons from and share log file data with these service
providers.  To obtain a list of these service providers in order to
request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls
that may be available to you, please email us at
privacy@tapatalk.com. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>None of the PII
that you provide to us when using the Service is shared with our
third party analytics service providers as part of our analytics
programs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>ADVERTISEMENTS;
AD NETWORKS; OTHER THIRD PARTIES</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We may allow
certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and
collect anonymous information regarding your use of the Service.
Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies,
technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research
firms, and they may include cookies and web beacons within our
Website, or other tracking methodologies such as anonymous device
identifiers on the Website and/or Application to collect anonymous
information in order to provide customized content and/or ads,
auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and
advertisers when you visit certain pages of the Website or
Application, and other websites or applications. For example, because
your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons
from the third-party’s web servers, these companies can view, edit
or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from
their website directly.  When you view or interact with an
advertisement, the possibility exists that these companies will make
the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the
advertisements.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In addition, we
or a data partner we have engaged may collect and store a unique
identifier matched to your mobile device, in order to deliver
customized ads or content while you use the Service or other websites
or applications, or to seek to identify you in a unique manner across
other devices or browsers.  In order to customize these ads or
content, we or our data partners may connect de-identified
demographic or other data about you (received from third parties)
either to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your
email address), or to data passively collected from you (such as your
device identifier or IP address).  However, we will only share your
email address with our data partner in hashed, non-human readable
form.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The above
third-party companies offer information about their data collection
practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective
websites. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request
their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that
may be available to you, please email us at <a href="mailto:admin@tapatalk.com">privacy@tapatalk.com</a>.
You can also learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out
capabilities at the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network
Advertising Initiative Website</a> or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital
Advertising Alliance Website</a>. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Please note this
does not opt you out of being served advertising. If you use the
Service after opting out, you will continue to receive generic
advertisements. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>LINKS</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Service may
contain links to websites, forums, or applications not operated by
Tapatalk. The Service may also carry advertisements from third party
companies not associated with Tapatalk. Tapatalk is not responsible
for the privacy practices of websites, forums, or applications or
other services operated by third parties that are linked to or
integrated with the Service or for the privacy practices of third
party advertising companies. Once you leave the Service via such a
link, access a forum, a third party application or click on an
advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the
forum, third party, or advertiser site to determine, among other
things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>WIDGETS</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We may include a
widget from a third party on the Website or on the Application that
allows interaction or content sharing by users. “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Widgets</b>”
are mini-programs that provide specific services or content from a
third party. These Widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like”
button, may be visible to you on a forum page or entry you visit. The
third party providing the Widget may offer controls for you to manage
the Widget’s appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a
Widget typically allows the third party to collect some information
about you through the third party’s cookies or its registration
information. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through
its Widgets and cookies even when you do not interact with the
Widget. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request
their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that
may be available to you, please email us at <a href="mailto:admin@tapatalk.com">privacy@tapatalk.com</a>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>DO NOT TRACK</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Do Not Track
(“<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">DNT</b>”) is a privacy preference that users can set in
their web browsers. Tapatalk honors DNT settings in your browser, but
will override such setting in the event that you turn on the
“Remember Me” feature in the Service settings. If you want
Tapatalk to fully honor DNT headings from your browser, visit
settings and turn the “Remember Me” feature to the “Off”
position.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>SECURITY</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tapatalk uses
commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and
physical security measures designed to safeguard PII in our
possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or
modification. In addition, Tapatalk uses reasonable methods in an
effort to make sure that the PII we store about you is consistent
with the updated information you provide to us. When we provide
information to our third party advertising or analytics partners, any
and all PII such as email addresses and mobile device identifiers are
encrypted. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>CORRECT OR UPDATE
YOUR INFORMATION</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tapatalk allows
its users the option to change or modify information previously
provided. This may be done through the following methods:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(1) e-mail the
information to privacy@tapatalk.com <br>(2) visit the Community
Support section of the Website or in the Application and follow the
appropriate instructions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Unfortunately, to
the extent that such information is also stored in other databases,
we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will reach
the other databases. We will use all reasonable efforts to ensure
that your information is removed from or corrected in our records.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>EMAIL OPT OUT</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>You may opt-out
of receiving communications from us, by clicking on the “unsubscribe”
link in the communication emails you have received from us.

FRAMEWORK</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tapatalk complies
with the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of
notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access,
and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to
view our certification, please visit the <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/">U.S.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>CHANGES TO THIS
PRIVACY POLICY</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>From time to time
Tapatalk may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry
initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use
practices, changes in the features of the Service, or technology, and
such modifications shall be effective upon posting by Tapatalk on our
Website or in a update to the Application. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><a name="_GoBack"></a>
Your continued use of the Service after Tapatalk posts a revised
Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy
Policy. Therefore, it is important that you review this Privacy
Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. 
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If Tapatalk
materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your
PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy
under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of,
and have not objected to, the change. Our Privacy Policy was last
updated on and is effective as of December 30, 2014.
