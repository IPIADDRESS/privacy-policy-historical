However, to access certain portions of the website, you may have to submit information such as a user-id and password, or you may have to provide personal information such as your name, address and e-mail.</p>
<p>To complete online transactions, you will be asked for your address, e-mail and credit card information. This required information is necessary for us to process transactions, protect you against credit card fraud and contact you should the need arise in administering your account.</p>
<p>Our site may contain surveys, trivia games and other forms for collecting information.</p>
<p><strong>Information security and quality</strong><br>The U.S. Fund for UNICEF intends to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures, including industry-standard encryption for transmission of credit card information, to help keep your information secure, accurate, current and complete.</p>
<p>Donations made on the <a href="http://www.unicefusa.org/">http://www.unicefusa.org/</a> website are secure to the fullest extent possible. We use strong 128-bit encryption through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL protects information as it is transferred through the Internet.</p>

We also collect information on which pages you visit while you are on our site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our site. We use this information only to try to better understand visitor preferences.</p>
<p><strong>"Cookies"<br></strong>We sometimes use "cookies" to collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide better service. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. We may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better service, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. In order to improve the quality of our communications, we may also from time to time share such anonymous information with certain third parties, such as our advertising and media vendors, including, without limitation, advertising.com.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of our site may not function properly.</p>

However, from time to time we make our postal mailing list available to other worthy organizations. If you prefer that your postal information not be shared, please write to us at <a title="E-mail webmaster@unicefusa.org" href="mailto:webmaster@unicefusa.org">webmaster@unicefusa.org</a> and we will honor your wishes immediately.</p>

The U.S. Fund may also provides e-mail marketing tools to some website visitors who have created personal web pages. These tools provide convenient ways to communicate with friends and family on a personal level; they are not designed for sending out bulk emails.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized webpages</strong><br>The U.S. Fund for UNICEF may allow some constituents to create web content (including e-mail) that brings visitors to personalized webpages. Such personal webpages, as well as the individual associated with the page, are readily identifiable.

<p>Please note that we try to ensure that all our activities (particularly the annual "Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF" campaign) are coordinated by an adult and therefore make every effort to send information to adults only.

The full text of the Donor Bill of Rights follows.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>"Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the not-for-profit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:</p>
<p>I. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.</p>
<p>II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.</p>
<p>III. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.</p>
<p>IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.</p>
<p>V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.</p>
<p>VI. To be assured that information about their donations is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.</p>
<p>VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.</p>
<p>VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.</p>
<p>IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.</p>
<p>X. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers."</p></blockquote></td>
