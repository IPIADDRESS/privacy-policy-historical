You may be required to provide financial information before placing an order through our Website.&nbsp;</li><li>Your search queries on the Website.&nbsp;</li><li>We may also collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us&nbsp;(for example via submit form).

Similarly, if you use our Website to upload, share or distribute content (including videos, comments or other submissions), and such content contains personal information about others, such information may be stored&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;allow for such uploading,&nbsp;sharing or distribution.&nbsp;In case you upload, share, distribute or otherwise make accessible personal data of third persons, you warrant that you have obtained all necessary legal permissions of the data subjects/persons concerned, and you agree to hold us fully harmless against any claims that such third persons may lodge against us, in particular (but not limited to) claims arising out of data protection or personality rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>When you access our Website from a mobile device like a tablet or phone, we may receive information about your location, your device, including one or more unique identifiers for your device, and your mobile carrier. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most devices allow you to turn off location services.&nbsp;</li><li>You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, <strong>“posted”</strong>) on public&nbsp;areas of the website, or&nbsp;transmitted to other users of the Website or third parties (collectively, <strong>“User Contributions”</strong>). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk.&nbsp;In case you upload, share, distribute or otherwise make accessible personal data of third persons, you warrant that you have obtained all necessary legal permissions of the data subjects/persons concerned, and you agree to hold us fully harmless against any claims that such third persons may lodge against us, in particular (but not limited to) claims arising out of data protection or personality rights.&nbsp;Although, we may limit access to certain pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee, to the extent permissible by law,&nbsp;that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Information We May Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies&nbsp;</h2><p>As you navigate through and interact with our Website, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>details of your visits to our Website, including any form of aggregate data, navigational data, tracking data, location data, click-stream data, or historical data, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information, log files and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website; and&nbsp;</li><li>information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us. An IP, or “Internet Protocol”, address is a unique number associated with your computer that may be communicated to other computers and servers when you use the Internet. The information collected may include the domain name of your internet service provider, referral data (e.g., the address of the last page you visited prior to clicking through to the Website and the address of the exit page when you left our Website) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform). We use this information to track how users are accessing and using the Website.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). See “Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information” below for information on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on this Website and how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise choice about behavioral tracking.&nbsp;</p><p>The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personal information, or we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. It helps us to improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>estimate our audience size and usage patterns;&nbsp;</li><li>store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website according to your individual interests;&nbsp;</li><li>speed up your searches; and&nbsp;</li><li>recognize you when you return to our Website.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-aria-level="1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-font="Symbol" data-leveltext="" data-listid="8"><p><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (i) to enable certain functions; (ii) to provide analytics; (iii) to store your preferences; and (iv) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>We currently use the following types of cookies:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><em>Cookies that are strictly necessary</em>: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log into the members’ area of our Website and to check if a user is allowed access to a&nbsp;particular service&nbsp;or content.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Analytical cookies: </em>These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of users and to see how users use and explore our Website. These cookies help us to improve our Website, for example by ensuring that all users&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;find what they are looking for easily.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Functionality cookies:</em> We are always glad to see you back. This type of cookies allows us to recognize you when you return to our Website&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;greet you by name and to remember, for example, your choice of language.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Targeting cookies:</em> These cookies record the visit of a user on our Website, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has followed&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;enable us to make our Website more relevant to the users’ interests. In addition, these cookies are used to identify the websites and the marketing materials you are accessing our Website from&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;target content (for example, to automatically show you our Website according to your language settings).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We do not require that you accept cookies and you may withdraw your consent to our use of cookies at any time by adjusting your browser’s privacy settings. However, if you decline to accept cookies, some functionality on our Website may be disabled and you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it&nbsp;expires&nbsp;or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see “Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information”.&nbsp;</li><li>Web Beacons.&nbsp;Pages of our&nbsp;Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in an email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Device identifiers.</strong> When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Website, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, or remotely store one or more “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by the Website. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a&nbsp;third party&nbsp;partner about how you browse and use the Website and may help others or us provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Website may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Metadata.</strong> Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Contributions. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Contribution was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Contribution including a hashtag, comments or other data. This makes your User Contribution more searchable by others and more interactive.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Analytics Tools.</strong> We use analytics tools and other&nbsp;third party&nbsp;technologies, such as Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies, to collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our Website. These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics&nbsp;and statistics, usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device identifiers, and other similar information. The&nbsp;third party&nbsp;analytics companies who collect information on our Website and other online products or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. In addition to our use of technologies as described herein, we may permit certain&nbsp;third party&nbsp;companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to you based on your use of our Website and to otherwise collect and use data about your use of our Website. For more information about this practice, please see the “Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section below. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>The information generated by Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies about your use of the Website (including your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate / anonymize the last octet of a&nbsp;particular IP&nbsp;address. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. Google will use this information&nbsp;for the purpose of&nbsp;evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage to the Website. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. &nbsp;<br><br> You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.

These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, risk and fraud detection and mitigation, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our Website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Website. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.&nbsp;</li><li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or&nbsp;all of&nbsp;our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our Website users is among the assets transferred.&nbsp;</li><li>To third parties to market their products or services to you if you have consented to these disclosures.&nbsp;</li><li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.&nbsp;</li><li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.&nbsp;</li><li>With your consent.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We may also disclose your personal information:&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-aria-level="1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-font="Symbol" data-leveltext="" data-listid="11"><p>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order or other judicial or administrative order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law (including responding to any government or regulatory request).

We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change&nbsp;you&nbsp;preferences directly with that third party.&nbsp;</li><li>If you submit personal information, you may delete your account with us at any time. If you delete your account, your personal information and&nbsp;any and all&nbsp;other account related information including, but not limited to, user profile data, sharing data and any other data, or content specifically associated with your account will no longer be accessible by you. After deleting your account, if you choose to have an account with us in the future, you will have to sign up for a new account as none of the information you previously provided or saved within your account will have been saved.&nbsp;</li><li>You can disable the location services on your mobile device or tablet. Most likely, these controls&nbsp;are located in&nbsp;the device’s settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device’s location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How We Protect Your Personal Information&nbsp;</h2><p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure.&nbsp;Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications would always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.&nbsp;</p><h2>User Contributions&nbsp;</h2><p>We may provide areas on our Website where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.), and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are governed by our&nbsp;Terms of&nbsp;Service or Service Agreement. If you use a forum, blog, channel, bulletin board, chat room, user commenting features, or other interactive sharing or social features that may be offered through our Website, you should be aware that any personal information you submit, display, or publish there is considered publicly available and can be read, collected, used, and disclosed by other users of those features, by us, and other third parties without restriction, except to the extent limited access features are available, if any. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed&nbsp;on the subject of your&nbsp;posting. If you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information. To request removal of your personal information from our blog, sharing service or community forum, for example, send us an e-mail at <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('kygjrm8fcjnYqglqsnnmpr,amk');" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">sinsupport.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By using our Website, you agree to hold us fully harmless against any legal actions or claims, which third persons may lodge against us based on postings or information you upload to the Website (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.), and you warrant that whenever you make such postings or uploads which may concern the rights of third persons, you have&nbsp;obtain&nbsp;all necessary legal permissions to make such postings or uploads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Accessing and Correcting Your Information&nbsp;</h2><p>You may, at any time, send us an e-mail at <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('kygjrm8npgtyawYbgkcky,af');" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">privacy<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">document.write('&#64;');</script>@dimema.ch</a> to request access to, correct or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us, except personal information or data that is necessary for administration purposes or for fraud prevention measures. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> If you delete your User Contributions from the Website, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or might have been copied or stored by other Website users.&nbsp;Proper access and use of information provided on the Website, including User Contributions, is governed by our&nbsp;Terms of Service or Service Agreement.&nbsp;</p><h2>Financial Information&nbsp;</h2><p>Any financial data that you have provided to us will only be shared with the Website’s&nbsp;third party&nbsp;processors in order to initiate and complete any orders placed on your account. All credit card transactions and such are processed with industry standard encryption through third party processors who only use your information for that purpose. All financial data and information shall be considered&nbsp;private information&nbsp;and will not be shared by the Website with third parties except with your authorization or when necessary to carry out all and any transactions requested by the user with the understanding that such transactions may be subject to rules, terms, conditions and policies of a third party. All such information provided to a third party and all transactions are not governed by this privacy policy. All such information provided to a third party is subject to their terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Third Party Login Functionality&nbsp;</h2><p>We may permit users with accounts on certain&nbsp;third party&nbsp;services, including but not limited to, social networking, search, sharing, and other services delivered by third parties, to bypass the standard applicable registration process. If you connect through an authorized&nbsp;third party&nbsp;service, you will be able to use your third party login information to log in to your account or access our content and Website. We are, to the extent permissible by law,&nbsp;not responsible for the sharing, posting, commenting, or other content and information gathering practices of any&nbsp;third party&nbsp;services that may be triggered by using these third party login services. Please review their terms of service and privacy policies carefully before using third party login functionality to access our Website. <br><br> By using any&nbsp;third party&nbsp;services to log in to your account or access our Website, you permit us to access, store and use all information related to your third party account that may be accessible to us through the third party service, including through its application programming interface (API), pursuant to this privacy policy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy&nbsp;</h2><p>We may modify or revise our privacy policy from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to this privacy policy, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date&nbsp;version so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.&nbsp;If we change anything in our privacy policy, the date of change will be reflected in the “last modified date”. You agree that you will periodically review this privacy policy and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision to our privacy policy. If the “last modified” date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed our privacy policy, then it is unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review our privacy policy, and you agree to the new ones.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> All changes are effective immediately when we post&nbsp;them, and&nbsp;apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. The updated version of our privacy policy supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. If you do not review&nbsp;new terms&nbsp;as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. By continuing to use the Website&nbsp;subsequent to&nbsp;us making available an amended version of our privacy policy, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.&nbsp;</p><h2>Enforcement&nbsp;</h2><p>We regularly review our compliance with this privacy policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy or our treatment of personal information by contacting us through this Website at <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('kygjrm8npgtyawYbgkcky,af');" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">privacy<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">document.write('&#64;');</script>@dimema.ch</a>&nbsp;When we receive a formal written complaint, it is our policy to contact the complaining party regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved by an individual and us.&nbsp;</p><h2>No Rights of Third Parties&nbsp;</h2><p>This privacy policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Website.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our Policy Towards Children&nbsp;</h2><p>Our Website is not directed to children. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('kygjrm8qsnnmprYzyzcq,amk');" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">sinsupport.com</a>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.&nbsp;</p><h2>No Error Free Performance&nbsp;</h2><p>We do not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. We shall, to the extent permissible by law,&nbsp;not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this privacy policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Governing Law and Place of Jurisdiction&nbsp;</h2><p>The laws of&nbsp;Switzerland&nbsp;shall&nbsp;exclusively&nbsp;govern this privacy policy.&nbsp;Any dispute arising out of, or in connection with, the use of the Site shall exclusively be brought to the competent court available at the domicile of&nbsp;Digital Media Management GmbH&nbsp;in&nbsp;Baar, Switzerland&nbsp;</p><h2>Contact Information&nbsp;</h2><p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our information-handling practices, please contact us at <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('kygjrm8npgtyawYbgkcky,af\u00a0');">privacy@dimema.ch&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Final Information and Description of&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Most Important Rights&nbsp;</h2><p>For any further queries, please find below our full contact details:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Digital Media Management GmbH&nbsp;</p><p>C/O Data Protection Supervisor&nbsp;</p><p>Zugerstrasse&nbsp;74, 6143&nbsp;Baar, Switzerland&nbsp;</p></div>
