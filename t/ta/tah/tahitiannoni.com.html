<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What Personal Information About Customers Does Morinda Bioactives Gather on Our Website? </b></p>
<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your ability to gather information and make purchases at Morinda Bioactives's website. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Information You Give Us: </b>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as filling your orders, responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our web services, and communicating with you. Typical information we store about you includes; name, main address, shipping address, tax ID, credit card number, email address, bank account number (if supplied), telephone and fax numbers, etc. </li>
<li><b>Automatic Information (cookies): </b>Like many web sites, we obtain certain types of information when your web browser contacts Morinda Bioactives's site. We store this information in small data repositories commonly called “cookies.” The data stored in cookies enable Morinda Bioactives's systems to recognize your browser and to provide features customized to you. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include: the temporary session ID, customer level (advanced or basic service), referring distributor ID, pages visited on Morinda Bioactives's site, and which “pop-up” advertisements the visitor has already seen. The information we store in cookies does not include personal information, and Morinda Bioactives hopes you are comfortable knowing that Morinda Bioactives only uses this information to make your visit to our Internet site more enjoyable and productive. However, some people prefer not to have cookies stored on their computers due to privacy concerns. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Morinda Bioactives's website features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. </li>
<li><b>Email Communications: </b>To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we may receive a confirmation when you open email from Morinda Bioactives if your computer supports such capabilities. We <b>will not </b>share your email address with any other company or individual. </li>

<li><b>Agents: </b>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These entities have access to personal information only when needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </li>
<li><b>Promotional Offers: </b>We do not send offers to any Morinda Bioactives customers on behalf of other businesses. </li>
<li><b>Protection of Morinda Bioactives and Others: </b>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our policies and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Morinda Bioactives, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>How Secure Is Information About Me? </b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SSL:</b>&nbsp; We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. </li>
