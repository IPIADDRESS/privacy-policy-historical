<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your ability to gather information and make purchases at Tahitian Noni International's website. Here are the types of information we gather. </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Information You Give Us: </strong>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as filling your orders, responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our web services, and communicating with you. Typical information we store about you includes; name, main address, shipping address, tax ID, credit card number, email address, bank account number (if supplied), telephone and fax numbers, etc. 
</li><li><strong>Automatic Information (cookies): </strong>Like many web sites, we obtain certain types of information when your web browser contacts Tahitian Noni International's site. We store this information in small data repositories commonly called “cookies.” The data stored in cookies enable Tahitian Noni International's systems to recognize your browser and to provide features customized to you. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include: the temporary session ID, customer level (advanced or basic service), referring distributor ID, pages visited on Tahitian Noni International's site, and which “pop-up” advertisements the visitor has already seen. The information we store in cookies does not include personal information, and Tahitian Noni International hopes you are comfortable knowing that Tahitian Noni International only uses this information to make your visit to our Internet site more enjoyable and productive. However, some people prefer not to have cookies stored on their computers due to privacy concerns. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Tahitian Noni International's website features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
