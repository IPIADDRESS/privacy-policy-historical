  <h1>Tahometerâ€™s Privacy Policy.</h1>
  <p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.8em; padding-bottom: 30px;">Last revision: September 4, 2017.</p>

  <h1>Defined Terms</h1>

  <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Us," "we," "our," "service" and "Tahometer" all have the same meaning. "Information" and "content" are used more generally, but are also interchangeable.</p>
  <p>We want to earn your trust by being transparent about how Tahometer works. This is why we encourage you to read this policy in its entirety, but please pay close attention to these three main points:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tahometer is designed to make it easy for you to share your activity information with anyone you want. You decide how much information you feel comfortable sharing and control how this data is distributed through your privacy settings. Note that you should always review the information  and consider your privacy settings before sharing any data.</li>
    <li>Tahometer is not just a website. It is also a standalone service that tracks your activity and uploads the gathered data to our servers. You can, however, control how you share this activity through Tahometer's application settings.</li>
    <li>In the future, we plan to allow making more specific information such as your name, profile, skills, geographic region and total statistics available to everyone. You will, however, still be able to limit how others can find and see this information through your search privacy settings. This information will also not be accessible to others by default.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Security</h1>
  <p>Because any personal information you submit to Tahometer is done on a purely voluntary basis and should not be of a sensitive nature, we employ our standard security measures with respect to this information and do not use any special encryption methods at this time. This means Tahometer user accounts are secured by user-created passwords only. As a result, please note that we cannot guarantee the full security of your account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any moment.</p>

  <h1>Information We Collect</h1>
  <p><b>Personal information.</b> Tahometer uses your personally identifiable information for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and improve our service, features and content</li>
    <li>To administer our services, including verifying your authority to access Tahometer</li>
    <li>To provide you with customer support</li>
    <li>To fulfill any requests you may have</li>
    <li>To customize your experience</li>
    <li>To offer software updates and product announcements</li>
    <li>To give you further information about us</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The data we collect regularly about visitors to our website (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages access, duration of visit, etc.) does not necessarily enable us to personally identify you, and that is never our intention. When you sign up as a Tahometer user, however, you do provide us with your name, email and time zone information. Any additional information you provide to Tahometer when using our service is completely optional.</p>
  <p><b>Content.</b> One of the main reasons people use Tahometer is to share their work activity with others. This is the extent of the information we collect when you willingly choose to interact with Tahometer.</p>
  <p><b>Site activity information.</b> We keep track of the actions you take on Tahometer, such as website navigation, creating or editing items and authorizing an application. We also collect the browser version and the version of Tahometer you are currently using.</p>
  <p>When you access Tahometer's service from within our application, we may collect information received from that agent as well as your IP address and a list containing the functions you have used.</p>
  <p><b>Cookie information.</b> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer) to make Tahometer easier to use and protect both you and our service. For example, we can use cookies to store your login ID (but never your password) so as to make it easier for you to login whenever you return to Tahometer. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Tahometer and to know when you are interacting with our application and websites. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser at any time, but in some instances, this may impact your ability to use Tahometer.</p>

  <h1>How We Use Your Information</h1>
  <p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient and customized experience. Here are a few more details on how we do this:</p>
  <p><b>To manage our service.</b> The information we gather allows us to enable Tahometer's services and features, to analyze and improve its overall performance and to provide you with customer support. We also use the gathered data to prevent potentially illegal activities. This is done through a variety of technological systems that can detect and address anomalous activity. As a result of these efforts, a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions may at times occur, as well as that of some users or user locations.</p>
  <p><b>To contact you. From time to time, </b> we may contact you with service-related announcements. You may opt out of all communications except receiving essential updates on your account notifications page. If you do wish to do this, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the messages sent to you, or update your profile information. Note that we may include content you have shared on Tahometer in the emails we send to you.</p>
  <p>To run our software. Some downloadable applications we offer, including our Tahometer Agent, rely substantially on transmitting data to us. As a result, we may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection and use of information pertain to the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive desktop screenshots, titles of active windows and the amount of mouse clicks and pressed keys during certain periods of time. If we find it  not to be immediately obvious that we are collecting or using certain types of information, we will make a disclosure to you the very first time you provide us with the relevant data, so you can then decide whether or not to use that feature.</p>

  <h1>When We Share Information</h1>
  <p>While Tahometer does depend heavily upon sharing your information with others, we provide you with helpful privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing your information. We share your information with third parties only when we believe this has been authorized by you, when it is reasonably necessary to offer you our services or when we are legally required to do so. For example:</p>
  <p><b>When you make a payment.</b> Whenever you enter into a transaction or make payments on Tahometer, we will only share payment information with the agencies required to complete the transaction and will demand that all relevant third parties agree to respect the privacy of your information.</p>
  <p><b>When we aim to improve or promote our service.</b> Sometimes, we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. This, however, is only done  in such a way that no individual user can ever be identified or linked to any specific action or information.</p>
  <p><b>When we provide you with services.</b> We may disclose information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about Tahometer and process payments. These service providers may have access to your personal information for a limited time, but whenever this occurs, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections that limit their use of your data to helping us provide the service.</p>
  <p><b>When we offer joint services.</b> We may provide services in partnership with other companies. If you choose to use these services, we may share your information in order to facilitate the arrangement. However, we will always identify the partner and present you with their relevant privacy policy before you can begin using their service.</p>
  <p><b>When we respond to legal requests.</b> We may disclose information as a result of subpoenas, court orders or other official requests (including criminal and civil matters).</p>
  <p><b>In the event of sale or change of control.</b> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so the service can continue to operate. In any such case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h1>How We Protect Information</h1>
  <p>We do our best to keep your information secure, but we welcome your assistance in this matter.</p>
  <p><b>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</b> Tahometer keeps your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. Whenever you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt the data using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior. In response to signs of abuse, we may limit the use of site features, remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content and even suspend or disable accounts.</p>
  <p><b>Risks inherent in sharing information.</b> Although we allow you to set your own privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information, nor can we guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We also cannot ensure that information you share on Tahometer will not become publicly available and are not responsible for third-party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Tahometer. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices, such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services and keeping up-to-date antivirus software.</p>
  <p><b>Reporting violations.</b> Please help us by reporting any security violations using the feedback link on the left of the main page.</p>

  <h1>Account Deactivation</h1>
  <p>If you want to stop using your account, you may deactivate it. When you deactivate an account, although no user will be able to see your profile, it will not be permanently deleted. We keep your profile information saved in case you later decide to reactivate your account, as many users only leave Tahometer  on a temporary basis. Consequently, you will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety.</p>

  <h1>Other Terms</h1>
  <p><b>Changes.</b> We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by publishing the updated version on this web page.</p>
  <p><b>Consent to collection and processing in the United States.</b> By using Tahometer, you consent to having your personal data processed by Tahometer.</p>
