					  <p>TAHADI GAMES, LTD. and its affiliate companies   (collectively “Tahadi”) respect the privacy of its on-line visitors and   recognize the importance of providing a secure environment for them. We   have adopted a company wide On-Line Privacy Policy that guides how we   collect, store, and use the information you provide us. This Privacy   Policy details how Tahadi safeguards the privacy of its on-line visitors   and does not apply to information that may be collected by Tahadi   off-line. Please note that when you link to other sites from a Tahadi   website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the   activities on, those other sites. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> This Privacy Policy will tell you:    What personal identifying information we may collect  What other types of information we may collect  How your personal information may be used  Who is collecting your information  With whom may your personal information be shared?  What choices you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of   your personal information  Whether we collect information from children  What cookies are and how we use them  What are internet protocol addresses  What to do if you want to correct or review your personal information  How secure your personal information is  What to do if you have a question or complaint.</p>
					  <p>&nbsp; </p>
					  <p> If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy   policy statement or policies, please contact our Privacy Policy   Administrator at privacy@tahadi.com.  What personal information is collected? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Tahadi only collects personal information on a voluntary basis. If an   on-line visitor submits information to Tahadi, it will usually take the   form of either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our on-line   stores, (2) product or account registration, or registration for   on-line game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4) message   boards, (5) warranty registrations, (6) contest registrations, (7) a   consumer complaint, (8) surveys, (9) customer service or technical   support, and/or (10) newsletters. Personal information collected may   include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address. We   do not require this information to use our products or gain access to   our sites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain features   that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters   unless such information is provided. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Visitors purchasing products or services through our on-line stores will   be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit   card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.  Please note that, depending on the Tahadi site that you are visiting,   many of the activities listed above may not be available and, as such,   personal information may not be collected.  What other types of information may we collect? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password   and/or to provide other, non-personal information such as your age, date   of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences; and, combine   such information with your personal information. In addition, your web   browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information   or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data   processing, etc.) to Tahadi. Tahadi may use this information to generate   aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such   information to advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, Tahadi may   use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of   hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes.  How do we use your personal information? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> The personal information you provide Tahadi will allow us to fulfill   your product or service order; alert you of new products or services,   features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service or   technical support questions or issues; and/or notify you of upgrade   opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers.   Tahadi may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a   Tahadi site with data from third parties. Tahadi may also provide your   personal information to other companies or organizations that offer   products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we   will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with   an opportunity to opt-out. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing,   profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and   services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and   serve our customers.  Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals   acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information   contained in job applicant’s resume) is not subject to the uses set   forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.  Who is collecting your information? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> When you are asked for information while on a Tahadi site, you are   sharing that information with Tahadi, its parent, and its various   affiliates and sister companies, unless specifically stated otherwise.   As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from any of   Tahadi’s affiliates. In addition, some services are provided in   conjunction with partner companies. If your personal information is   being collected by another company other than Tahadi, you will be   notified at the time the information is collected. If you do not want   your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of   information by not using that particular service or by not providing any   information at that time. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties   to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they   adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Tahadi. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to our sites may   collect personal information about you. And remember, this Privacy   Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those   other advertisers or websites.  With whom may your personal information be shared? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Tahadi may need to disclose your personal information to third party   vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to   process, analyze, and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that   these entities do not use your personal information for any other   purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality,   security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required   by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that   disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring   legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or   Use Agreements for a Tahadi site or product, or may be causing injury to   or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with Tahadi’s rights   or property, other users of a Tahadi site or product, or anyone else   who could be harmed by your activities. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of   Tahadi and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we   may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we   decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can   continue to receive service and information in connection with that line   of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the   event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other   similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Tahadi ’s   successor or assign. </p>
					  <p> Tahadi sites may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where users   can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a   message board or chat area, please be aware that the information is   being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her   own risk.  What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution   of my personal information? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Tahadi allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying   information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal   information, Tahadi may give you the option of declining any future   offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In   addition, many of the “mailings” Tahadi may send you, such as   newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any   future mailings. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Note to Parents    We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about   young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give   out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission,   when on-line. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12   should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us   if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.  What are cookies and how do you use them? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to   transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping   purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to “remember”   things like your password, or that you have already registered. This   allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would   normally spend entering information such as your password or   registration. In addition, Tahadi may use cookies to retrieve user   information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.  What are Internet protocol addresses? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> An Internet protocol (”IP”) address is the unique number assigned to   your server or Internet Service Provider (”ISP”). Tahadi may track such   IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information,   site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being   abused.  What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your   personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete   such personal information, please contact Registration and Membership   Group, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at Dubai Internet City,   P.O. Box 500074, Dubai, U.A.E. You can also contact us by e-mailing us   at membership@tahadi.com.  Please note that the deletion of your data will lead to the termination   of your account and applicable services.  How secure is my personal information? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> Tahadi has taken steps to assure that all information collected will   remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration.   As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When   credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry   standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In addition, we will   take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer   any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.  What if I have a question or complaint? </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free   to e-mail us at membership@tahadi.com. </p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p> By using this Website, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy.   If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use this site.   This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back   periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.
