<p class="text">We take your privacy very seriously. It is important that you 
know what information TACNet Ltd (known here as 'we') collect and how we use it.</p>
<p class="text">By visiting our website(s) and completing any of the consent 
processes (i.e. subscribing to a service and/or providing your contact 
information), you accept and consent to the practices defined in this privacy 
policy.</p>
<h2>What <span>Information</span> we collect</h2>
<p class="text">We collect information when you join one of our website(s). 
Typically this includes your name, email address, IP address, username, password 
and whether the transaction with our billing processor was successful or was 
declined. We do NOT store your credit card or address details.</p>

<p class="text">When someone visits our websites we use a third party service, 
Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of 
visitor behavior patterns. This tells us how many visitors come to the various 
parts of the website. The method of processing this information does not enable 
Google Analytics to indentify anyone and we do not permit Google to try and find 
out the identities of visitors to our site.<br>
<br>
Google Analytics only provides us with generalised 'quantity' information such 
as how people visit each page on the website and how long they stay on a page. 
This information allows us to keep our website relevant and appealing to all 
customer and visitors.</p>
