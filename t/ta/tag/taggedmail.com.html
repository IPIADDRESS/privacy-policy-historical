If Member is a California resident, Member waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</td></tr>

<tr><td>Tagged is a fun website for teenagers that lets you refer your friends to sign up and join each others' Tag Teams. Like any website that offers a service where you register and provide information about yourself or your opinions, it is wise to pay attention to your personal information. At Tagged we understand this, and have established this Privacy Policy to explain how information is collected on our website, and how this information is used. 
Members Must Be Between 13 and 19 Years of Age. Tagged is intended solely for use by persons 13 to 19 years of age. All persons under 13 or over 19 years of age are prohibited from registering on Tagged.  An account created by a person between the ages of 13 and 19 will not be terminated once that person turns 20, however new accounts may not be created by this person at the age of 20.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>How Does Tagged Protect Children’s Privacy?</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td height="10"></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us.
<br><br>
Tagged is a general audience web site that complies with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  Our registration process is designed to
restrict children under the age of 13 from becoming members of Tagged and using
our site. We've also designed the tone and style of the site to appeal to
teenagers only (ages 13-19).  If we receive information suggesting that a user
who has registered with Tagged is under the age of 13, we require the user to
provide evidence confirming that the user is at least 13 years old.  If the user
fails to provide such information within 48 hours, we immediately terminate the
user’s account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying on
the site and collected from such user.

<tr><td height="10"></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>What Is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td height="10"></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that commercial
web sites obtain parental consent (under most circumstances) prior to the
collection of any personally identifiable information from children whom they
know to be under the age of 13. In addition, COPPA requires that web sites that
collect personal information from children under the age of 13 provide parents with:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Notice. Parents must be provided notice regarding what information is
collected, how the information will be used, and with whom the information may
be shared. 
</li><li>The ability to prevent further use of the information collected about the
child and prevent any future collection of personal information from the child. 
</li><li>The ability to access and review their child's personal information.
</li></ul>
COPPA also limits the amount of personal information a web site can collect from
a child. Web sites may not collect any more personal information than is
necessary to participate in a given game or activity.
<br><br> 
For more information about COPPA, please visit the <a class="or" href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission's
web site</a>.
<br><br> 
Parents:  If your child is under the age of 13 and has joined Tagged using a
false age, please notify Tagged Tagged Site &amp; Safety Squad at <a class="or" href="mailto:SiteSquad@Tagged.com">SiteSquad@Tagged.com</a>, and we
will immediately cancel your child's account and nullify all personally
identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from them.  If you
would like to know more about our site, information practices, stored
information about your child, or how to close your child's account, please
contact Tagged Tagged Site &amp; Safety Squad at <a class="or" href="mailto:SiteSquad@Tagged.com">SiteSquad@Tagged.com</a>. We will happily respond to all email from 
parents with Privacy questions or concerns.

<tr><td height="10"></td></tr>
<tr><td>
All users begin using Tagged's services by registering on the Tagged website. 
When registering, users provide personally identifiable information, which includes their first and last name, 
email address, mailing address, which school they attend, a user-chosen password, and data of birth, and other personal information. During registration, 
users also complete survey questions that provide information that is helpful for us to understand the demographics and consumer behavior of our users, 
such as identifying the users' eye color, style, personality type, favorite color, sport, food, activity or TV show, post-graduation plans or graduation year. 
Users are also asked to select "Tags" related to their talents, or complete a questionnaire for their online profile, which includes a variety of questions about the user's 
interests. Users may also provide journal entries to an online journal. To complete the registration process, Tagged sends a validation email message to each user, 
with a URL link back to our website. This URL contains an alphanumeric identifier and a user-specific numeric passcode that allows us to confirm the user's identity.

<tr><td height="10"></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tagged logs standard user information and clickstream data for all users, including a user's IP address, operating system, and page views. When users visit particular pages within Tagged, a UserID may be placed in the URL, allowing customized features for the user. Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering Tagged might place personally identifiable information within a user's URL during a visit to their website, and Tagged has no control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by a subsequent website that collects URL information.
In addition to the standard log information, Tagged uses a variety of technologies to create a more personalized experience for its users. Cookies are small data files sent by websites to a user's browser and hard drive that identify the computer to the website. We use cookies to allow enhanced features, such as allowing registered users to bypass typing their passwords before entering the website. We may also use cookies to enable customizable content for users, as they become available. Users have the option, within their Internet browsers, to disable cookies and continue to access the Tagged website.
Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages. We use pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send to our registered users. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may read cookies. 
Tagged web pages may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded services as they become available. Tagged pixel tags collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. Tagged web pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party ad servers, to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td height="10"></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Tagged uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes of the Tagged website, the Tagged referral and Tag Team building. 
We also use email addresses to send useful information to all registered users regarding the Tagged website. For example, we use email addresses of users, 
and of those persons provided on their referral lists, to send an invitation to the referred friend and encourage them to sign up on Tagged. When a user lists an 
email address on the referral page, an email is automatically sent from that registered user to the referral address, encouraging the referral to sign up on the Tagged website. 
If the referred person does not sign up within a few days, we also send a reminder from the registered user to the referral address. 
All registered users will be able to view other users Stats, Profiles, Journals and Tag Team pages, which may include personal information and responses to survey questions. 
If a registered user refers a friend who goes on to sign up on our site, then the registered user earns points. For more information about the point system, 
see <a href="http://www.tagged.com/huh.html">http://www.tagged.com/huh.html</a>. Tagged does not share the email address of any registered user with third parties unless the user specifically requests and authorizes 
that the user's email address be provided to such third party in order to receive information or participate in an offer. Tagged does not, however, sell or market the 
personally identifiable information of any unregistered user to or with any third party.
