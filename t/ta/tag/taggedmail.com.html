<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<p class="updated_date">Updated as of September 28, 2010</p>
<br>
<p>Please read the following important Terms of Service Agreement (the

"Services") made available to you (the "Member") by Tagged through <a href="/">http://www.tagged.com</a> ("Tagged"). ONLY USERS WHO ARE 13
YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER MAY REGISTER FOR TAGGED. By completing the

Agreement. If you are a minor, your parent or guardian must read and
accept the terms of this Agreement before you register. No Member may
participate where doing so would be prohibited by any applicable law or
regulation.</p>
<h3>A) Modifications</h3>
<p>Tagged reserves the right to modify or amend this Agreement at any
time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, at Tagged's sole
discretion. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on

changes to this Agreement on the Tagged website, as a Member it is your

<p></p>
<h3>K) Disputes</h3>
<p>The Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
law provisions. You and Tagged agree to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County,
California to resolve any dispute arising out of the Agreement or the
Tagged Services. If there is a dispute between participants on this
site, or any third party, Tagged is under no obligation to become
involved. In the event that Member has a dispute with one or more
members, Member hereby releases Tagged, their officers, employees,
agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual
and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected
and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way
related to such disputes and / or our service. If Member is a California
resident, Member waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not
know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his
settlement with the debtor. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY
CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHER, EACH PARTY
HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF EITHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT IN THE
EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY
TRIAL PROVISION. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS SECTION IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE OTHER PARTY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<h3>L) Termination</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate use of the Tagged website or the Services
with or without cause at any time and effective immediately upon written
notice to the other party. Tagged may terminate with or without cause at
any time and effective immediately, at Tagged's sole discretion,
including but not limited to Member's failure to conform with these
terms and conditions of the Agreement. Tagged shall not be liable to
Member or any third party for termination of use of Tagged or the
Services. Member's right to use Tagged or the Services shall cease
immediately. Member shall have no right and Tagged will have no
obligation thereafter to forward any unread or unsent messages to Member
or any third party. Sections G-N shall survive termination of the
Agreement.</p>
<h3>M) DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES</h3>
<p>MEMBER AGREES THAT USE OF THE TAGGED WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES IS
ENTIRELY AT MEMBER'S OWN RISK. THE TAGGED WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES ARE

implied warranties.</p>
<h3>N) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TAGGED BE LIABLE ON ACCOUNT OF MEMBER'S
USE OR MISUSE OF THE TAGGED WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES, WHETHER THE DAMAGES
ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE TAGGED WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES, FROM
INABILITY TO USE THE TAGGED WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES, OR THE
INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, MODIFICATION, ALTERATION, OR TERMINATION OF
THE TAGGED WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES. SUCH LIMITATION SHALL ALSO APPLY
WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY REASON OF OTHER SERVICES OR PRODUCTS
RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TAGGED WEBSITE OR
THE SERVICES OR ANY LINKS ON THE TAGGED WEBSITE, AS WELL AS BY REASON OF
ANY INFORMATION OR ADVICE RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED IN CONNECTION

WEBSITE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW. In some jurisdiction, limitations of liability are not
permitted. In such jurisdictions, the foregoing limitation may not apply

<h3>O) Indemnification</h3>

affiliates, successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents, employees,
service providers, and suppliers harmless from any dispute which may

Agreement.</p>

be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
conflict of law provisions. If any provision of the Agreement is found

nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. Member
agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim

Tagged and governs your use of Tagged and the Services, superseding any
prior agreements between Member and Tagged. You also may be subject to
additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate
services, third-party content or third-party software. The failure of
Tagged to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement
shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The section
titles in the Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or
contractual effect.</p>

<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p class="updated_date">Updated as of June 30, 2010</p>
<h3>User Privacy</h3>
<p>Tagged is a fun website that lets you refer your friends to sign up
and communicate with each other. Like any website that offers a service
where you register and provide information about yourself or your
opinions, it is wise to pay attention to your personal information. At
Tagged we understand this, and have established this Privacy Policy to
explain how information is collected on our website, and how this
information is used. Members Must Be 13 years of age or older. Tagged is
intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons
under 13 are prohibited from registering on Tagged.</p>
<h3>How Does Tagged Protect Children's Privacy?</h3>
<p>The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us.</p>
<p>Tagged is a general audience web site that complies with the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our registration
process is designed to restrict children under the age of 13 from
becoming members of Tagged and using our site. We've also designed the
tone and style of the site to appeal to teenagers. If we receive
information suggesting that a user who has registered with Tagged is
under the age of 13, we require the user to provide evidence confirming
that the user is at least 13 years old. If the user fails to provide
such information within 48 hours, we immediately terminate the user's
account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying
on the site and collected from such user.</p>
<h3>What Is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?</h3>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that
commercial web sites obtain parental consent (under most circumstances)
prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information from
children whom they know to be under the age of 13. In addition, COPPA
requires that web sites that collect personal information from children
under the age of 13 provide parents with:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Notice. Parents must be provided notice regarding what information
  is collected, how the information will be used, and with whom the
  information may be shared.</li>
  <li>The ability to prevent further use of the information collected
  about the child and prevent any future collection of personal
  information from the child.</li>
  <li>The ability to access and review their child's personal
  information.</li>
</ul>
COPPA also limits the amount of personal information a web site can
collect from a child. Web sites may not collect any more personal
information than is necessary to participate in a given game or
activity.
<p></p>
<p>For more information about COPPA, please visit the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission's web site</a>.</p>
<p>Parents: If your child is under the age of 13 and has joined Tagged
using a false age, please notify Tagged Tagged Site &amp; Safety Squad
at <a href="mailto:SiteSquad@Tagged.com">SiteSquad@Tagged.com</a>, and
we will immediately cancel your child's account and nullify all
personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected
from them. If you would like to know more about our site, information

<h3>User Information Collected by Tagged</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable User Information</h3>
<p>All users begin using Tagged's services by registering on the Tagged
website. When registering, users provide personally identifiable
information, which includes their first and last name, email address,
mailing address, which school they attend, a user-chosen password, and
date of birth, and other personal information. During registration,
users also complete survey questions that provide information that is
helpful for us to understand the demographics and consumer behavior of
our users, such as identifying the users' eye color, style, personality
type, favorite color, sport, food, activity or TV show, post-graduation
plans or graduation year. Users are also asked to select "Tags" related
to their talents, or complete a questionnaire for their online profile,
which includes a variety of questions about the user's interests. Users
may also provide journal entries to an online journal. To complete the
registration process, Tagged sends a validation email message to each
user, with a URL link back to our website. This URL contains an
alphanumeric identifier and a user-specific numeric passcode that allows
us to confirm the user's identity.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</h3>
<p>Tagged logs standard user information and clickstream data for all
users, including a user's IP address, operating system, and page views.
When users visit particular pages within Tagged, a UserID may be placed
in the URL, allowing customized features for the user. Users should be
aware that other websites visited before entering Tagged might place
personally identifiable information within a user's URL during a visit
to their website, and Tagged has no control over such websites.
Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by a subsequent
website that collects URL information. In addition to the standard log
information, Tagged uses a variety of technologies to create a more
personalized experience for its users. Cookies are small data files sent
by websites to a user's browser and hard drive that identify the
computer to the website. We use cookies to allow enhanced features, such
as allowing registered users to bypass typing their passwords before
entering the website. We may also use cookies to enable customizable
content for users, as they become available. Users have the option,
within their Internet browsers, to disable cookies and continue to
access the Tagged website. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are
included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages. We use pixel tags to gather
information about the e-mails we send to our registered users. When such
a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's
computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows
us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail
address, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may
read cookies. Tagged web pages may also contain similar pixel tags that
allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile
aggregated statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded
services as they become available. Tagged pixel tags collect only a
limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a
page view, and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides.
Tagged web pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party
ad servers, to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising. We do not 
have access to, nor control over, advertisers' cookies or how they may be 
used. If you would like more information about advertisers' use of cookies, 
and about your option not to accept these cookies, please click 
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Document Retention Schedule</h3>
<p>All personal information collected by Tagged in connection with your
use of the Tagged website, including, without limitation, your name,
location, email address, pictures, friend connections, messages, comments,
login information, ip addresses and other data, will be stored by Tagged
indefinitely in a safe and secure manner.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Tagged Uses the User Information</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Tagged uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes
of the Tagged website, the Tagged referral and friend list building.
Personally identifiable information including members' pictures and
names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction on
Tagged. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new
friends to join Tagged and to add users to members' friends' networks.
To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the
service, Tagged allows users to search for other members using first and
last name, email address, location and schools where users may have
attended. We also use email addresses to send useful information to all
registered users regarding the Tagged website.For example, we use email
addresses of users, and of those persons provided on their referral
lists, to send an invitation to the referred friend and encourage them
to sign up on Tagged. When a user lists an email address on the referral
page, an email is automatically sent from that registered user to the
referral address, encouraging the referral to sign up on the Tagged
website. If the referred person does not sign up within a few days, we
also send a reminder from the registered user to the referral address.
All registered users will be able to view other users Stats, Profiles,
Journals and friend list pages, which may include personal information
and responses to survey questions.
From time to time, Tagged may share the email address and/or other
personally identifiable information of any registered user with third
parties for marketing purposes. In addition, Tagged may share a
registered user's email address with third parties to target advertising
and to improve user experience on Tagged's pages in general.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</h3>
<p>Tagged uses cookie, IP address, clickstream and URL information to
improve the content of the Tagged website, the quality of Tagged
servers, and to provide enhanced features to users, where available. We
use cookies to save UserIDs, session validators, and on users' browsers
and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored products or
services to those users, as they become available. We also cross-match
user information with information collected from cookies and clickstream
data in order to test features of the Tagged website, and to better
personalize our various offerings for users. IP Addresses also help us
to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Tagged site, and
to otherwise provide the Tagged service to its users. IP addresses may
be disclosed to a third party if we believe in good faith that the law
or legal process so requires, or to protect the rights or property of
Tagged or others. From time to time we may extend various offers from
various partner companies, including news or additional details on
products and services. A user's usage history may result in specifically
tailored special offer screens or products. We may also produce
aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we may report to
advertisers the number of users who clicked on an ad, or the number of
users that visited different portions of the Tagged website. This
information will not include personally identifiable information about a
user, or a specific user's online usage patterns.</p>
<h3>Profile Information</h3>
<p>Tagged allows Members to provide information to a profile and/or
journal entries that is accessible to other users. We use this profile
information for the purposes of providing our services to you, such as
to analyze demographics, to better personalize our various offerings for
users, or to enable other users to find your profile. All information,
including any personally identifiable information, which is disclosed by
users in his or her public profile and journal entries are available for
others to see. Please do not post direct contact information in either
your profile or your journal, such as your email addresses, URLs,
instant messenger IDs, phone numbers, full names, or addresses. We also
caution you not to share sensitive information (such as social security
numbers, credit card numbers, and driver's license numbers) with other
users whom you do not know or place such information in your profile.</p>
<h3>Invitations</h3>
<p>The Invite Friends feature is an easy way for Tagged users to invite
friends through email. The email address(es) that you supply to use this
service will only be used to send invitations to connect with you on
Tagged.</p>
<h3>Surveys and Contests</h3>
<p>At various times we may offer surveys or contests to users. Surveys
may ask for contact, demographic or unique identifying information to
increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact
information or other demographic or personally identifiable information
in order to determine eligibility. Tagged may use information collected
from surveys and contests for the entertainment of users, and to
determine, notify and contact winners of various contests. In addition,
users' demographic and/or personally identifiable information and
responses to survey and contest questions may be used by Tagged and/or
shared with third parties in order to provide specifically tailored
special offers or advertisements. Tagged will not share a user's email
address with third parties unless the user specifically opts-in to such
sharing during the completion of or registration for a survey or
contest.</p>
<h3>Third Party Links and Ad Servers</h3>
<p>Please be aware that links to third party websites and third-party ad
server advertisements that are found on Tagged may, or may not, use
cookies, pixel tags and web tags. Tagged may provide links to third
party websites, which may, or may not, use cookies, pixel tags and web
tags. Ad servers may also use these tools to compile information about
where users saw particular advertisements, and to determine which ads
were clicked on. We are not responsible for, or have any control over,
the privacy policies of those third party websites and ad servers, and
encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every
website visited when linking directly from Tagged.</p>
<h3>Protection of Tagged and Others</h3>
<p>Tagged may disclose personally identifiable user information if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court
orders, or other legal process. Tagged may also disclose information
about its users to law enforcement officers or others, in the good faith
belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our <a href="#terms_of_service">Terms of Service</a>; respond to claims that
any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties; or
protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Tagged, its users or
the general public.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Tagged uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we
make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Tagged
website in a secure operating environment that is not available to the
public, we cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we make
every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and
systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.</p>
