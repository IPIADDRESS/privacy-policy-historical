</ul>
<p>I.	WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? <br> <br> We collect two kinds of   information related to you: (a) Personally  Identifiable Information   ("PII"); and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable  Information ("Non-PII").     <br> <br> (a) Personally Identifiable Information:  PII includes any   information  that identifies you as person.  We collect your PII when   you choose to  register with us or when you choose to participate in an   interactive  feature of our Site such as a review, survey or promotion.    You may: (a)  provide your name, mail/shipping address, email  address,  credit card  number and phone number when registering with our  Site,  making a  purchase, or in connection with a contest entry; (b)  provide  certain  demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender,  shopping  interests  and preferences, etc.) when participating in a  survey or  poll; or (c)  post a general comment and/or recommendation on  our Site.    <br> <br> (b)  Non-Personally Identifiable Information:   Non-PII is  any  information that does not identify you as a person  including PII  which  has been rendered anonymous.  We obtain non-PII  either separately  or  together with your PII as described above.   We  collect certain  non-PII  from you when you access our Site including IP  addresses and  information  relating to your browser, operating system,  ISP, the third  party  website from which your visit originated and how  you use our Site  such  as the web pages you visit, and the duration of  your visits.  <br> <br> II.	HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED  <br> <br> PII and Non-PII is used to provide, or improve, our Site and Services   to  you and to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries,   better  serve you and understand your needs, or is used in other ways   naturally  associated with the circumstances in which you provided the   information.     <br> <br> We may disclose PII and Non-PII to: <br> <br> (1) any merchant you buy Products from using our Site; <br> <br> (2) our third party service providers who perform functions on our    behalf in connection with the operation of the Site or Services - e.g.,    providers who host and manage data, process credit card orders,  deliver   our merchandise, etc;   <br> <br> (3) participating sponsors to a program or promotion you enter through our Site or Services;  <br> <br> (4) our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies    ("affiliated companies") for operational, marketing and promotional    purposes;  <br> <br> (5) co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships; <br> <br> (6) participating merchants where you consent at the time you submit   PII  to us when using the interactive features of our Site such as   surveys  and reviews concerning our participating merchants; and <br> <br> (7) our other users where you choose to publicly post reviews, comments    or other information relating to products or services, communicate   with  other users via public forums (e.g., forums, message boards,   bulletin  boards, etc.). <br> <br> In addition, we use non-PII to help   analyze site traffic, understand  customer needs and trends, carry out   targeted promotional activities  (see "Preference Based Advertising"   below).  We may use your non-PII by  itself or aggregate it with   information we have obtained from others to  produce research reports   and other information and data about online  shopping for participating   merchants and other customers, as well as  media and other interested   parties.  <br> <br> III.	COOKIES AND PREFERENCE BASED ADVERTISING <br> <br> (a) Cookies and Web Beacons: We automatically receive and store certain    types of non-PII whenever you interact with us by using "cookies" and    analogous technology.  "Cookies" are small files that we place on  your   computer or your Web browser memory to enable our systems to  recognize   your browser and to provide convenience and other features  to you.  It   is important to note that the cookies that we use do not  contain and  are  not tied to PII about you.  <br> <br> You may be able  to direct  your internet browser not to allow cookies and  you can  delete existing  cookies from your computer. Please note,  however, some  elements of our  Site will not function properly or be  available to  you.  <br> <br> (b)   Preference Based Advertising: We work with third  parties, including   advertising companies and website analysis firms,  who use cookies to   collect non-PII when you visit our Site and third  party sites about your   surfing activities. This non-PII, collected  through cookies, is   typically used by these third party advertising  networks to serve you   with advertisements while on third party sites  tailored to meet your   preferences and likely interests.   If you do  not wish to participate in   this activity, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click here</a> and follow the simple opt-out process. <br> <br> A couple of important notes about this opt-out tool: (1) it includes   all  the advertising networks that TaDa works with, but also many that   TaDa  does not work with; and (2) it relies on cookies to ensure that a   given  advertising network does not collect information about you   ("Opt-out  Cookies") . for a general explanation of how Opt-out Cookies   work,  please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/opting_out.aspx" target="_blank">click here</a> .   Therefore, if you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete    these Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to perform  the   opt-out task again. <br> <br> IV.	SALE OF BUSINESS AND DISCLOSURE BY LAW  <br> <br> (a) Business Transactions: We may disclose PII and Non-PII held by us:    (a) to a prospective seller or actual seller of any business or assets    we acquire;  (b) if all or any of our assets are acquired by a third    party, in which case, PII and Non-PII may be one of the transferred    assets.    <br> <br> (b)  Required disclosures: We may disclose and use   any PII or non-PII if  we are required to do so by law, with respect to   copyright and other  intellectual property infringement claims, or if  we  believe that such  action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government   request; (b) conform  with the requirements of the law or legal  process;  (c) protect or defend  our legal rights or property, our Site,  or other  users; or (d) in an  emergency to protect the health and  safety of our  Site's users or the  general public. <br> <br> V.	SECURITY OF INFORMATION <br> <br> We work to protect the security of your information during transmission    by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts   information  you input. We also use a secure server hosting location in   the US,  firewall protection, controlled access and encryption   technology to  protect your data.  Please be advised, however, that   while we strive to  protect your PII, we cannot guarantee or warrant the   security of any  information you disclose or transmit to us online and   are not  responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent   disclosure of  your PII.  In the unfortunate event that your personally   identifiable  information is compromised, we will notify you by e-mail   to the last  e-mail address you have provided us as soon as feasible   under the  circumstances (delays in notification may occur while we take   necessary  measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore   reasonable  integrity to the system, as well as for the legitimate needs   of law  enforcement if notification would impede a criminal   investigation). <br> <br> VI.	YOUR OPTIONS &amp; OPT-OUTS <br> <br> (a)   What Information Can I Access?  If you register as a TaDa member,  you   will typically have access to an account section that includes the    registration information you previously provided.  If there is any    inaccurate information, just let us know.  Also, if you wish, you can    delete your membership account entirely although we may retain certain    information in limited circumstances . e.g., to resolve disputes,    troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms  of Use. Furthermore, some   information is never completely removed from  our databases due to   technical (e.g., information that is stored in our  "back-up" systems)   and certain legal constraints.  <br> <br> (b) What Choices Do I Have   (Opt-Out)?  You have many choices regarding  how we use information   about you, including: (1) To stop our emails, <a href="http://about.shopzilla.com/contact-us/site-questions" target="_blank">click here</a> ; (2) To opt-out of third party advertising, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click here</a> ; (3) To stop the sharing of PII with our participating merchants, <a href="http://about.shopzilla.com/contact-us/site-questions" target="_blank">click here</a> - note that this opt-out does not apply to the information we share    with a merchant from whom you have purchased Products from via our Site;    and (4) as discussed above, the choices we offer you anytime you   submit  information through our Site or Services.  <br> <br> (c) You May Contact Us With Questions: If you have any questions or concerns about privacy at TaDa, please contact us by <a href="http://about.shopzilla.com/contact-us/site-questions" target="_blank">clicking here</a> .  <br> You may also contact us by calling 1(877)LUV-TADA (588-8232) or by writing to:</p>
