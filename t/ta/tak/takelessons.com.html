    <h5 class="Plain">Last revised: August 2013</h5>
  </header>

  <section class="ContentSpacer50">
    <p>
      Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience
      with us as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use
      TakeLessons.com (the “Website”) and all of our services with complete
      confidence. We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our
      commitment to privacy and security and supplement our
      <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
    </p>

    <p>We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

    <hr class="BreakFirst BreakLast">

    <section>
      <header class="PageDesc">
        <h3>Personal Information We Collect and How It Is Used</h3>
      </header>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
       This Privacy Policy describes how we collect information from users of
       our Website, those who use our products and services (the “Services”) but
       do not have accounts ("Visitors"), and those who register and subscribe
       to our services ("Members"). It describes what we do with the information
       we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the
       collection and use of such information.
      </p>

      <h4>Types of Information We Collect</h4>
      <p>
        We collect information from Visitors and Members who access various
        parts of our Website and use different Services in a variety of ways,
        including through a mobile device. As a result, the type of information
        we collect depends on the ways Visitors and Members interact with us,
        our Website and/or our Service(s). We may offer websites, services or
        applications that permit browsing and do not require registration. We
        may also offer Members the ability to access their accounts online and
        offline, which may result in collection of different data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information that we may collect about you through interactions includes
        information that you give us (such as your name, address, email
        address, other contact information, surveys and other information input
        into the Website); automatic information (data resulting from your
        activity, such as transaction information, IP address, log in, email,
        passwords and browsing activity); mobile information (location
        services); and information from other sources. We may also gather
        additional information such as the type of device and browser you are
        using, the IP address of your device, information about your device's
        operating system, and additional information associated with your
        device and browsing activity. We may also gather information collected
        through cookies, tags, and other technologies, as described further
        below.
      </p>

      <h4>Use of Registration and Visitor Information</h4>
      <p>
        Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign
        up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, email
        address and billing information (such as a credit card number and
        expiration date). The personal information collected from Members during
        the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such
        as for billing purposes) <strong>and may be shared with other members to
        coordinate service delivery</strong>. This information is not normally
        shared with unaffiliated third parties, unless specifically stated
        otherwise or in special circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
        behalf. They have access to personal information gathered through the
        Services needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
        purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may promote the Website, Services or a new service to members. You
        may manage your communication preferences within your account.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from
        personal information Members provide during registration (such as the
        total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more
        detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying
        information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.
      </p>

      <h4>Email Marketing from Third Party Sponsors</h4>
      <p>
        We may send, on behalf of third parties, promotions via mail to some or
        all of our Members. However, in no event do we sell or otherwise
        transfer to third parties the email addresses of our subscribers. We
        strictly maintain the confidentiality of our subscribers' email
        addresses, except as stated in this Privacy Policy. In addition, users
        are always given the opportunity of opting-out of these promotions.
      </p>

      <h4>Voluntary Customer Surveys</h4>
      <p>
        We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer
        surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys
        because they provide us with important information that helps us to
        improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you.
        Your personal information and responses will remain strictly
        confidential (except where required by law), even if a third party
        conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.
      </p>

      <p>
        We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our
        Customer Surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other
        customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions
        (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment,
        industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the
        aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you,
        and to develop new services and products. This aggregated,
        non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties.
      </p>

      <h4>"Cookies" and How We Use Them</h4>
      <p>
        A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive
        when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to collect, store,
        and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the
        products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications
        networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your
        settings (which saves you time) and to provide customizable and
        personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to
        access any of your customer information. Advertisers and partners may
        also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies
        and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through
        them. We may also provide certain widgets or tools on our sites, such as
        tools that allow web surfers to easily share information on another
        platform, such as a social media platform. At other times, information
        from a third party may be embedded on our site, such as a map or
        information streaming from another site, including communications
        streaming from a third party social media platform. These widgets,
        tools, and informational items often function through the use of third
        party cookies utilized by the third party site, such as the social
        media platform. You may wish to review information at third party
        sites, such as social media platforms where you have an account, to
        determine how these third parties treat data that they obtain through
        the use of cookies.
      </p>

      <h4>Additional Technologies</h4>
      <p>
        We may also use additional technologies such as pixel tags, web
        beacons, and clear GIFs, and may permit our third party service
        providers to use these technologies. We use these technologies for
        purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements or
        other communications, determining viewing and response rates, and
        determining which offers to present to you on our own or on third party
        sites.
      </p>

      <h4>In the Event of a Change in Ownership</h4>
      <p>
        As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy websites,
        subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer
        information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
        remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice
        (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger or an acquisition,
        all (or select aspects) of our customer information may be transferred.
        All of our subscribers and registered users will be notified of any
        change in ownership, merger or an acquisition of our assets by a third
        party. Subscribers and users may choose to access and modify any of
        their registration and subscription information at that time.
      </p>

      <h4>Special Cases</h4>
      <p>
        It is our policy not to use or share personal information about
        Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above
        without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise
        prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal
        information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your
        use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for
        any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable
        to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic
        Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal
        requests for such information; to disclose information that is
        necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone
        who may be violating our
        <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> or other policies; to
        operate the Services properly; or to protect us and our Members. This
        includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
        for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

      </header>
      <h4>Your Credit Card Information is Secure</h4>
      <p>
        We are committed to handling your customer information with high
        standards of information security. Your credit card information is

        proper clearance who need to know that information in order to provide
        products or services to you. While we make every effort to ensure the
        integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee
        that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from

      <h4>What is your Credit Card Fraud Policy?</h4>
      <p>
        In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your
        credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit
        card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you are only liable
        for the first $50 of the fraudulent charges. Please check with your
        credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions.

        <h3>Communication to Members and Visitors</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        We use personal information to communicate important information with
        our Members. Important information includes, but not limited to,
        student newsletters, instructor newsletters, lesson reminders, lesson
        comments, payment information, credit card update notifications,
        account status, legal updates, and other important account
        information. Members and, where applicable Visitors, agree to accept
        this communication from us.
      </p>

      <h4>Online Advertisements</h4>
      <p>
        We occasionally display online advertisements on our Website and in
        our newsletters and alerts. We share aggregated and non-identifying
        information about our Visitors and Members collected through the
        registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions
        with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this
        aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored
        advertisements. For instance, an advertiser might tell us the
        audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55
        years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to that
        audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we
        have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended
        audience. However, we do not share personal information about Visitors
        or Members with these advertisers to be used for other purposes.
      </p>

      <h4>Responses to Email Inquiries</h4>
      <p>
        When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to us, we use the return
        email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. We do not use
        the return email address for any other purpose and do not share the
        return email address with any third party.
      </p>

      <h4>Our Commitment to Data Security</h4>
      <p>
        Services and websites we sponsor have security measures in place to
        protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our
        control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and
        security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our
        security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally
        obtaining this information.
