However, you will not be able to suspend or postpone if we have already started preparing you next box of the Personalized Care/of Packs. You will be alerted by email when we start preparing your next box of Personalized Care/of Packs. \n\n9.\tINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nThe Website and the Services contain materials, such as software, text, graphics, images, sound recordings, audiovisual works, and other material provided by or on behalf of Noho Health (collectively referred to as the “Content”).

We make no claims concerning whether the Content may be downloaded, viewed, or be appropriate for use outside of the United States.  If you access the Website, the Services or the Content from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk.  Whether inside or outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction.\n\n17.\tTERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT\n\nWe reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate this Agreement and your access to all or any part of the Services, at any time and for any reason without prior notice or liability.  We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any part of the Services at any time without prior notice or liability.\n\n18.\tDIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT\n\nNoho Health respects the intellectual property rights of others and attempts to comply with all relevant laws. We will review all claims of copyright infringement received and remove any Content or user submissions deemed to have been posted or distributed in violation of any such laws.\n\nOur designated agent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “Act”) for the receipt of any Notification of Claimed Infringement which may be given under that Act is as follows:\n\nNoho Health LLC\nAttention: DMCA\n9 Great Jones St. #4 \nNew York, NY 10012 \n\nIf you believe that your work has been copied on the Website and/or the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our agent with notice in accordance with the requirements of the Act, including (i) a description of the copyrighted work that has been infringed and the specific location on the Website and/or the Services where such work is located; (ii) a description of the location of the original or an authorized copy of the copyrighted work; (iii) your address, telephone number and e-mail address; (iv) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; (v) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf; and (vi) an electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest.\n\n19.\tBINDING ARBITRATION\n\nIn the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Services or any other products or services provided by us (each, a “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”).  Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website http://www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent Noho Health from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect Noho Health’s proprietary interests.\n\n20.\tCLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\nYou agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS CUSTOMER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n\n21.\tMISCELLANEOUS  \n\nThis Agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the Termination provision above, such termination shall not affect the validity of the following provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect: “Subscription Fees, Payments and Automatic Renewals,” “Intellectual Property,” “Communications with Us,” “No Warranties; Limitation of Liability,” “Indemnification,” “Termination of the Agreement,” “Binding Arbitration,” “Class Action Waiver,” and “Miscellaneous.”\n \nOur failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement.  No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.  Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter.  The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import.  This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.  \n\nCopyright 2016 Noho Health LLC.

The Care/of Pre-launch Referral Program allows Care/of “Users”, defined as subscribers to our mailing list, to earn a promotion code for a free week, month, or year of vitamins and supplements at Care/of. Care/of will also donate prenatal vitamins to support women in need in an amount proportionate to the number of Users on our list at the close of the Pre-launch Referral Program. \n\nUsers earning promotion codes may only use them towards purchases made that are being shipped to addresses within the United States. \n\nTo participate, Care/of Users must agree to these terms outlined below.\n\n**How to Earn a Promotion Code for Free Vitamins and Supplements** \n\nCare/of Users can earn a promotion code towards future Care/of orders by reaching the milestones of total people referred by their link to our mailing list, determined by Care/of and outlined below. Each referred friend will only count towards a “milestone” if: \n\n1. referred friend clicks on their referral link;\n2. the referred friend enters a valid email (owned by that user) to sign up for our mailing list. \n3. the referred friend was not previously registered with Care/of under any email address or alias; and\n4. the referred friend is at least 18 years old.\n\nCare/of Users may not refer themselves using different email addresses. \n\nAfter the close of the program, Care/of reserves the right to assess the validity of email addresses referred to our mailing list and to disqualify certain email addresses from counting towards a referrer’s total referral count.  \n\nThe milestones to earn promotion codes for free vitamins and supplements are defined as follows:  \n- 3 referred friends: Promotion code for 1 free week of vitamins and supplements at Care/of. The promotion code will effectively reduce the cost of a vitamin subscription for one month by 25%, up to $15.00. \n- 10 referred friends: Promotion code for 1 free month of vitamins and supplements at Care/of. The promotion code will effectively reduce the cost of a vitamin subscription for one month by 100%, up to $60.00.\n- 100 referred friends: The promotion code will effectively reduce the cost of a vitamin subscription for 12 months by 100%, up to $720.00.\n\nA Care/of User may earn a promotion code for at most 1 year of vitamins and supplements at Care/of.  \n\nFor each 20 valid email addresses on the Care/of subscription list at the close of the Pre-launch Referral Program, Care/of will donate one month of prenatal vitamins to the [GOOD+ Foundation](http://goodplusfoundation.org/) to be distributed via its charitable partners. Care/of commits to a minimum donation of $20,000 (retail value) of prenatal vitamins. \n\n**Redeeming a promotion code at Care/of**\n\nCare/of Users will receive promotion codes they have earned on or after “launch date” (“launch date” is the day Care/of opens up for sale to the public). On or after launch date, a Care/of User must create a profile and select the vitamins and supplements they wish to receive in their pack, and complete their first purchase using the promotion code within 6 months from the “launch date”. After six months, the User’s promotion code will expire. Pre-launch earned promotion codes may not be combined with any other offers or promotions. Promotion codes may not be transferred or exchanged for any cash or money. Promotion codes can only be made for purchases that are being shipped to addresses within the United States.\n\nPromotion codes may not be earned by creating multiple Care/of Accounts. Total referrals accrued to multiple Care/of Users during the Pre-launch Referral Program may not be combined into one Care/of account.\n\nRewards are subject to verification. Care/of may delay a Reward for the purpose of investigation. We may also refuse to verify and process any transaction we deem, in our sole discretion, to be fraudulent, suspicious or in violation of these Terms and Conditions.\n\n**Sharing Referral Links**\n\nReferrals should only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes, and only shared with personal connections that will appreciate receiving these invitations. Referral links should not be published or distributed where there is no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the recipients are personal friends (such as coupon websites, Reddit, or Wikipedia).\n\n**Multiple Referrals**\n\nA referred friend may only use one referral link. If a referred friend receives referral links from multiple Care/of Users, only the corresponding Care/of User of the referral link used by the referred friend will receive credit towards a milestone.\n\n**Severability**\n\nIf any provision in these terms are held to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, such provision (or the part of it that is making it invalid, void or unenforceable) will be struck and not affect the validity of and enforceability of the remaining provisions.\n\n**Termination and Change**\n\nCare/of may suspend or terminate the Pre-launch Referral Program or a user’s ability to participate in the Pre-launch Referral Program at any time for any reason.\nWe reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove referral credits if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive or fraudulent. We reserve the right to review and investigate all referral activities and to suspend accounts or modify referrals as deemed fair and appropriate.\n\n**Transfer of Value of Rewards**\n\nPromotion codes earned through this program have no monetary value and may not be redeemed for cash. Promotion codes are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered or sold. Upon termination of the Care/of Pre-launch Referral Program or any portion thereof for any reason, any unredeemed Promotion codes accumulated by a user are forfeited. Care/of reserves the right to limit redemption of promotion codes.\n\n**General**\n\nOur failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement.  No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.
