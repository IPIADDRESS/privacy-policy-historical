            Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
        </h3>
        <p>
            We use cookies, clear GIFs, log files and other tracking mechanisms to collect information about your use of our Sites and Apps, as described above. We may
            combine this information with other personal information we collect from you. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You
            may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Cookies</strong>
            <br>
            Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies
            enable a faster log-in process, and some allow us to track your activities at our Sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer,
            you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to disable cookies or
            change your cookies settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies</strong>
            <br>
            Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs
            (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites to track the activities of visitors to our Sites, help us manage content, and
            compile statistics about usage of our Sites. We may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our clients, to help us track email response rates, identify when
            our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Third-Party Analytics</strong>
            <br>
            We also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites and the services we provide. We use these tools to
            gather non-personal information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These analytics providers may use cookies
            and other technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our Sites with other information that they
            have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Plug-ins and Social Media Widgets </h3>
        <p>
            Our Site may include social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook Like button and the "Share this" button, as well as other interactive
            mini-programs that run on our Site and Services and enable certain features to work (e.g., blogs and comments). These features may collect your IP address,
            which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly and for purposes. These features are displayed on
            our Site, but are hosted by third parties, and are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Your interactions with these features are governed
            by the privacy policy of the company providing them
        </p>
        <h3>
            Third-Party Ad Networks
        </h3>
        <p>
            We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to
            evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as
            well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be
            interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including
            clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party
            cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with
            information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and
            users of our service.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital
            Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this
            information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective
            websites: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/opt...</a> (NAI) and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (DAA).
        </p>
        <p>
            Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted
            content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example,
            based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you
            subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional
            information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.
        </p>
        <h3>

        </h3>
        <p>
            Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead
            is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Security of My Personal Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            We have implemented security measures to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
            destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

            What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?
        </h3>

            We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in
            the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about
            recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have requested or
            received from us.
