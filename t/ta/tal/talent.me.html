  <ul type="disc">
    <li>We do not share, rent, trade or       sell your personally identifiable information to third parties other than       as described within this privacy policy.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>This privacy policy covers&nbsp;<a href="https://talent.me" target="_blank">www.Talent.me</a> and Talent.me Facebook App accessed via <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/talentme">http://apps.facebook.com/talent.me</a> (hereinafter  collectively “Talent.me”). It does not, however, apply to entities that Talent.me  does not own or control. By using or accessing Talent.me, you agree to our  privacy practices outlined here.<br>
      <br>
    We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please  review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will  notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage. By  continuing to use the Talent.me after notice of changes have been sent to you  or published on the Talent.me, you are consenting to the changes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1. Personal Information Collected</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    The purpose of Talent.me is to permit Users to voluntarily provide information  about themselves for the purposes of developing, maintaining and enhancing a  network of professional contacts. You willingly provide us certain personal  information, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from Talent.me.  If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having  such information displayed on Talent.me or otherwise used in any manner  permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become  a member of the Talent.me community.<br>
  <br>
    We collect your personal information in the following ways:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Registration</strong><br>
    In order to become a User; you must first create an account on Talent.me using  Talent.me’s Facebook App. While creating an account using Facebook Connect, you  may be required to provide the following contact information, which you  recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others,  including Talent.me, to identify you: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal  code, a brief summary of your professional background, and a password chosen by  you. We may also collect other information that is visible on your Facebook  profile when permitted by Facebook's Terms of Use as well as additional  information that you chose to allow Facebook to provide to Talent.me during  registration process. This information may include, but is not limited to, your  name, your age, your e-mail address, the location of your computer or handheld  device, your profile picture, gender, and the pictures and names of your  Facebook "friends", as well as other basic information regarding your  Facebook "friends" that may be provided by Facebook to Talent.me.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Profile Information</strong><br>
    Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the Profile  section describing your talents, professional and educational experiences, and  networking objectives. You may also provide demographic information such as  age, gender, relationship status, interests/hobbies. You also have the ability  to upload photos. Please be aware that all users may view your photos.  Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration to  become a User is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself  and find new opportunities in the Talent.me system to build and leverage your  professional network. Any information you provide at registration or in the  Profile section that is not personally identifiable may be used in the same  manner and extent to which other information that is not personally  identifiable is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of  serving advertisements through the service. If you opt-out you may lose the  potential benefit of being a User, including receiving ads that are more  targeted to your interests.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Contacts Information</strong><br>
    We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends' addresses so  that you can find your friends on Talent.me, and invite your contacts that do  not have accounts to join. In order to invite others to connect with you  directly in Talent.me, you may use the Talent.me services to invite them if  they are a User, or enter their names and email addresses. This information  will be used by Talent.me to send your friend email invitations on your behalf  including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people  that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders. If you  give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your  password after you have uploaded your contacts' information.<br>
  <br>
    You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts into  the private “My contacts” section of Talent.me. All information that you enter  or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy  policy as cover your own information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
    Talent.me may collect information such as your name and email address through  the Talent.me website or through the Customer Service website in order to,  among other things, accurately categorize and respond to a customer's inquiry  and deliver appropriate service levels.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
    Like most websites, Talent.me uses cookies and web log files to track site  usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows  Talent.me to recognize you as a User when you return to the Talent.me website using  the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow  cookies, you will not be able to use the Talent.me website. Like the  information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file  data is used to customize your experience on our website.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
    One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you've logged  in to your Talent.me account. The next time you visit the Talent.me website,  the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User by  your email address and password, so you will not need to log in before using  the service. In order to access or change any of your private information (like  a credit card number), however, you must log in securely again with your  password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.</p>
  <p>Another type of cookie we utilize is a session  ID cookie. A session ID cookies is used to enable certain features of  Talent.me, to better understand how you interact with Talent.me and to monitor  aggregate usage by Talent.me Users and web traffic routing on Talent.me. Unlike  persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log  off from Talent.me and then close your browser.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
    We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User  preferences and tracking User trends. Most browsers are initially set up to  accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to  indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings  do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to  use the Talent.me. Talent.me does not store personally identifiable information  in the cookies.<br>
  <br>
    In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we  may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on  your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies  will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment  information, e.g. your industry or geographic location, your occupation, or  information about your professional or educational background, for greater  customization of your user experience. The use of cookies set by these third  parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control  over these cookies.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
    We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users.  Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors  and research firms. Talent.me may “target” some ads to Users that fit a certain  general profile - for example, “product managers in Texas.” Talent.me does NOT use personally  identifiable information to target ads.<br>
  <br>
    To deliver these ads properly, Talent.me may include a file, called a web  beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Talent.me so the networks  may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for  advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.<br>
  <br>
    Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from  the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own  cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.<br>
  <br>
    These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads  on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. Talent.me does  not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other  third party.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer</strong><br>
    Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit Talent.me we  automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to  which you are going when you leave Talent.me. We also receive the Internet  protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access  the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you  are using, email patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is  used to analyze overall trends to help us improve Talent.me. The linkage  between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not  shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by  law.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Consent to Talent.me Processing Information About You</strong><br>
    Certain information you provide to Talent.me may reveal, or allow others to  identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion or other aspects of your  private life, and more generally about you. Please be aware that in providing  information to Talent.me for the purposes of opening your user account, you are  expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy  Policy and Talent.me's User Agreement. The supplying of all such information by  you to Talent.me, including all information deemed “sensitive” by applicable  law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your  consent at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and  the User Agreement, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be  retroactive.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You</strong><br>
    You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data about you  which has been collected pursuant to your decision to become a User. If you  update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information which you  originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented herein.<br>
    We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to  be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us at <u><a href="mailto:legal@talent.me">legal@talent.me</a></u>&nbsp;or  contacting us at:<br>

  <strong>2. Uses of personal information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    Talent.me is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals to  tap into their friend’s social network and search for career opportunities. The  personally identifiable information you choose to provide on our website is  used to help you describe yourself to other Users, to send you newsletters, as  well as fulfill your order of a premium or sponsored membership. Other  information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is  collected by Talent.me from Users (such as, for example, patterns of  utilization) and is exclusively owned by Talent.me. This information can be  utilized by Talent.me in such manner as Talent.me, in its sole discretion,  deems appropriate.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Teaming with Other Organizations to Offer Combined and Other Services</strong><br>
    Talent.me may offer our services in connection with other websites (including  updates about the Talent.me service) or may team with marketing partners,  affiliated companies, and other online services to give you the combined  results of both services or additional services and benefits (“Partners”).<br>
  <br>
    We only work with trusted Partners. To report any suspected misuse of  information contact:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@talent.me">legal@Talent.me</a>. Talent.me is not  responsible for your use of or inability to use any services or products of  Partners, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of such applications and  their privacy practices.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Talent.me Communications</strong><br>
    Talent.me will communicate with you through email and notices posted on Talent.me  or through other means available via Facebook. These include a series of  welcome emails, which help inform new Users about various features of the  service. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from Talent.me  related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when  another User in your network endorses you on Talent.me.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
    Talent.me, and/or our Partners, may regularly send out newsletters, weekly  status emails, or promotional emails. Talent.me may send you promotional  information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. You can  change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by amending your email  notification choices. In newsletters and weekly status emails, Talent.me and/or  our Partner may inform you, among other things, about new features, about your  events in the upcoming week, about specific personal statistics from the  respective past calendar week (i.e. the number of hits on your Profile, whether  you have new contacts to be confirmed and/or new private messages, etc.), or  about education content. You may choose to unsubscribe from the newsletter at  any time by sending an email to the link provided at the end of each  newsletter.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Online Directory:</strong><br>
    We utilize an online directory so that users may find each other on our Web  site. Within our directory we will display your name and email address. Since  this directory is a major function of our Web site, if you do not want to be  part of the directory, you should not register on Talent.me.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Customized Content</strong><br>
    Information provided to Talent.me is also used to customize your experience on  our website. For example, when you login to your account we will display the  screen names of new Users who have recently joined your network.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
    Talent.me takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not share, sell,  rent, trade or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to  third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy. We will only  share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out  your instructions or to provide specific services or information. For instance,  we use a credit card processing company to bill Users for subscription fees.  These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable  information except to provide these services and they are bound by  confidentiality agreements, which limit their use of such information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Feedback.</strong><br>
    We use a third party service provider to host our feedback page. You may submit  contact information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or email  address, in connection with feedback, concerns, complaints, questions, or  technical support. Such information is used only to respond to those inquiries  and is governed by this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
    We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our services to third  parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be  appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on Talent.me. We may segment  our Users by role (i.e. product managers, vice presidents), industry,  geographic location, or company.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Surveys and Polls</strong><br>
    As a User, you will receive requests to participate in market research  including polls and surveys submitted by other Talent.me members. If you  participate in surveys and polls offered through our website, the information  you provide may be visible to others using Talent.me.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Forums/Chats/Blogs</strong><br>
    If you post a message or use a bulletin board on Talent.me, you should be aware  that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there can be  read, collected, or used by other Users of these forums, as well as third  parties, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Talent.me is not  responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in  these forums.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Testimonials and Advertisement Placed through Talent.me</strong><br>
    If you provide any testimonials about Talent.me or place advertisements through  Talent.me, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you  place in connection with Talent.me's promotion of its service to third parties,  which testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal  information that you have provided. We do obtain the clients consent prior to  posting their name along with their testimonial.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Communications to other Users</strong><br>
    Many emails you initiate through Talent.me, e.g., an invitation sent to a  non-User, may list your email address and name in the header of the  message.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
    It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required  by law, such as responses to civil or criminal subpoenas, or other requests by  law enforcement personnel. We will disclose such information wherein we have a  good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing  judicial proceeding, subpoena, or other legal process or request to Talent.me  brought in any country throughout the world, or to exercise our legal rights or  defend against legal claims.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Disclosures to others</strong><br>
    We may also disclose your personal and other information you provide, to  another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of a Talent.me  division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell Talent.me's  assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other  information that you provide to us. You will be notified via email or prominent  notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of  your personal information.<br>

    You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired  changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your Talent.me  account including your email, and contact preferences, at any time by logging  in to your account and accessing the “My Updates” section. Please be aware that  even after your request for a change is processed, Talent.me may, for a time,  retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of  its database.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Closing Your Account</strong><br>
    If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When  you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be  deleted. We save your profile information (friends, photos, interests, etc.) in  case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their  accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their  information until they return to Talent.me. You will still have the ability to  reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you  delete an account, it is permanently deleted. You should only delete your  account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. We may retain  certain data contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent  fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of  aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required  by law.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>4. Your Obligations</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    As a User, you have certain obligations toward the other Users with whom you  will be communicating. Certain of these obligations are imposed by applicable  law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in user-friendly  communities of like-minded members, such as Talent.me:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>You must, at all times, respect       the terms and conditions of the then-current&nbsp;<a href="https://talent.me/docs/privacy.php">Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://talent.me/docs/terms.php" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions.</a>&nbsp;This       includes respecting all intellectual property rights, which may belong to       third parties (such as photographs).</li>
    <li>You must not download or       otherwise disseminate any information, which may be deemed to be       injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may       otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of Talent.me and its community of       Users.</li>
    <li>You must not provide information       to Talent.me and /or other Users, which you believe might be injurious or       detrimental to your person, professional or social status.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Any violation of these guidelines may lead to  the restriction, suspension or termination of your account by Talent.me, as we  take these principles seriously and consider them to be the basis on which our  Users adhere to the Talent.me website and the services which it offers.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>5. Important Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
      <strong>Minors</strong><br>
    Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the  age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>No information from children under age 13</strong>&nbsp;If you are under age 13,  please do not attempt to register for Talent.me or provide any personal  information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal  information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as  quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a  child under age 13, please contact us through&nbsp;<a href="https://talent.me/about/contact.php">this help page</a>.<br>
  <br>
    By becoming a User, you have given us your express and informed consent to  transfer the data which you provide to us to the United   States and to process it in the United States.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
    We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please  review it frequently. If we change how we use your personally identifiable  information, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our  home page. If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those  changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and/or other places we deem  appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use  it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
    If you use the Talent.me service after notice of changes have been sent to you  or published on our site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed  practices.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>6. Security</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    In order to secure your personal information, access to your data on Talent.me  is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is  protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and  the Talent.me web site. To protect any data you store on our servers we also  regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and we use  a tier-one secured-access data center. It is your responsibility to protect the  security of your login information. Please note that emails and instant messaging  and similar means of communication with other users of Talent.me are not  encrypted and we strongly request you not to communicate any confidential  information through these means.<br>
