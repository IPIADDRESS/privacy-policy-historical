        <p><a name="anchor1063070"></a><b>Registration:</b></p>
        <p>We ask our user to first complete the registration form. During
        registration a user is required to give their some information
        such as name, email address, birth date information, gender,
        country of residence and zip code if applicable. We do ask for
        your occupation and marital status but this information is optional.
        We encouraged our users to register so we can provide a more
        personalized experience on our site.</p>
        <p>Any visitor over a certain age can join in and chat on our
        server as a guest without having to register or provide us with
        any personally identifiable information. If a visitor wishes
        to join our community and take part in other features like home
        pages, email accounts, etc., we then ask them to register.</p>

        customize the service, and target advertising, sponsorships,
        and email offers from us and our business partners based on our
        members' demographics, likes, dislikes, and affiliations. Examples
        of these co-branded partners would be NBC, Cox Interactive and
        CheckOut.com.</p>
        <p>At our discretion, we will make the information about Talk
        City's users available in aggregate form to help describe and
        identify our users to business partners, co-branded sites, the
        industry, and the public, as well as our advertisers. We will
        not share any detailed individual member information with other

        <p><a name="anchor1114489"></a><b>Security:</b></p>
        <p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users'
        information. When users submit sensitive information via the
        website, your information is protected both online and<br>
        off-line.</p>
        <p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive
        information (such as credit card number and/or social security
        number), that information is encrypted and is protected with
        the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on
        a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom
        of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
        Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when
        you are just 'surfing'.</p>
        <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
        online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information
        off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive
        information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only
        employees who need the information to perform a specific job
        (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative)
        are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our
        employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they
        leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their
        password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore,
        ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
        practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are
        added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance
        we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers'
        information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store
        personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment,
        behind a locked cage.</p>
