<p>It is Talk City's (and its parent studio, LiveWorld
Productions') policy to use its best efforts to respect the
privacy of its on-line visitors. Talk City does not use
cookie technology to obtain any information from its on-line
visitors. Talk City's cookie "lives" on your hard drive and
keeps track of our predefined browser settings: tool bar off
and music on, as well as demographic information, preferred
client, and nickname. This allows us to optimize your
on-line experience.

</p><p>We also track the total number of visitors to our site in
an aggregate form (this means you're one of the bunch, your
information isn't singled out) to allow us to update and
improve our site, and tell other people something about the
numbers of people who come to talkcity.com. Personally
identifiable information is not extracted in this process.

</p><p>Talk City only collects personally identifiable data,
such as names, addresses, email addresses, and the like,
when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. We will use the
information we collect from our members during the
registration process only to make Talk City better and more
responsive to users--to help us customize the service, and
target advertising, sponsorships, and email offers based on
our members' demographics, likes, dislikes, and
affiliations. At our discretion we will make the information
about Talk City's users available in aggregate form to help
describe and identify our users to our partners, the
industry and public at large, and our advertisers. <b>We
will not share any detailed individual member information
with other companies unless the member explicitly agrees to
our doing so</b>.

</p><p><b><font size="+1">Policies for Individuals 16 and
Under</font></b>

</p><p><font size="+1">No information should be submitted to or
posted at Talk City's Web sites by children 16 years of age
or under without their parent's or guardian's consent.
Unless otherwise disclosed during its collection, Talk City
does not provide any personally identifying information,
regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose
whatsoever. Talk City will not post anyone's email address
unless they specifically give their permission, as in the
"Make Friends" section of nickname and Home Page
registration. Talk City encourages parents and guardians to
spend time on-line with their children and to participate in
the interactive activities offered on the sites.</font>

</p><p><b><font size="+1">Information for Parents </font></b>

</p><p>We make a special effort to advise kids to get parental
permission before providing information or submitting stuff
to put on-line, and we urge parents to supervise their kids'
on-line use. Personally identifiable information may be
collected in response to registrations, Talk City Home
Pages, contest entry forms, subscribing to an email
newsletter, etc. This information will be used by Talk City
for internal purposes, and shared in aggregate form with our
partners, advertiser and third parties. We offer an
"unsubscribe" option if at any time they wish to cease
receiving emails from Talk City. Any changes in these
privacy policies by Talk City will be promptly communicated
on this page.

</p><p>In the Talk City nickname and Home Page registration
process, we have two clearly marked areas. Information
entered on the first page will be kept private. Information
on the second page (called Make Friends) will be shown on
the person's web page and chat profile, so caution should be
taken on what information is entered here.

</p><p><b><font size="+1">Links to Other Sites</font></b>

</p><p>We do our best to make sure that every link we have on
this site works and sends you to a clean and well lit place
on the World Wide Web. But because Web sites can change so
quickly, we can't guarantee the content of every link from
the places we link to (get it?). Young people: it's always a
good idea to check with your parents or teacher before
heading off to any new sites.
