          <br>
          This site may contain links to other sites, and we take great care in 
          selecting those links. However,&nbsp;TALX Corporation is not responsible 
          for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites. We strongly

        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We collect aggregate information 
            site-wide, including anonymous site statistics. We also log domain 
            names and/or IP addresses. We use your IP address to help diagnose 
            problems with our server, and to administer our web site as well as 
            improve the site-wide experience for you and other users. We also 
            link IP addresses to personally identifiable information within our 
            eCommerce site in order to ensure the security of our service for 
            all users. In these cases, the IP address and personally identifiable 
            information becomes part of an audit trail that we may use to identify 
            the source of a specific transaction.<br>

            the single, previous Web site address that visitors come from when 
            accessing our site. This is standard practice throughout the Internet, 
            and it is used to determine how visitors navigate to our sites. We 
            do not, however, attach this information to anything that is personally 
            identifiable. In other words, while we may track what site you came 
            from, we do not directly connect that information with anything that 
            identifies you.<br>

            If used, this small file helps to improve the user's experience by 
            allowing us to customize or tailor the web pages that the visitor 
            sees and uses for their specific needs. For example, we may use a 
            cookie to allow a user to by-pass having to enter their username every 
            time they login. For frequent visitors, this type of functionality 
            and personalization can greatly improve their experience. These cookies 
            DO NOT contain confidential or personal information. While we may 
            use cookies to help us understand and improve the navigation of our

            security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration 
            of the information under our control. Portions of our site make extensive 
            use of&nbsp; Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, the Internet's 
            leading encryption standard, as well as password-like identifying 
            information.&nbsp;SSL is used to encrypt the information being sent 
            between a visitors computer and our web site. <br>
            <br>
            Encryption is a process in which the information being transmitted 
            between two parties is "scrambled" in transit. SSL encryption 
            creates a secure link between two computers by establishing a process 
            in which each computer can unscramble (unencrypt) the other's information. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Because we take the protection of your data very seriously, you may 
            be asked to "upgrade" your Internet browser to a more recent 
            version if it does not currently support the high levels of SSL encryption 
            that portions of our web site require.<br>

          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your browser 
            should indicate whether or not it is operating in a secure site. Most 
            browsers will display an alert box advising you that you are requesting 
            pages from a secure site, and they will ask your permission to continue. 
            Most browsers will also alert you when you are leaving a secure site, 
            and again, ask you permission to continue. However, this alert feature 
            can be turned off within the browser's preferences. If you have doubts 
            about whether or not you are on a secured web page, contact the web 
            site's operator to clarify your questions, and DO NOT transmit sensitive 
            information like credit card numbers until you are confident of the 
            page's security.<br>
