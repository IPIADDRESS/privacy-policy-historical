<p style="margin:1em"><a href="http://clicktoverify.truste.com/pvr.php?page=validate&amp;url=www.talentwise.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.talentwise.com/screening/images/seal_ctv_en.png" class="pngfix" style=" height:82px; width:60px; border-style: none;" alt="TRUSTe Certified - Click to Verify"></a></p>
<p>TalentWise is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
