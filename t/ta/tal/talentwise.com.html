<h2 id="sts"><span style="color: #0076ce;">Sterling Talent Solutions</span></h2>
<p><span>Sterling Talent Solutions respects the privacy of its online visitors, employees, clients and client-employees. We treat all submitted personal data as private and confidential. We do not sell or otherwise transfer this information to any third party organization, except as provided below.</span></p>
<p>Please review this policy carefully. This policy is current as of February 14, 2013. Sterling Talent Solutions reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time, in which event the Site will contain a notice of the change. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site. By accessing the Site, you are indicating your agreement to the Company's privacy policy. This policy applies to all users of this site. In addition, the personal information of certain users may be subject to additional protections required under the <em>U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles</em>. Click here for more information concerning our <a href="http://www.sterlingtalentsolutions.com/about/euprivacy/">EU &amp; Switzerland Data Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED.</strong></p>
<p>As you are probably aware, in the course of our contact or relationship with you, we may collect information from a variety of sources. We collect this information in order to carry out our business functions and provide the highest quality of service to you. Most of our information comes directly from you, such as when you forward to us information, photographs, videos and other data, files and/or correspondence. You also may provide information about yourself in connection with an application for employment.</p>
<p>Through our service to Company clients to conduct background and criminal record checks, drug testing, and employment verification, Sterling Talent Solutions also collects and processes personal information of individuals who apply for employment at Sterling Talent Solutions' clients ("client-employees" and "client-employee personal information"). Sterling Talent Solutions will conduct client services in accordance with the notice given to and/or the consent obtained from client-employees. Sterling Talent Solutions will not sell or share client-employee personal information to third parties other than the client on whose behalf the personal information was collected, and as except as permitted by law and this privacy policy. Sterling Talent Solutions collects client-employee personal information for, among other things, legitimate business reasons such as client service; product, warranty and claims administration; meeting governmental reporting and records requirements; maintenance of accurate accounts payable and receivable records; internal marketing research; safety and performance management; financial and sales data; and contact information. All personal information collected by Sterling Talent Solutions will be used for legitimate business purposes consistent with this Policy.</p>
<p><span>Sterling Talent Solutions may compile statistical information concerning the usage of the Site. This information allows Sterling Talent Solutions to monitor its utilization and continuously improve its quality. Examples of this information would include, but not be limited to, the number of visitors to the Site, or to sections or pages within the Site, patterns of traffic flowing through the Site, length of time spent on the Site, or in sections or pages of the Site, the other sites that refer visitors to the Site, the pages of the Site that visitors frequently use as entry and exit points, utilization of the browser and operating systems and versions used by visitors to the Site, etc. Because such non-personal information does not identify who you are, we do not limit the ways we may use or share non-personal information. For example, we may share non-personal information with our affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents, other businesses, and the government.</span></p>
<p><span>Sterling Talent Solutions may also collect anonymous information concerning website users through the use of "cookies" in order to provide better Client service. "Cookies" are small files that websites place on users' computers to identify the user and enhance the website experience. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. Visitors may set their browsers to provide notice before they receive a cookie, giving the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. Visitors can also set their browsers to turn off cookies. If visitors do so, however, some areas of Sterling Talent Solutions websites may not function properly.</span></p>
<p><span>None of Sterling Talent Solutions' websites are directed toward children. Nevertheless, Sterling Talent Solutions is committed to complying with applicable laws and requirements, such as the United States'&nbsp;<em>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act&nbsp;</em>("COPPA").</span></p>
<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<p><span>In the course of our normal business activities, we may disclose collected information to both affiliates and non-affiliated entities, as we deem necessary and appropriate. Except as required or permitted by law or this Policy, we will not disclose your information for any purposes other than those in conjunction with our business activities. For example, if the company enters into bankruptcy, it may need to transfer personal information to another company as part of the resolution of the bankruptcy. We endeavor to choose non-affiliates with similar standards to ours regarding the protection of private information.</span></p>
<p><span>Sterling Talent Solutions generally does not require certain personal information to obtain access to any area of the Site, such as Social Security numbers. However, if you decide to provide personal information to Sterling Talent Solutions, in no case will the Sterling Talent Solutions sell, license or transmit that information to third parties, except as required by law or as permitted by law or by this Policy. Any information that you voluntarily share with Sterling Talent Solutions in a form is kept confidential and fully secure.</span></p>
<p><span>Sterling Talent Solutions website users have the option to request that Sterling Talent Solutions not use information previously provided, correct information previously provided, or remove information previously provided to Sterling Talent Solutions. Those that would like to correct or suppress information they have provided to Sterling Talent Solutions should use the contact information provided below. The inquiries should include the individual's name, address, and other relevant contact information (phone number, email address), as well as the nature of the request. Except as required by law, Sterling Talent Solutions is free to deny such requests. If Sterling Talent Solutions is decides to grant such a request, it will use all reasonable efforts to honor such requests as soon as practicable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>SAFEGUARDING OF INFORMATION.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Online privacy is paramount for Sterling Talent Solutions. Owing to the sensitive nature of our public record searches, the management and distribution of such information is protected by the highest levels of security. We employ numerous practices to protect against the disclosure of information for purposes unrelated to the performance of our business functions or to individuals other than those who must use it in the course of their work activities. These practices include the use of password protection of computer files, e-mail and voice-mail, video surveillance, and other physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Additionally, all data received by Sterling Talent Solutions over its online network is delivered over a secure socket layer. We maintain redundant electronic and physical security measures, which exceed the provisions and policies mandated by the Privacy Act, to safeguard all personal and public record data.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>United States or Overseas:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Personal Data and Client-Employee Personal Data collected by Sterling Talent Solutions are maintained at a secured data center located in the United States and may be transferred to 3rd parties outside of the United States.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Sterling Talent Solutions performs thorough background checks on all of its employees and onsite suppliers. These checks include criminal history searches, credit checks, motor vehicle searches, social security trace reports, employment verifications, education verifications, drug testing and skills assessment. Additionally, Sterling Talent Solutions' offices and offsite hosting facilities are secured by state of the art security systems. Of course, no set of safeguards is 100% secure. This means that, for example, despite our best efforts, an unauthorized access or acquisition of your information could occur. In that case, we will do our best to mitigate harm to you and, where appropriate notify you of the incident.</span></p>
<p><span>Sterling Talent Solutions websites may contain links to other "non-Sterling Talent Solutions" websites. Sterling Talent Solutions assumes no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies and practices on those websites. Sterling Talent Solutions encourages all users to read the privacy statements of those sites; their privacy practices may differ from those of Sterling Talent Solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>This Privacy Policy is governed by the internal substantive laws of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under or out of this Privacy Policy shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts within New York. If any provision of this Privacy Policy is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Privacy Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
<p><span>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL STERLING TALENT SOLUTIONS HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN INFORMATION ON THE SITE, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES THAT MAY OCCUR WHILE ACCESSING THE SITE, OR ANY LINKED SITE, OR THE INABILITY TO ACCESS THESE SITES; OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE; OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE BREACH OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, HOWEVER OCCASIONED.</span></p>

<p><strong>Personal Information Collected from Website Visitors</strong></p>
<p>In general, a visitor to the TalentWise Website ("you" or "Website Visitor") can visit the TalentWise Website without providing any personal information about yourself.

Please note that this Privacy Statement, as it relates to our collection of personal information via third party social networking sites, applies only to our direct collection of your personal information from you and not to your activities on the social networking site generally. Each social networking site's collection and use of your personal information when you use a particular social networking site is governed by that social networking site's Privacy Statement, which we ask that you also carefully review.</p>

Some of these service providers may be located in the United States and in other jurisdictions that may not offer the same level of protection to your personal information as that provided by your home country. However, we require these third parties to use Website Visitor Personal Information only as instructed by us and for no other purpose.

<h3 id="cookies_and_other_web_technologies"><span style="color: #0076ce;">Cookies and Other Web Technologies</span></h3>
<p><span>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by TalentWise and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</span></p>
<p><span>We use cookies for our TalentWise Website, to remember users' settings, or for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</span></p>
<p><span>Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use Local Storage such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</span></p>
<p><strong>Third Party Tracking.</strong> Service providers and other third parties such as advertisers may use information gathering technologies on the TalentWise Website (including cookies and beacons) to collect anonymous information in connection with their services. This information is controlled by the relevant affiliated company or third party and is not controlled by us; specifically, (i) such information is governed by the Privacy Statement and terms of use of the relevant other party and (ii) we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1/#completed" target="_blank">NAI website</a> (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1/#completed) and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">DAA website</a> (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). E.U. users can also visit <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> (http://youronlinechoices.eu/). Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. To opt out of Google Analytics, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.</p>
<p>TalentWise does not currently commit to responding to browsers' Do Not Track ("DNT") signals with respect to the TalentWise Website, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. However, you do have the ability to opt-out of some of the tracking features on the TalentWise Website by using the links set out above.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0076ce;">TalentWise Screening, Hiring, Onboarding and Other Services</span></h3>

<p>Personal information necessary to perform the Services is collected from the Service Requester, their Applicant Tracking System ("ATS"), or from the Candidate directly. We also will collect personal information about Candidates through the process of fulfilling the requested service.

<p><span>We may share Candidate Personal Information with the following and as described </span><a href="#additional_disclosures">below</a>. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Service Requesters.</p>
<p><strong>Service Requesters.</strong> We will share Candidate Personal Information provided to us, and obtained through fulfillment of the requested service, with the Service Requester. In some cases, we may share Candidate Personal Information through integration with the Service Requester's software platform or ATS.</p>

<p><strong><span>International Transfers of Candidate Personal Information.</span></strong> <span>In performing international searches, Candidate Personal Information will be shared as necessary with third party service providers outside the Candidate's home country. Some of these service providers may be located in the United States and in other jurisdictions that may not offer the same level of protection to personal information as that provided by the Candidate's home country. However, we require these third parties to use Candidate Personal Information only as instructed by us and for no other purpose. All Candidate Personal Information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner consistent with the terms of this Privacy Statement.

All personal information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong><span>E.U./Swiss Candidate Personal Information</span></strong></p>
<p><span>TalentWise recognizes that the European Union and Switzerland have implemented "omnibus" data protection regimes established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, respectively. These laws require a legal basis for the transfer of certain individually identifiable data about individuals in European Union member countries and Switzerland to TalentWise in the United States. TalentWise maintains such a legal basis supporting transfers of personal data to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, TalentWise complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Principles and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Candidate Personal Information. TalentWise adheres to these Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. With respect to Candidate Personal Information collected from European Union member countries and Switzerland, the Service Requester acts as a data controller/owner and TalentWise acts a data processor of such information.</span></p>
<p>To learn more about the Safe Harbor Principles and to view TalentWise's certification under these Principles, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp.

<p><span>12. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Party agrees: (i) that it will use (and will ensure that its employees, Affiliates, agents, contractors and any approved third parties use) reasonable efforts (which shall be no less than the efforts used to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature) to prevent the disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information to any person or entity, unless authorized by the other Party; and (ii) it will not use Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than as authorized by this Agreement or by the other Party. As to TALENTWISE, the term "Confidential Information" includes information specifically designated as confidential or that would be understood to be confidential or proprietary by a reasonable person, the features and functions of the Services that are not available to the general public via the public Internet (including screen shots of the same), future product plans, and any Documentation or specification provided to Company, the commercial terms (including pricing) of this Agreement and any Statement of Work (but not the mere existence of this Agreement), performance and security test results (whether conducted by TALENTWISE or Company), and any other proprietary, financial or business information supplied to Company by TALENTWISE. As to Company, the term "Confidential Information" includes information specifically designated as confidential or that would be understood to be confidential or proprietary by a reasonable person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" shall not include (i) information which is or becomes publicly known through no act of omission of the receiving Party, or (ii) information gained by the receiving Party independent of the disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of this Agreement to disclose Confidential Information required to be disclosed pursuant to administrative or court order, government or regulatory investigation or requirement, or arbitration or litigation arising out of this Agreement; provided, however, that to the extent permissible, each Party shall, in advance of any such disclosure promptly notify the other Party in order to enable the other Party reasonable time to seek a protective order with respect to the requested information or otherwise challenge or oppose the disclosure requirement. The Parties acknowledge that use or disclosure of any Confidential Information of the other Party in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement may give rise to irreparable injury to the disclosing Party or to third parties who have entrusted information to the disclosing Party, and such disclosure may be inadequately compensable in damages. Accordingly, in addition to any other legal remedies that may be available at law or in equity, the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable or injunctive relief against the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information. For avoidance of doubt, the Software Service is designed to facilitate sharing of Company Data by Company and its Users for permitted purposes. Accordingly, Company Data is not "Confidential Information" for purposes of this Section 12. TALENTWISE's obligations with respect to Company Data are as set forth in Section 2.1.2 (Protection of Company Data).</span></p>

<p><span>Company understands that searches of international background screening will be conducted through the services of a third-party independent contractor. Because of differences in foreign laws, language, and the manner in which foreign records are maintained and reported, TALENTWISE cannot be either an insurer or a guarantor of the accuracy of the information reported. Company therefore releases TALENTWISE and its affiliated companies, officers, agents, employees, and independent contractors from any liability whatsoever in connection with erroneous information received as a result of an international background screening report.</span></p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><span>NOTICE TO USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS:&nbsp;<br>
OBLIGATIONS OF USERS UNDER THE FCRA</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
</span></p>
<p><span>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. §1681-1681y, requires that this notice be provided to inform users of consumer reports of their legal obligations. State law may impose additional requirements. The text of the FCRA is set forth in full at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) website at<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0076ce;">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>. At the end of this document is a list of United States Code citations for the FCRA. Other information about user duties is also available at CFPB's website.&nbsp;<strong>Users must consult the relevant provisions of the FCRA for details about their obligations under the FCRA.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The first section of this summary sets forth the responsibilities imposed by the FCRA on all users of consumer reports. The subsequent sections discuss the duties of users of reports that contain specific types of information, or that are used for certain purposes, and the legal consequences of violations. If you are a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency (CRA), you have additional obligations and will receive a separate notice from the CRA describing your duties as a furnisher.</span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
</span></p>
<p><span>I.&nbsp;<strong>OBLIGATIONS OF ALL USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
</span></p>
<p><span>A.&nbsp;<strong>Users Must Have a Permissible Purpose</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
Congress has limited the use of consumer reports to protect consumers' privacy. All users must have a permissible purpose under the FCRA to obtain a consumer report. Section 604 contains a list of the permissible purposes under the law. These are:<br clear="all">
</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span>As ordered by a court or a federal grand jury subpoena.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a)(1)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>As instructed by the consumer in writing.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a)(2)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>For the extension of credit as a result of an application from a consumer, or the review or collection of a consumer's account.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a)(3)(A)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>For employment purposes, including hiring and promotion decisions, where the consumer has given written permission.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sections 604(a)(3)(B) and 604(b)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>For the underwriting of insurance as a result of an application from a consumer.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a)(3)(C)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>When there is a legitimate business need, in connection with a business transaction that is initiated by the consumer.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a)(3)(F)(i)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>To review a consumer's account to determine whether the consumer continues to meet the terms of the account.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a) (3)(F)(ii)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>To determine a consumer's eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental instrumentality required by law to consider an applicant's financial responsibility or status.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a)(3)(D)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>For use by a potential investor or servicer, or current insurer, in a valuation or assessment of the credit or prepayment risks associated with an existing credit obligation.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 604(a)(3)(E)</span></span></li>
    <li><span>For use by state and local officials in connection with the determination of child support payments, or modifications and enforcement thereof.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sections 604(a)(4) and 604(a)(5)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, creditors and insurers may obtain certain consumer report information for the purpose of making "prescreened" unsolicited offers of credit or insurance. Section 604(c). The particular obligations of users of "prescreened" information are described in Section VII below.</span></p>
<p><span><br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>B. <strong>Users Must Provide Certifications</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Section 604(f) prohibits any person from obtaining a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency (CRA) unless the person has certified to the CRA the permissible purpose(s) for which the report is being obtained and certifies that the report will not be used for any other purpose.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>C. <strong>Users Must Notify Consumers When Adverse Actions Are Taken</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The term "adverse action" is defined very broadly by Section 603. "Adverse actions" include all business, credit, and employment actions affecting consumers that can be considered to have a negative impact as defined by Section 603(k) of the FCRA — such as denying or canceling credit or insurance, or denying employment or promotion. No adverse action occurs in a credit transaction where the creditor makes a counteroffer that is accepted by the consumer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. <strong>Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From a CRA</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If a user takes any type of adverse action as defined by the FCRA that is based at least in part on information contained in a consumer report, Section 615(a) requires the user to notify the consumer. The notification may be done in writing, orally, or by electronic means. It must include the following:</span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span>The name, address, and telephone number of the CRA (including a toll-free telephone number, if it is a nationwide CRA) that provided the report.</span></li>
    <li><span>A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse decision and is not able to explain why the decision was made.</span></li>
    <li><span>A statement setting forth the consumer's right to obtain a free disclosure of the consumer's file from the CRA if the consumer makes a request within 60 days.</span></li>
    <li><span>A statement setting forth the consumer's right to dispute directly with the CRA the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by the CRA.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><br clear="all">
</span></p>
<p><span>2. <strong>Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From Third Parties Who Are Not Consumer Reporting Agencies</strong><br clear="all">
If a person denies (or increases the charge for) credit for personal, family, or household purposes based either wholly or partly upon information from a person other than a CRA, and the information is the type of consumer information covered by the FCRA, Section 615(b)(1) requires that the user clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer his or her right to be told the nature of the information that was relied upon if the consumer makes a written request within 60 days of notification. The user must provide the disclosure within a reasonable period of time following the consumer's written request.</span></p>
<p><span><br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>3. <strong>Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From Affiliates</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If a person takes an adverse action involving insurance, employment, or a credit transaction initiated by the consumer, based on information of the type covered by the FCRA, and this information was obtained from an entity affiliated with the user of the information by common ownership or control, Section 615(b)(2) requires the user to notify the consumer of the adverse action. The notice must inform the consumer that he or she may obtain a disclosure of the nature of the information relied upon by making a written request within 60 days of receiving the adverse action notice. If the consumer makes such a request, the user must disclose the nature of the information not later than 30 days after receiving the request. If consumer report information is shared among affiliates and then used for an adverse action, the user must make an adverse action disclosure as set forth in I.C.1 above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>D. <strong>Users Have Obligations When Fraud and Active Duty Military Alerts are in Files</strong><br clear="all">
When a consumer has placed a fraud alert, including one relating to identify theft, or an active duty military alert with a nationwide consumer reporting agency as defined in Section 603(p) and resellers, Section 605A(h) imposes limitations on users of reports obtained from the consumer reporting agency in certain circumstances, including the establishment of a new credit plan and the issuance of additional credit cards. For initial fraud alerts and active duty alerts, the user must have reasonable policies and procedures in place to form a belief that the user knows the identity of the applicant or contact the consumer at a telephone number specified by the consumer; in the case of extended fraud alerts, the user must contact the consumer in accordance with the contact information provided in the consumer's alert.</span></p>
<p><span><br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>E. <strong>Users Have Obligations When Notified of an Address Discrepancy</strong><br clear="all">
Section 605(h) requires nationwide CRAs, as defined in Section 603(p), to notify users that request reports when the address for a consumer provided by the user in requesting the report is substantially different from the addresses in the consumer's file. When this occurs, users must comply with regulations specifying the procedures to be followed. Federal regulations are available at<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0076ce;">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>F.&nbsp;<strong>Users Have Obligations When Disposing of Records</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Section 628 requires that all users of consumer report information have in place procedures to properly dispose of records containing this information. Federal regulations have been issued that cover disposal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>II. <strong>CREDITORS MUST MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If a person uses a consumer report in connection with an application for, or a grant, extension, or provision of, credit to a consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person, based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the person must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer in accordance with regulations prescribed by the CFPB.</span></p>
<p><span>Section 609(g) requires a disclosure by all persons that make or arrange loans secured by residential real property (one to four units) and that use credit scores. These persons must provide credit scores and other information about credit scores to applicants, including the disclosure set forth in Section 609(g)(1)(D) ("Notice to the Home Loan Applicant").</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>III. <strong>OBLIGATIONS OF USERS WHEN CONSUMER REPORTS ARE OBTAINED FOR EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A. <strong>Employment Other Than in the Trucking Industry</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the information from a CRA is used for employment purposes, the user has specific duties, which are set forth in Section 604(b) of the FCRA. The user must:<br clear="all">
</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span>Make a clear and conspicuous written disclosure to the consumer before the report is obtained, in a document that consists solely of the disclosure, that a consumer report may be obtained.</span></li>
    <li><span>Obtain from the consumer prior written authorization. Authorization to access reports during the term of employment may be obtained at the time of employment.</span></li>
    <li><span>Certify to the CRA that the above steps have been followed, that the information being obtained will not be used in violation of any federal or state equal opportunity law or regulation, and that, if any adverse action is to be taken based on the consumer report, a copy of the report and a summary of the consumer's rights will be provided to the consumer.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Before</span></strong><span>&nbsp;taking an adverse action, the user must provide a copy of the report to the consumer as well as the summary of consumer's rights (The user should receive this summary from the CRA.) A Section 615(a) adverse action notice should be sent after the adverse action is taken.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>An adverse action notice also is required in employment situations if credit information (other than transactions and experience data) obtained from an affiliate is used to deny employment.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 615(b)(2)</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The procedures for investigative consumer reports and employee misconduct investigations are set forth below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>B. <strong>Employment in the Trucking Industry</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
Special rules apply for truck drivers where the only interaction between the consumer and the potential employer is by mail, telephone, or computer. In this case, the consumer may provide consent orally or electronically, and an adverse action may be made orally, in writing, or electronically. The consumer may obtain a copy of any report relied upon by the trucking company by contacting the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>IV. <strong>OBLIGATIONS WHEN INVESTIGATIVE CONSUMER REPORTS ARE USED</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
Investigative consumer reports are a special type of consumer report in which information about a consumer's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living is obtained through personal interviews by an entity or person that is a consumer reporting agency. Consumers who are the subjects of such reports are given special rights under the FCRA. If a user intends to obtain an investigative consumer report, Section 606 requires the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span>The user must disclose to the consumer that an investigative consumer report may be obtained. This must be done in a written disclosure that is mailed, or otherwise delivered, to the consumer at some time before or not later than three days after the date on which the report was first requested. The disclosure must include a statement informing the consumer of his or her right to request additional disclosures of the nature and scope of the investigation as described below, and the summary of consumer rights required by Section 609 of the FCRA. (The summary of consumer rights will be provided by the CRA that conducts the investigation.)</span></li>
    <li><span>The user must certify to the CRA that the disclosures set forth above have been made and that the user will make the disclosure described below.</span></li>
    <li><span>Upon the written request of a consumer made within a reasonable period of time after the disclosures required above, the user must make a complete disclosure of the nature and scope of the investigation. This must be made in a written statement that is mailed or otherwise delivered, to the consumer no later than five days after the date on which the request was received from the consumer or the report was first requested, whichever is later in time.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>V. <strong>SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR EMPLOYMEE INVESTIGATIONS</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Section 603(x) provides special procedures for investigations of suspected misconduct by an employee or for compliance with Federal, state or local laws and regulations or the rules of a self-regulatory organization, and compliance with written policies of the employer. These investigations are not treated as consumer reports so long as the employer or its agent complies with the procedures set forth in Section 603(x), and a summary describing the nature and scope of the inquiry is made to the employee if an adverse action is taken based on the investigation.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>VI. <strong>OBLIGATIONS OF USERS OF MEDICAL INFORMATION</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
Section 604(g) limits the use of medical information obtained from consumer reporting agencies (other than payment information that appears in a coded form that does not identify the medical provider). If the information is to be used for an insurance transaction, the consumer must give consent to the user of the report or the information must be coded. If the report is to be used for employment purposes — or in connection with a credit transaction (except as provided in federal regulations) — the consumer must provide specific written consent and the medical information must be relevant. Any user who receives medical information shall not disclose the information to any other person (except where necessary to carry out the purpose for which the information was disclosed, or a permitted by statute, regulation, or order).<br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>VII. <strong>OBLIGATIONS OF USERS OF "PRESCREENED" LISTS</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br clear="all">
The FCRA permits creditors and insurers to obtain limited consumer report information for use in connection with unsolicited offers of credit or insurance under certain circumstances. Sections 603(1), 604(c), 604(e), and 615(d). This practice is known as "prescreening" and typically involves obtaining from a CRA a list of consumers who meet certain preestablished criteria. If any person intends to use prescreened lists, that person must (1) before the offer is made, establish the criteria that will be relied upon to make the offer and grant credit or insurance, and (2) maintain such criteria on file for a three-year period beginning on the date on which the offer is made to each consumer. In addition, any user must provide with each written solicitation a clear and conspicuous statement that:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span>Information contained in a consumer's CRA file was used in connection with the transaction.</span></li>
    <li><span>The consumer received the offer because he or she satisfied the criteria for credit worthiness or insurability used to screen for the offer.</span></li>
    <li><span>Credit or insurance may not be extended if, after the consumer responds, it is determined that the consumer does not meet the criteria used for screening or any applicable criteria bearing on credit worthiness or insurability, or the consumer does not furnish required collateral.</span></li>
    <li><span>The consumer may prohibit the use of information in his or her file in connection with future prescreened offers of credit or insurance by contacting the notification system established by the CRA that provided the report. The statement must include the address and toll-free telephone number of the appropriate notification system.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the CFPB has established the format, type size, and manner of the disclosure required by Section 615(d), with which users must comply. The relevant regulation is 12 CFR 1022.54.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>VIII. <strong>OBLIGATIONS OF RESELLERS</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A. <strong>Disclosure and Certification Requirements</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Section 607(e) requires any person who obtains a consumer report for resale to take the following steps:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span>Disclose the identity of the end-user to the source CRA.</span></li>
    <li><span>Identify to the source CRA each permissible purpose for which the report will be furnished to the end-user.</span></li>
    <li><span>Establish and follow reasonable procedures to ensure that reports are resold only for permissible purposes, including procedures to obtain:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>(1) the identify of all end-users;</span></p>
<p><span>(2) certifications from all users of each purpose for which reports will be used; and</span></p>
<p><span>(3) certifications that reports will not be used for any purpose other than the purpose(s) specified to the reseller. Resellers must make reasonable efforts to verify this information before selling the report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>B. <strong>Reinvestigations by Resellers</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Under Section 611(f), if a consumer disputes the accuracy or completeness of information in a report prepared by a reseller, the reseller must determine whether this is a result of an action or omission on its part and, if so, correct or delete the information. If not, the reseller must send the dispute to the source CRA for reinvestigation. When any CRA notifies the reseller of the results of an investigation, the reseller must immediately convey the information to the consumer.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span>C. <strong>Fraud Alerts and Resellers</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Section 605A(f) requires resellers who receive fraud alerts or active duty alerts from another consumer reporting agency to include these in their reports.</span></p>
<p><span>IX.&nbsp;<strong>LIABILITY FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FCRA</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Failure to comply with the FCRA can result in state government or federal government enforcement actions, as well as private lawsuits.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sections 616, 617, and 621</span>. In addition, any person who knowingly and willfully obtains a consumer report under false pretenses may face criminal prosecution.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 619</span>.</span></p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><span>A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA.&nbsp;<strong>For more information, including information about additional rights, go to<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0076ce;">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>&nbsp;or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552</strong>.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong><span>You must be told if information in your file has been used against you.</span></strong><span> Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment — or to take another adverse action against you — must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>You have the right to know what is in your file.</span></strong><span>You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your "file disclosure"). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:</span></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li><span>a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;</span></li>
        <li><span>you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file;</span></li>
        <li><span>your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud;</span></li>
        <li><span>you are on public assistance;</span></li>
        <li><span>you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.</span></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; background: white;"><span>In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0076ce;">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>&nbsp;for additional information.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong><span>You have the right to ask for a credit score.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0076ce;">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>&nbsp;for an explanation of dispute procedures.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Access to your file is limited.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need — usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0076ce;">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>You may limit "prescreened" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Unsolicited "prescreened" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-567-8688.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>You may seek damages from violators.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0076ce;">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your federal rights, contact:</span></strong></p>
