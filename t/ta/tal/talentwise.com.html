This statement discloses the information practices for the web pages associated with the domain www.talentwise.com (the "website") and any applications, pages, or groups that are operated by us (the "Applications") on a social networking site such as Facebook, including what type of personal information we gather and track, how we use this personal information, and with whom we share the personal information.</p>

<p>Please note that this privacy policy, as it relates to our collection of information via our Applications, applies only to our Applications and not to your activities on the social networking site generally.  Each social networking site's collection and use of your personal information when you use the social networking site is governed by that social networking site's privacy policy, which we ask that you also read and accept.</p>

<h2>Information Collection on Our Website</h2>

<p>In general, you can visit our website without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. Personal information is collected only with your consent and may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, education and employment information, user id and password, information supplied in connection with applying for an account, any responses you choose to provide to survey questions, or any inquires you may make through our website. We do not share, sell, rent or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you of how we will use your information, before you provide it. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this information in this manner or to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes.</p>

<p>In connection with an authorized employment or tenant screening of an applicant, we collect personal information about the applicant. We use this information only for the purpose of performing the authorized screening, and conduct such screening in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We do not use this information for any other purpose.</p>


<h2>Information Collection Via Social Networking Sites</h2>

<p>If you use our Application on a social networking site, you allow us to access certain information from your profile from that social networking site.  Please note that we use the term "Application" in the privacy policy to refer to groups, pages, and promotions we operate on social networking sites, including without limitation the TalentWise Facebook Page and associated Page Tabs, in addition to applications that are actually called "apps" and "applications".  The information you allow us to access through an Application is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the social networking site.  For example, we may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the social networking site and your preferences:</p>

<ul>

<li>Your "basic information" you have shared with everyone on the social networking site</li>

<li>Your profile picture or its URL</li>

<li>Your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo</li>

<li>The login e-mail you provided to that social networking site when you registered</li>

<li>Your "friends" information</li>

<li>Other information indicated as part of the "Request for Permission" prompt from the social networking site</li>

</ul>

<p>Your agreement to allow us to collect such information takes place when you "accept" or "allow" or "grant permission" (or similar terms) to one of our Applications on a social networking site.</p>

<p>When you use our Application on a social networking site, you may also provide personal information to us through the Application.  For example, when you use our Application to enter a promotion, respond to a survey, or subscribe to one of our newsletters or lists, we may ask that you provide certain information, which may include your e-mail address or other personal information.  When you provide information through the Application, you are providing this information to us, not to the social networking site.</p>


<h2>How We Use and Share Personal Information</h2>

<p>The following paragraphs describe in more detail how we may use the personal information you provide to us and with whom we may share it.</p>

<p><strong>Providing the Website and Application.</strong>  We may use information collected through this website or an Application to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of this website and the Application, and to administer any promotions you enter using this website or the Application in accordance with the official rules or other guidelines, information, restrictions, terms, or disclosures we publish related to the promotion.</p>

<p><strong>Fulfilling your Transaction Request.</strong> If you request something from this website, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the personal information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we will share information with service providers to help us bring you the products and services we offer, either directly as the provider of such product or service, or indirectly such as financial institutions for credit card processing, email service providers, outsourced customer service providers, survey providers, or postal service providers. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose. We also require these third parties to maintain your personal information in the strictest confidence.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information Disclosure: United States or Overseas.</strong>  Personal information submitted to TalentWise for a background screening investigation may at times be transferred outside of the United States and shared with 3rd parties in order to perform the background investigation. All personal information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Improving Products and Services.</strong> From time to time, we may use personal information to test and improve the quality of the products and services that we offer. We do not share information with third parties when your personal information is used for this purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Communications from Us.</strong> When you request something from this website, we will send you transactional emails related to your service request.

<p><strong>Marketing Use.</strong> The information you provide to us on this website and through an Application will also be used, with your permission, by us and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used for this purpose. Otherwise, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes. In addition, like many websites, we gather certain information automatically (including cookies and log files). This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer this website, to track users' movements around this website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Monitoring.</strong> In addition, service providers and other third parties such as advertisers may also use information gathering technologies on this website (including cookies and beacons) in connection with their services to collect anonymous information. Shared and/or collected information, as described above, is controlled by the relevant affiliated company or third party and is not controlled by us; specifically, (i) such information is governed by the privacy policy and terms of use of the relevant other party and (ii) we will in no way be responsible or liable to you for any data breach by such other party that compromises or otherwise affects your information.</p>

<h2>TalentWise Human Resources</h2>

<p>In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on this website or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We use this information throughout TalentWise and our affiliates for the purpose of employment consideration or otherwise responding to your inquiry. Unless you request that we don't, we may keep the information for future consideration.</p>


<h2>Cookies and Other Web Technologies</h2>

<p>We collect non-identifiable information from visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on TalentWise websites, but we do so in ways that keep our visitors' identities anonymous. TalentWise uses this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.</p>

<p>We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which is then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some TalentWise pages use cookies, sent by TalentWise or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You also can set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some websites may not work properly. Our TalentWise cookies are linked to personal information; however our third party vendor cookies only collect data in the aggregate.</p>


<h2>Disclosures Required By Law</h2>

<h2>Public Forums</h2>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
