        <p>From time to time, we may make changes to this policy, so please review it frequently. Whenever we make a change, we will post or otherwise make available the revised policy. We will endeavor to post the changes before they become effective. The effective date of the most recent version of this policy will appear at the top of this page. This policy applies to any information we collect from you. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you here.</p>
        <p><b>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>

        <p>None. We do not collect or store user’s personal information.</p>
        <p><i>Browsing the Site.</i> If you are browsing the TalkStreamLive site, we may track gross usage on a non-personally identifiable basis for our own internal use or to share gross impressions with third party advertisers. We do not track or have access to your personal data.</p>
