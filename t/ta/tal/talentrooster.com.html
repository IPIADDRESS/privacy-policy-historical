                    We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially

                    to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting business and
                    Visitors who register (“Authorized Customers”) to make use of the various services

                    social security number, and credit card/debit card information. Personally Identifiable
                    Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is,
                    without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected
                    to an identified individual.
                </p>
                <strong>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </strong>
                <p>
                    We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect
                    the following additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses,
                    phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size of
                    the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized
                    Customer intends to purchase or sell.
                </p>
                <strong>What organizations are collecting the information?</strong>

                    the following additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses,

                    of Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the nature and

                <strong>What organizations are collecting the information?</strong>
                <p>
                    In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service vendors
                    (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services
                    as credit, insurance, banking, and escrow services may collect this information
                    from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties
                    use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information
                    provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties
                    may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do
                    not store, retain, or use the information given to them.</p>
                <strong>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</strong>

                    service offerings, to fulfill the Services requested by Visitors and Authorized
                    Customers of the Site, and for administrative services (such as notifying Visitors
                    and/or Authorized Customers of changes to the Site). We may email Visitors and Authorized
                    Customers about existing or new Services on the Site or information related to the
                    subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information
                    to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries,
                    or to provide requested information.</p>
                <strong>With whom may the information may be shared?</strong>
                <p>
                    Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with
                    other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential transactions with other
                    Authorized Customers For example, we may send Personal Identifiable Information
                    about a job seeker to a potential employer. We may share aggregated information
                    about our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors and Authorized Customers,
                    with our affiliated agencies and third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity
                    to "opt out" of receiving information or being contacted by us or by any agency
                    acting on our behalf.
                </p>
                <strong>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?</strong>

                    Personally Identifiable Information collected by TalentRooster is securely stored
                    and is not accessible to third parties or employees of TalentRooster except for

                <strong>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution

                    from or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and affiliated agencies by responding
                    to emails as instructed, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@talentrooster.com">

                <strong>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</strong>
                <p>
                    Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information
                    about the preferences of our Visitors and the Services they select. We also use
                    Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For example,
                    if an Authorized Customer is logged on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes,
                    we will automatically log the Authorized Customer off.
                </p>
                <strong>How does TalentRooster use login information? </strong>
                <p>
                    TalentRooster uses login information, including, but not limited to, IP addresses,
                    ISPs, and browser types, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's
                    movement and use, and gather broad demographic information.
                </p>
                <strong>What partners or service providers have access to Personally Identifiable Information
                    from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on the Site?</strong>
                <p>
                    TalentRooster has entered into and will continue to enter into agreements and other
                    forms of affiliations with a number of vendors. Such vendors may have access to
                    certain Personally Identifiable Information on a need to know basis for evaluating
                    Authorized Customers for Services. Our privacy policy does not cover their collection
                    or use of this information.
                </p>
                <strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law.</strong>
                <p>
                    We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply with a court
                    order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement agency to release information.
                    We will also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary
                    to protect the safety of our Visitors and Authorized Customers.
                </p>
                <strong>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</strong>
                <p>
                    All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices. The Personally
                    Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorized Customers is only accessible
                    to a limited number of qualified employees who are given a password in order to
                    gain access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a
                    regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security
                    numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent
                    over the Internet. While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a
                    secure site, electronic communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering
                    and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take
                    place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such
                    occurrences.
                </p>
                <strong>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?</strong>
                <p>
                    Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally Identifiable
                    Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@talentrooster.com">
                        info@talentrooster.com</a>
                </p>
                <strong>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected
                    by the Site?</strong>
                <p>
                    We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate
                    Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting <a href="mailto:info@talentrooster.com">
                        info@talentrooster.com</a>. However, because of backups and records of deletions,
                    it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual
                    information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information
                    deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell,
                    transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual
                    in any way moving forward.
                </p>
                <strong>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</strong>
                <p>
                    We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy
                    policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy
                    policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information
                    that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed,
                    we will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized
                    Customer to prevent such disclosure.
                </p>
