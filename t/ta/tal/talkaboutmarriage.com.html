									<ul>
										<li><font face="Arial">Message 
									boards/forums:<br>Users of the site's Forums must register 
									separately for this service in order to post 
									messages, although they needn't register to 
									visit the site. During registration the user 
									is required to supply a username, password, 
									date of birth and email address. Other types 
									of personal information can be optionally 
									entered into the user profile, and optional 
									information entered into the user profile is 
									available for the public to see except for 
									"Age and Date of Birth" which is information 
									that each user can choose whether or not to

									forward a link, page, or documents to 
									someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a 
									friend". The user must provide their email 
									address, as well as that of the recipient. 
									This information is used only in the case of 
									transmission errors and, of course, to let 
									the recipient know who sent the email. The 
									information is not used for any other 
									purpose. </font></li>
										<li><font face="Arial">Polling:<br>We may offer interactive polls to users so 
									they can easily share their opinions with 
									other users and see what our audience thinks 
									about important issues. Opinions or other 
									responses to polls are aggregated and are 
									not identifiable to any particular user. 
									TalkAboutMarriage.com may use a system to 
									"tag" users after they have voted, so they 
									can vote only once on a particular question. 
									This tag is not correlated with information 
									about individual users.</font></li>
										<li><font face="Arial">Surveys:<br>TalkAboutMarriage.com may occasionally 
									conduct user surveys to better target our 
									content to our audience. We sometimes share 
									the aggregated demographic information in 
									these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers 
									and partners. We never share any of this 
									information about specific individuals with 
									any third party. </font></li>
