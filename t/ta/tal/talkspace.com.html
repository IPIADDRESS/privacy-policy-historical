Talkspace is cognizant and respects the formal promulgation of the existing European Union (EU) data privacy regulations. The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA and is commonly referred to as “GDPR.” Talkspace has always respected our Client’s Privacy (see our Privacy Policy) and we were already a HIPAA certified platform following stringent data privacy rules.<br><br>The basic tenants of the promulgated GDPR regulations include, but are not limited to the following:<br><br>Disclosure when you sell, transfer or third party marketing of User’s data: As outlined in this Terms of Use, Talkspace does not sell or transfer Client data and any marketing efforts are focused solely on internal information updates to our registered Clients.<br>Access to collected data: At Talkspace, you already have the ability to access your shared data (Your personal information, your emergency contact information and all your interactions with your Providers) and use it as you wish.<br>Clear Consent: At Talkspace our Terms of Use are clear on what consent we seek with regards to your data and prior to your engagement with your Provider, you review and agree to a further “informed consent” process.<br>Security: At Talkspace we have encrypted our data from day one and has always been stored all Private Health Information with full HIPAA compliance and in an anonymized form as required by the GDPR. <br>Notice/Audit: At Talkspace, we will provide our Clients notice of any data breach and we employ a full time security Officer, as well as engaging a third party security firm to periodically audit both or code and technology security as well as our HIPAA policies and procedures around data security.<br>‍<br>Finally, dependent of your EU country or origin, the GDPR takes into account what was previously termed the right “to forget” or request deletion of your data once you cease using a particular application or site. This particular tenant of the GDPR may conflict with applicable medical records retention laws. In the United States, this requires at least seven years of retention, which is common around the world and is sometime up to ten years or more in certain countries. So, unlike some data platforms, Talkspace cannot erase private health data directly upon a Client’s request, as it may be considered essential for other medical file retention purposes. Applicable individual country medical retention laws are generally considered an acceptable exception to the GDPR regulations regarding the right to deletion of certain data.</p><h2>Disputes</h2><p>You will resolve any claim, cause of action or dispute (claim) you have with us arising out of or relating to this Statement or Talkspace.com exclusively in a state or federal court located New York. The laws of the State of Delaware will govern this Statement, as well as any claim that might arise between you and us, without regard to conflict of law provisions.<br><br>If anyone brings a claim against us related to your actions, content or information on Talkspace.com, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to such claim.</p><h2>Social Networks and Talkspace</h2><p>These services allow the web site to access the data on your profile in the social networks, and to interact through your post.
