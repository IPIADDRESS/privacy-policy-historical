Talksurgery.com pledges that will not sell or use your materials to anyone.<br><br>

Because of the personal nature of reviews submitted, your name will be held confidential if you wish it so.  Not even us, the operators of talksurgery.com, through our secure registration form, will know your true identity<br><br>

<b>When does Talksurgery.com collect my personal information?</b><br> 
Talksurgery.com gathers information from members and visitors in four ways: voluntary registration, member-submitted reviews and bulletin board postings, cookie technology and IP addresses.<br><br>

<b>Registration</b><br>

<b>Reviews and Bulletin Boards</b><br>
Personal information becomes public when you disclose it to the Talksurgery.com web site.<br><br>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
We use cookies to store and track your preferences to provide you with a more personalized member experience. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet sites use cookies. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies (see below) but this will prevent you from using in most customized services, and you may have to repeatedly enter personal information in order to participate in various services or promotions. Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences and passwords. For example, if you choose "Automatic Login" during registration, Talksurgery.com will store a scrambled version of your Member ID in a permanent "cookie" file on your hard drive so that we can track your personalized services and preferences from one visit to the next. We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate our audience size, determine which areas of the Talksurgery.com Web site are the most popular, and serve targeted advertising. No advertiser's cookie is ever placed on members' computers.<br><br>

<b>IP Address</b><br>
We may log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, or to report information in aggregate form to our advertisers (e.g., how many visitors logged in to our Web site).

When you visit a particular Web page in the Talksurgery.com Web site, our servers log your IP address.<br><br>
<b>E-mail</b><br>

<b>Does Talksurgery.com share information?</b><br>
We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. <br><br>

<b>What are my options to control the use of my personal information?</b><br>
Most browsers can be configured to reject cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. You may cancel your registration to Talksurgery.com and/or request the removal of your personal information from our member records by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@talksurgery.com">privacy@talksurgery.com</a>.
