  <h5>Talgov.com Privacy Policy</h5>
      <p>The following pertains to all pages within the Talgov.com domain:</p>
      <p>Your privacy is important to us at Talgov.com. The purpose of this policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather when you visit our site and what we do with that information.</p>
      <p>The following is a current list of information we may collect during your visit, or information that you provide to us voluntarily, and how we handle that information. This policy is not intended and should not be interpreted as a contract of any nature, either stated or implied. This document may change without notice, so please revisit this page often.</p>
      <p><b>Automatically collected information upon visiting talgov.com<br>
  </b>In order to provide our visitors with a pleasant experience, our web servers collect some technical information automatically upon your visit. This includes your IP address, browser used, and date of visit. This information is collected to enhance our site by supplying us with statistics on web visits, and is only for internal use. <em>No <b>personally identifiable information</b> (name, address, email address, phone, etcâ€¦) is collected automatically.</em> The minimal information we do collect is kept confidential, and is used solely in summary form to enhance the services offered at Talgov.com, or to publish site usage statistics.</p>
      <p><b>Information you voluntarily supply to us</b></p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>If you send an email to us with a question or comment, and that email contains personally identifying information, that information may be used to contact you in responding to your email, or may be forwarded to another agency for help in responding to you. This information will not be sold, rented, or voluntarily supplied to any agency, commercial or private, unless required by law.</li>
        <li>If you fill out an interactive form, the information you provide may be used to respond to your request, or may be forwarded to another agency for help in responding to you. This information will not be sold, rented, or voluntarily supplied to any agency, commercial or private, unless required by law.</li>
        <li>If you fill out a form that enables any type of service, the information you supply may be used in processing your request, and may be collected for inclusion in databases or directories, to be used for internal purposes only. This information will not be sold, rented, or voluntarily supplied to any agency, commercial or private, unless required by law.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Email Addresses<br>
      </strong>Under Florida law, email addresses are public records. If you do not
        want your email address released in response to a public-records request,
        do not send electronic mail to this entity. Instead, contact this
        office by phone or in writing.</p>
      <p><b>Subscriptions<br>
      </b>If you subscribe to any service on Talgov.com that involves continuous delivery of information to you, your contact information will be kept on a separate distribution list for each service until you submit a request to unsubscribe. This distribution list will be kept confidential, and will not be sold, rented, or voluntarily supplied to any agency, unless required by law.</p>
      <p>If, at any time, you would like to unsubscribe from a distribution list, information on how to unsubscribe can be found at the end of the document sent to you.</p>
      <p><b>Cookies<br>
  </b>Talgov.com does not set or use cookies.</p>
      <p>Cookies are small files attached to some sites that track visitors and are accessed when revisiting the site that placed the cookie on your computer. They are used primarily for a more personal web experience, targeted advertising, and automatic completion of forms.</p>
      <p><b>Choice<br>
  </b>You may decline participation in any activity that asks for information (i.e., surveys or emails). Your choice to not participate will have no effect on your ability to access information on talgov.com. Most information provided via subscription can be found elsewhere on the site. If you don't want us to have any personally identifiable information, it is your choice not to give it to us.</p>
  <p><b>Online Payments</b><br>
  The use of third-party payment services, such as Western Union, Inc. or Active.com, may require you to enter your credit card information in a secure form. By using these sites, you are authorizing them to collect your account information to process your payment. Each site is secure and protects information you transmit to them using industry-standard encryption. These sites are only affiliated with the City of Tallahassee through payment handling, and this privacy policy does not necessarily apply to them.</p>
      <p><b>Florida Sunshine Law</b><br>
  As a general rule, Talgov.com does not disclose any personally identifiable information collected online except where you have given us permission, or where the information is requested to be disclosed and is public information under the State of Florida statutes or other applicable laws. Visitors to the site should be aware that  Florida Statute 119 declares that it is the policy of this state that all state, county, and municipal records shall be open for personal inspection by any person, and thus information collected by Talgov.com may be subject to examination and inspection upon request, if such information is a public record and not otherwise protected from disclosure by statute.</p>
      <p><b>Links to other sites</b><br>
  Talgov.com contains links to other sites. These sites follow their own privacy policy, and are not bound by this document. Any site outside of the Talgov.com domain is subject to its own guidelines, and should not be viewed as a part of the City's site.</p>
      <p><b>How to contact us</b><br>
  If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, <a href="email.cfm?id=webmaster">feel free to contact us</a> .</p>
