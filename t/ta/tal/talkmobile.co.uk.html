<p class="header3">How your  personal information is used by The Carphone Warehouse Group plc  </p>
<p>When  you place an order with The Carphone Warehouse Group plc, we need to  collect certain information to be able to process your order. What we  need varies depending on the items you have ordered, and the pages  you are asked to complete will vary accordingly. The information is  sent to us via an SSL encrypted server. This information will form  part of a permanent record of your dealings with The Carphone  Warehouse. </p>
<p>When  you email us, we may ask for certain information to be able to check  this record and answer your questions quickly and accurately. When  you contact us, in any way, we may make a note of this contact if it  is relevant to your permanent record. This allows us to provide a  higher level of ongoing customer care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
