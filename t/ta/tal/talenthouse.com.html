				    <h1>Talenthouse Privacy Policy</h1>

				    <div style="height: 1px; background-color: #cccccc; margin: 20px auto 20px auto; width: 400px;" class="clearfix"></div>

				    <p>Effective 7th October 2008</p>

				    <p>Talenthouse provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com">talenthouse.com</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site.  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.  You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.</p>

				    <p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>

				    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

				    <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your membership of Talenthouse (together, the "<strong>Service</strong>") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>

				    <h3>Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>

				    <ul>
				    <li>When you register with us through the Site, as a member of Talenthouse, or when you create your own profile page on the Site we will ask you for certain pieces of personally identifiable information.  This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>").  Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address and home postal addresses.</li><br>&nbsp;

				    <li>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile page (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) ("<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>").</li><br>&nbsp;

				    <li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service and administer your enquiries that you make to Talenthouse.</li><br>&nbsp;

				    <li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.  But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).  We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Talenthouse Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used.   We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to provide an opportunity to you according to your preferences or profile.</li><br>&nbsp;

				    <li>We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with Talenthouse newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "user preferences" information. (See "<strong>Changing or Deleting Information</strong>," below.) </li><br>&nbsp;

				    </ul>

				    <p></p><h3>Log Data</h3>.  When you visit the Site, whether as a Talenthouse member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a "<strong>Talenthouse User</strong>"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("<strong>Log Data</strong>").  This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and information appropriate to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.  We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.<p></p>

				    <h2>Cookies</h2>
				    <p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration username and login password for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Talenthouse Users and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</p>

				    <h2>Emailing Via a Talenthouse Account</h2>
				    <p>As part of the Service, Talenthouse members may communicate with other Talenthouse members and non-registered users through use of their accounts.  Where Talenthouse members have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Talenthouse to those email addresses on their behalf. This email tool only initiates email messages when the Talenthouse member chooses to send a message. These email addresses will be stored in the address book the Talenthouse member creates and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. </p>

				    <h2>Phishing</h2>
				    <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Talenthouse.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account username, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.</p>

				    <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

				    <p></p><h3>Talenthouse Members</h3>.  We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site according to the preferences you set in your account.  Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other Talenthouse Users to know about you.  We recommend that you guard your sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.   Talenthouse may, as part of the Service, enable you to migrate information from your Talenthouse profile page to third party websites, such as social networking environments.  If you choose to avail of this option from Talenthouse, you consent to Talenthouse's sharing and disclosure of such information from your profile page, including your Personal Information, with those third parties.<p></p>

				    <p></p><h3>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h3>.  We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information with, and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data to, third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.<p></p>

				    <p></p><h3>Service Providers</h3>.  We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.<p></p>

				    <p></p><h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>.  Talenthouse cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Talenthouse or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.<p></p>

				    <p></p><h3>Business Transfers</h3>.  Talenthouse may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.  Talenthouse will notify you before transferring your information to a new entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of its assets if the new entity's processing of your information will materially differ from that set forth in this Privacy Policy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.<p></p>

				    <h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
				    <p>All members of Talenthouse may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.  If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record.  See below for privacy contact information.</p>

				    <h2>Security</h2>
				    <p>Talenthouse is very concerned with safeguarding your information.  We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>

				    <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any  breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

				    <h2>International Transfer</h2>
				    <p>Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Talenthouse transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

				    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
				    <p>Our Site may contain links to other websites.  If you choose to click on such a link, you will be directed to that third party's website.  The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

				    <h2>Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
				    <p>This Site is not directed to children under 14. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 14.   If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at Privacy@talenthouse.com.
