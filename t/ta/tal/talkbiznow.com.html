	<strong>Last Updated: 18th August 2008</strong>
										<p>Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>We
												will never rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes</li>
											<li>We will
												never share your contact information with another user, without your consent.</li>
											<li>Any sensitive information that you
												provide will be secured with all industry standard protocols and technology</li>

										</ul>
										<p>Notice of all changes that materially
											affect ways in which your personally identifiable data may be used or shared will be posted in updates, to the
											website, to our Privacy Policy. If you continue to use the Talkbiznow service after notice of changes have been
											sent to you or published on our site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed practices</p>
										<p>Please read this
											privacy policy to learn more about:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>What personally identifiable information of yours does Talkbiznow collect.</li>
											<li>How the information is used.</li>
											<li>With whom the information may be shared.</li>

											<li>How you can access and change your Account information.</li>
											<li>What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of
												information collected by Talkbiznow.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>How to contact us.<br>
											<strong><br>
											Information Collection</strong></p>
										<p><em>Registration</em></p>

										<p>In order to become a Talkbiznow user, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account
											you are required to provide the following contact information: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code,
											a brief summary of your professional background (current occupation &amp; networking objectives), and choose a password.</p>
										<p><em>Profile Information</em></p>
										<p>Once a user, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional
											experiences, and networking objectives. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration
											is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the Talkbiznow
											system.</p>
										<p><em>Information about your Contacts</em></p>
										<p>In order to invite others to connect with you directly in Talkbiznow, you will enter their names and email
											addresses. This information will be used by Talkbiznow to send your invitation including a message that you write.
											The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.</p>

										<p>You
											may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts into the private “My Contacts” section of our website.
											All information entered there will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the Talkbiznow
											network without your permission.<br>
											All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy
											policy as cover your own personally identifiable information.</p>
										<p><em>Cookies &amp; Log Files</em></p>
										<p>Like most web sites, Talkbiznow uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file
											that resides on your computer, which allows Talkbiznow to recognise you as a user when you return to our site
											using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will
											not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and
											log file data is used to customise your experience on the web site.</p>

										<p>One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set
											once you’ve logged in to your Talkbiznow account. The next time
											you visit the Talkbiznow web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognise you as an existing user so
											you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information,
											however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log
											out of the Talkbiznow site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type
											of cookie, called a “session” cookie,
											is used to identify a particular visit to the Talkbiznow site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when
											you close your web browser.</p>
										<p>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Talkbiznow
											web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when
											you leave Talkbiznow. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server
											you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of
											your ISP. This information is used to analyse overall trends to help us improve the Talkbiznow service. The linkage
											between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third parties without
											your permission or except when required by law.</p>
										<p><em>Children</em></p>
										<p>Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal
											information to us or use the service.</p>

										<p><strong>Information Use</strong></p>
										<p>Talkbiznow is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with one
											another. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe
											yourself to other users. </p>
										<p><em>Talkbiznow Communications</em></p>
										<p>Talkbiznow will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website. Please be aware that you
											will always receive certain emails from Talkbiznow related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email
											notices when another user in your network sends you an opportunity. Talkbiznow may send you promotional information
											unless you have opted out of receiving such information. If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails,
											please send a request to <a href="mailto:customerservice@talkbiznow.com">customerservice@talkbiznow.com</a>.</p>
										<p><em>Customised Content</em></p>

										<p>Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customise your experience
											on the web site. For example, when you login to your account we will display the screen names of new users who
											have recently joined your network.</p>
										<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
										<p><em>Sharing Information With Third Parties</em></p>
										<p>Talkbiznow takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide
											your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally
											identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. These third
											parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services
											and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.</p>
										<p>We may provide aggregated
											data about the usage of our services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to
											be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. product managers, managing directors), industry, and geographic
											location, company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities
											on the site, please email customer service.</p>

										<p><em>Partnering with Other Organisations to Offer Combined Services</em></p>
										<p>Talkbiznow partners with other online services to give you the combined results
											of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services it will be your choice to make use of the combined services
											or not. In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from Talkbiznow to the partner
											if you choose to use the combined service.</p>
										<p><em>Communications Between Users</em></p>
										<p>Many emails you initiate through Talkbiznow, an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list your email
											address and name in the header of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about
											your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom you’re directly connected. Other
											communications that you initiate through the Talkbiznow website, like a request for contact, will list your name
											as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be
											shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.</p>
										<p><em>Legal Disclaimer</em></p>
										<p>It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information
											wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding,
											or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

										<p><strong>Accessing
											and Changing Your Account Information</strong></p>
										<p>You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired
											changes to the information, or to the settings for your Talkbiznow account, at any time by logging in to your account
											on the Talkbiznow website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close your account through
											the Talkbiznow website. If you close your Talkbiznow account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable
											information from our publicly viewable data. We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary
											to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable
											data, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the Talkbiznow Privacy
											Policy that you have previously agree to. To request that we close your account and remove your information from
											the Talkbiznow service, please send your request to <a href=",ailto:customerservice@talkbiznow.com">customerservice@talkbiznow.com</a>. Please
											send your request using an email account that you have registered with Talkbiznow under your name. You will receive
											a response to requests sent to <a href="mailto:customerservice@talkbiznow.com">customerservice@talkbiznow.com</a> within twenty business days
											of our receiving it.</p>
										<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
										<p>In order to secure your personal information, access to your data on Talkbiznow is password-protected,
											and sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and our web site.
											To protect any data you store on our servers we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and
											attacks.</p>

										<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
										<p>Talkbiznow may update this privacy policy. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your
											personally identifiable information, we will display a notice on this site. Unless stated otherwise, our current
											Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
										<p><strong>Questions or Comments</strong></p>
										<p>If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@talkbiznow.com">customerservice@talkbiznow.com</a> or contact us at:</p>
