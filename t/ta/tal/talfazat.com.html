        <dt>
            7.   Cookies        </dt>
        <dd>A cookie is a small non-executable file that is stored on your hard drive for the purpose of identifying your computer. While it is possible to navigate and use Talfazat.com by having your browser's Internet security set such that it will not accept cookies, your online experience may be greatly reduced, and you may not be able to access the full functionality of the Talfazat website. </dd>
        <dd>Talfazat only uses session cookies at Talfazat.com. Session cookies are active only during the period you are logged on to the Talfazat.com website, and are removed when you leave. They help us track the sections of the website that you use to allow us to make improvements in keeping with observed user preferences.</dd>
        <dd>Talfazat also allows other companies, called third-party ad-servers or ad-networks, to present advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network's website, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. Talfazat only authorizes our third-party ad-servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access to, any personally identifying information about you.</dd>
        <dd>Third-party ad-servers may use permanent cookies. Permanent cookies remain on your hard drive until you remove them through your browser's Internet security settings. Permanent cookies are used to store user preferences such as preferred language and thus eliminate your having to make the same entries on each visit.</dd>
        <dt>
            8.	Safeguards        </dt>
        <dd>In executing its responsibilities with respect to the confidentiality of personal information, Talfazat will employ a number of safeguards, appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. Such safeguards will include physical measures, organizational measures and technological measures, for example, restricted access to offices, security clearances and limiting access on a "need to know” basis and use of passwords and encryption. Procedures for implementing these measures will be communicated to all employees and third parties to ensure compliance with this principle. </dd>
        <dt>
            9.	Openness and Updates        </dt>
        <dd>Talfazat will make its policies and practices relating to the protection of personal information available to its customers. The information will be available in a format that is easy to understand.</dd>
        <dd>If Talfazat decides to change its privacy policy, it will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places it deems appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how Talfazat uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, Talfazat will disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If Talfazat makes material changes to this policy, it will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on its homepage. <br>
