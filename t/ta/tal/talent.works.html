<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="lead">
Your privacy and trust are critically important to us. At
talentworks we have a few fundamental principles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="lead">
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need
it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your
gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="lead">
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to
comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our
rights.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="lead">
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless
required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">
(Because we loved it so much, we decided to use
<a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>'s
privacy policy under the
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Share-Alike license</a>.
You should check them out. They're good people.)
</p>
<p class="lead">
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
</p>
<p class="lead">
talentworks
<strong>("talentworks")</strong>
operates several websites and applications, including
<a href="/">http://talent.works/</a>.
It is talentworks' policy to respect your privacy regarding any
information we may collect while operating our websites and
applications.
</p>
<p class="lead">
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal
data please contact our
<a href="mailto:hello@talent.works">support team</a>.
</p>
<p class="lead">
Now, all the details—
</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>
Like most website operators, talentworks collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
of each visitor request. talentworks' purpose in collecting
non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
talentworks' visitors use its website. From time to time,
talentworks may release non-personally-identifying information in
the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
of its website.
</p>
<p>
talentworks also collects potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
users and for users logging in via Facebook. talentworks only
discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
information as described below, except that blog commenter IP
addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the
administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
Certain visitors to talentworks' websites choose to interact with
talentworks in ways that require talentworks to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
information that talentworks gathers depends on the nature of the
interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for career advice
at
<a href="/">http://talent.works/</a>
to provide an email address, location and education history.
Those who engage in transactions with talentworks — by
signing up for a guaranteed employment contract, for example
— are asked to provide additional information, including as
necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, talentworks collects
such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
talentworks. talentworks does not disclose personally-identifying
information other than as described below. And visitors can always
refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the
caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
website-related activities.
</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>
talentworks may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors
to its websites. For instance, talentworks may monitor the most
popular colleges on its
<a href="/">http://talent.works/</a>
site or write a blog post about its placement percentages of its
guaranteed employment contracts. talentworks may display this
information publicly or provide it to others. However, talentworks
does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.
</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
talentworks discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
that information in order to process it on talentworks' behalf or
to provide services available at talentworks' websites, and (ii)
that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using talentworks' websites, you
consent to the transfer of such information to them. talentworks
will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
above, talentworks discloses potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information only in response to a
subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when
talentworks believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
necessary to protect the property or rights of talentworks, third
parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an
talentworks website and have supplied your email address,
talentworks may occasionally send you an email to tell you about
new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
with what’s going on with talentworks and our products. We
primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type
of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a
minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email
or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
or to help us support other users. talentworks takes all measures
reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access,
use, alteration or destruction of potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p><h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to
the website each time the visitor returns. talentworks uses
cookies to help talentworks identify and track visitors, their
usage of talentworks website, and their website access
preferences. talentworks visitors who do not wish to have
cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
refuse cookies before using talentworks' websites, with the
drawback that certain features of talentworks' websites may not
function properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>
If talentworks, or substantially all of its assets, were
acquired, or in the unlikely event that talentworks goes out of
business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of
the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer
of talentworks may continue to use your personal information as
set forth in this policy.
</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>
Although most changes are likely to be minor, talentworks may
change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in talentworks'
sole discretion. talentworks encourages visitors to frequently
check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your
continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
