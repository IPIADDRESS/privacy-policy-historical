<b>USE OF INFORMATION</b><br>
Any visitor of the TalentTrove website can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the TalentTrove community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the TalentTrove website and which network of TalentTrove members can see what information.<br>
To provide you with some of the features that the TalentTrove community offers to its members, we may use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified as being interested in joining the TalentTrove community.

<div class="privacysmall">

<b>PERSONAL INFORMATION CONNECT VIA TECHNOLOGY</b><br>
As you navigate the Website, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system.

If you search the TalentTrove community by using a toolbar that TalentTrove, or a third party provides, we may collect Anonymous Information about you automatically, but we will not collect Personal Information.
An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.<br>

Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.<br>
Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within the TalentTrove network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the TalentTrove service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the TalentTrove Newsletter, that are considered part of your TalentTrove account.
