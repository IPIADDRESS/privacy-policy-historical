              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>TangoMe, Inc. dba Tango ("Tango") is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of personal information about our current and prospective members. We take the utmost care in protecting our members\' privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we protect your personal information and use this protection to service your account. Tango stresses its privacy and security standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your personal information.</p>
	      <p>In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our products and services as the "Service." Please read on to learn more about our commitment to your privacy.</p>


              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>Tango collects personally identifiable information only when you voluntarily provide it to us. Personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process for the Service if you choose to register with us.  For registration, you are only required to provide your mobile phone number in order to use the Service.  You may also provide personally identifiable information such as your name and email address, but that is optional.   We use this information to connect you to your friends, family and others on Tango.  Through the Service we will have access to your contact list on the devices you use for the Service and we may use that information to help you Tango with other people.</p>
<p>We do not store the information in your contact list on our servers.</p>

<p>Tango may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as profile information including country of residence, zip code, preferences.   In addition, Tango may collect information about your usage of and interaction with the Service, our products and websites including computer and connection information, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, and traffic to and from our websites.</p>
																				       <h2>How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
               <p>Your privacy is not for sale.  We do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time.  Period. </p>
               <p>We use your personal information only as follow:</p>
	       <ul class="contentList">
<li>To verify your identity;</li>
<li>To connect you with your friends and family on Tango;</li>
<li>To show your name to the person you are Tangoing;</li>
<li>To deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service;</li>
<li>To contact you via email, SMS or otherwise for the purpose of informing you about new products, services or promotions offered by Tango; you can opt-out of such emails or SMSs by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@tango.me">privacy@tango.me</a></li>
<li>For troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;</li>
<li>When we have a good faith belief that the law or any legal process requires disclosure and you hereby consent to such disclosure;</li>
<li>To enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
</ul>

 <h2>Your User Profile </h2>
              <p>The information you enter into your user profile may be shared with your Tango contacts. You control your user profile and you can access your user profile from the profile menu under settings in the Tango App.</p>

<h2>Ownership of Data</h2>
<p>Your data belongs to you, and you can remove it anytime you want. If you ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers. Despite such removal, portions of your data may remain on our production and back-up servers indefinitely.</p>

<p>Any personally identifiable information you submit on a blog, bulletin board or chat room on our website can be viewed and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Tango is not responsible for your disclosure of information in these forums.</p>

<h2>Third Party Collection of Information </h2>
<p>In certain instances, Tango may have contracts with third parties to provide products and/or services in connection with the Service. If you accessed a website, product or service provided by a third party, such third party may also collect information about you. Please see the privacy policies of each such third party for more information about how they use the information they collect.  This Privacy Policy does not govern any exchange of information between you and any third party.</p>

<h2>Opt-Out</h2>
<p>Tango does allow you to choose not to receive promotional communications from Tango and its partners.  Every promotional e-mail sent by Tango or its partners will contain instructions on how to unsubscribe from that particular mailing.</p>

<h2>Security; Data Transfer</h2>
<p>Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top priority for Tango. We make substantial efforts to ensure the privacy of all personally identifiable information you provide to us. Access to all user information is restricted to Tango employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. Tango uses password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality of all user information. Nonetheless, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse or alteration.  In addition, your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Tango maintains facilities, including outside of the United States. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data as described in this Privacy Policy, Tango reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country.  By using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. As Tango continues to develop its business, Tango might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions as well as in the event Tango or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Tango users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.</p>

<h2>Age</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Service, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service.</p>

<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this Privacy Policy. You may review updates to our Privacy Policy at any time via links on our website. You agree to accept electronic communications and/or postings of a revised Privacy Policy on the Tango web site, and you agree that such electronic communications or postings constitute notice to you of the Privacy Policy.  We reserve the right to modify this policy from time to time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by publishing a revised Privacy Policy or by means of a notice on our website. You agree that your continued use of the Service after we publish a revised Privacy Policy or provide a notice on our website constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
