<a name="More_about_our_relationships_with_third_parties"></a><h3>More about our relationships with third parties</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we enter into contracts with third parties who assist us in servicing you such as filling customer orders or providing customer service. The contracts outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit third parties from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service for which they’ve been contracted. Vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or a law enforcement request. We have business partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded.  Partner services and sites are clearly identified. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. This Web site may provide links to third-party sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers.  Because Intuit does not control the information policies or practices of these third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personal information.
</p><p>Should we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any change of control. 
</p><p>We may use sources outside of Intuit to supplement the information you give us. For example, we may validate your address using other sources. We use this data to help us maintain accuracy and provide you with better service.
</p><p>Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange information about your transactions to fulfill your requests.  We may also provide you information about products or services we believe you may be interested in unless you have asked us not to contact you. We offer you the opportunity to review privacy practices at our subsidiaries' Web sites.
