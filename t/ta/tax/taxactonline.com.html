			<h2>Information Collected</h2>
			<p>2nd Story Software will only collect, store, use, and share your personal information (including email address) as it is defined by TaxACTOnline.com's privacy statement and as regulated by state and federal laws. We require personal information such as your email address and full name to register as a member with www.taxactonline.com. We need to obtain your social security number and date of birth to confirm your identity and file your taxes. We also require other sensitive information such as your credit card information to process your order.</p>
			<p>When filing a tax return online, in addition to entering your own personal information, you may be asked to enter personal information of those who are either a joint filer or dependants in the same household. Information collected on the TaxACTonline.com website is stored by 2nd Story Software and, unless it is otherwise stated, is used to prepare and electronically file users tax returns, as well as notify you when new/enhanced products and services become available. We do not disclose user's information (including email address) to third parties except when the user requests to e-file their return. In just case, we will disclose information to the appropriate government officials and financial institutions. We only communicate with users when necessary, such as issues with the user's tax return or to provide requested services.</p>
			<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  2nd Story Software stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
			<p>Your friend may contact us at refer@taxact.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
			<p>Only information you have given us (including email address) is stored by us. We do not supplement your information with information from other companies.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to receive promotional e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending an email to us at the above address or calling us at the above telephone number or writing to us at the above address and telling us that you do not want to receive e-mail from our company.</p>
			<p>Some information, including name and email address is shared with www.taxact.com also owned by 2nd Story Software, Inc. for purposes of notifying you of the release of the next year's online program and potentially other products of interest. If you prefer not to be notified of next year's release or to receive any product information from TaxACT, please contact us via email, phone, fax, or mail to make your request to be removed from our email list. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.taxact.com/privacy_policy.asp">Taxact.com privacy policy</a>.</p>
			<p>You also have the ability to post a testimonial on the website as public information. Personal information is required in order to post these testimonials. Personal information such as your name and email address is collected at the webpage. The webpage default is to keep your personal information private however you will have the ability to opt-in to post your personal information publicly.</p>
			<h2>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>
			<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know the number of emails that have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. <strong>We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information</strong> (including email address). If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Changing and Deleting Personal Information."</p>
			<h2>Changing and Deleting information</h2>
			<p>With regard to tax return information, the user has the option of either mailing or e-filing their tax returns. If the user decides to e-file their tax return, the user will not be able to update their personal information once their tax return has been filed, unless the IRS rejects their return. Users may check if their return has been accepted or rejected by accessing <a href="https://www.taxact.com/secure_ef/efstatus.asp">Check e-File Status</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition, on October 15 of each year, the IRS no longer accepts e-filed returns. On that date, all tax returns are archived and the TaxACT Online system is taken down for re-tooling. The prior year's archived returns are only accessible by the system for importing purposes only and user changes can no longer be made to a tax return after October 15th of the tax filing year.</p>
			<p><strong>If you do not want to receive promotional e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by using one of the contact methods listed at the top of this page. Please make sure you supply the same e-mail address to us that you are receiving the e-mail from. In some cases, e-mail addresses are being forwarded by your ISP to another e-mail address. We must have the one that is listed in the e-mail you receive from us. In addition, users may unsubscribe by replying to the opt-out instructions at the bottom of each email they receive.</strong></p>
			<h2>Security Measures</h2>
			<p>Our primary concern is that your tax return and other personal information (including email address) is private and secure. At 2nd Story Software we use the industry-standard Secure Socket Layers (SSL) protocol which provides data encryption, message integrity, and server authentication when your data is sent to us. When you see a small lock in the bottom right or left corner of your browser window, you know your data is being encrypted for transmission.</p>
			<p>All information (including email address) you enter while using TaxACT Online is used strictly by 2nd Story Software, Inc. to provide the services requested by our customers. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information (including email address). All data is stored on 2nd Story Software servers and is backed up to prevent the loss of data. Electronically filed returns, which are further encrypted, are sent directly from 2nd Story Software to the IRS via a secure connection. Access to (and the use thereof) personally identifiable customer information (including email address) is restricted to authorized personnel and is permitted only when prompted by you, or as dictated by service, support, and/or fulfillment requirements.  <strong>2nd Story Software, Inc. will not sell or rent your name or other personal information (including email address) to any third party in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement. Personally identifiable information (including email address) is only shared with third party intermediaries providing they have been contracted to act on 2nd Story Software's behalf or to carry out a specific function. Under these circumstances, third party intermediaries may not sell or transfer this information nor may they use information for any secondary purpose.</strong></p>
			<h2>Third Party Intermediaries</h2>
			<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information (including email address) for any secondary purposes.</p>
			<p>We use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our website to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. For more information about the technology used to deliver our emails, or how to set your browser to reject cookies, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a>.</p>
			<p>We may use advertising companies to serve advertisements for us on our website. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>) and here (<a href="http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html">http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html</a>) We do not share, rent or sell any personally identifiable information to these companies.</p>
			<p>On occasion, we will enter into a written contract with third party intermediary companies to help us to complete a business process, service, or function on our behalf. Without limitation, third party intermediaries may specialize in providing services such as:  consulting or contracted development and maintenance, temporary workers, data processing, as well as direct and network marketing. These third party intermediaries may not use or retain personally identifiable (including email address) information for any secondary purpose. Additionally, they may not divulge, rent, or sell any information (including email address) that may be gained through their relationship with 2nd Story Software.</p>
			<p>2nd Story Software may also enter into marketing alliances and joint marketing relationships. 2nd Story Software's relationship with these companies shall not represent our endorsement for the products or services these companies offer; and, are only being made available within TaxACTOnline.com to serve as added conveniences for our site's visitors. Unless you have supplied your consent, 2nd Story Software does not share your name and other personally identifiable information (including email address); and, 2nd Story Software shall never sell or rent any information (including email address) that identifies you personally or individually . Otherwise, for a third party intermediary to obtain your contact information or personal data (including email address), you, yourself, will need to supply them with your information or become their direct customer.</p>
			<p>Written agreements are established between 2nd Story Software and all third party intermediaries, as well as joint marketing and alliance companies. Each agreement strictly limits the use of your personally identifiable information (including email address) to the scope of the contract. Contractual agreements, such as these, also stipulate safeguard, handling, and other precautionary care procedures, which are required to be taken. The contractual agreements we have in place and/or establish also govern confidentiality rights by limiting the information that we can share to include only aggregated statistical data.</p>

			<p>TaxactOnline.com may contain links to third-party Web sites. Each of these links shall be clearly identified. 2nd Story Software does not direct or oversee the policies, procedures, or other practices for companies other than 2nd Story. 2nd Story Software does not endorse the products and services that are offered by third party companies. The presence of third party links within TaxACTOnline.com are for convenience purposes only and should not be considered as representing an endorsement by 2nd Story.

			<p>Although we respect and honor your privacy preferences, 2nd Story Software shall maintain and reserve the right to contact you (via email, phone, fax, mail, or otherwise) when it deems appropriate, such as for nonmarketing purposes (such as bug alerts, security breaches, and/or changes that may impact your ability to use TaxACT products and services).  In certain circumstances, we may use our website, newspapers, or other public means to post a notice.</p>
			<h2>Service, Support and Suggestions Section of TaxACT.com</h2>
