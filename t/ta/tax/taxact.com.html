		<h4>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h4>
		<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know the number of emails that have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. <strong>We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</strong> If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Changing and Deleting Personal Information" below.</p>
		<h4>Third Party Intermediaries</h4>
		<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
		<p>We use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our Web site to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. For more information about the technology used to deliver our emails, or how to set your browser to reject cookies, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a>.</p>
		<p>We may use advertising companies to serve advertisements for or on our Web site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or Web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>) and here (<a href="http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html">http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html</a>).  We do not share, rent or sell any personally identifiable information (including email address) to these companies.</p>
		<p>On occasion, we will enter into a written contract with third party intermediary companies to help us to complete a business process, service, or function on our behalf. Without limitation, third party intermediaries may specialize in providing services such as:  consulting or contracted development and maintenance, temporary workers, data processing, as well as direct and network marketing. These third party intermediaries may not use or retain personally identifiable information (including email address) for any secondary purpose.  Additionally, they may not divulge, rent or sell any information (including email address) that may be gained through their relationship with 2nd Story Software.</p>

		<p>Written agreements are established between 2nd Story Software and all third party intermediaries, as well as joint marketing and alliance companies. Each agreement strictly limits the use of your personally identifiable information to the scope of the contract. Contractual agreements, such as these, also stipulate safeguard, handling, and other precautionary care procedures, which are required to be taken.

		<h4>Security Measures</h4>
		<p>Our primary concern is that your personal information is private and secure. At 2nd Story Software we use the industry-standard Secure Socket Layers (SSL) protocol which provides data encryption, message integrity, and server authentication when your data is sent to us. When you see a small lock in the bottom right or left corner of your browser window, you know your data is being encrypted for transmission.</p>
		<p>All information you enter while using TaxACT is used strictly by 2nd Story Software, Inc. to provide the services requested by our customers. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law and federal standards. All data is stored on 2nd Story Software servers and is backed up to prevent the loss of data. Electronically filed returns, which are further encrypted, are sent directly from 2nd Story Software to the IRS via a secure connection. Access to (and the use thereof) personally identifiable customer information (including email address) is restricted to authorized personnel and is permitted only when prompted by you, or as dictated by service, support, and/or fulfillment requirements. <strong>2nd Story Software, Inc. will not sell or rent your name or other personal information (including email address) to any third party in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement. Personally identifiable information (including email address) is only shared with third party intermediaries providing they have been contracted to act on 2nd Story Software's behalf or to carry out a specific function. Under these circumstances, third party intermediaries may not sell or transfer this information (including email address) nor may they use information for any secondary purpose.</strong></p>
		<h4>Notices and Service Alerts</h4>
		<p>Although we respect and honor your privacy preferences, 2nd Story Software shall maintain and reserve the right to contact you (via email, phone, fax, mail, or otherwise) when it deems appropriate, such as for nonmarketing purposes (such as bug alerts, security breaches, and/or changes that may impact your ability to use TaxACT products and services).  In certain circumstances, we may use our Web site, newspapers, or other public means to post a notice.</p>
		<h4>Service, Support and Suggestions</h4>
		<p>2nd Story Software offers technical support and customer service on the TaxACT product line to our customers. You may choose to submit a question through the service and support section of the TaxACT.com Web site or contact our support staff directly. The information submitted via the service and support section (including email address) is not stored or shared with third parties, affiliates, alliance or joint marketing companies, or any other third party intermediaries.

		<p>If you make a suggestion using the service and support section of our Web site, the suggestion alone may be stored, but no personal data  (including email address) will be stored with the suggestion. 2nd Story Software, Inc. does retain the right to use your suggestions and product enhancement ideas to improve the TaxACT Web sites and product line without obligation to you.</p>
		<h4>Affiliate Program</h4>
		<p>TaxACT.com offers an affiliate program to broaden its marketing reach. Affiliate sites may register with TaxACT.com to sell the TaxACT product line. All information collected from the affiliate (including email address) is used to apply proper credit to the affiliate's sales, contact the affiliate if products and offers change, and to make payment to the affiliate for their sales commissions. No information (including email address) supplied by an affiliate is shared or sold to a third party.</p>
		<h4>Use of Log Files and Cookies</h4>
		<p>Like most Web servers, 2nd Story Software relies on log files. Log files include: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), number of page views, platform type, date and time stamps, as well as the number visitors to our Web site. This information is used by 2nd Story Software to administer the site, analyze trends, track aggregated user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregated use only. Our Web site also uses tracking software which enables us to anonymously analyze trends occurring on our Web site. Personally identifiable information (including email address) is not stored, as the software does not collect personal information such as name, age, phone number, mailing address, email address or credit card numbers from visitors. For each visitor to our Web page, the software automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, IP address, access times, and pages viewed. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information (including email address).</p>
		<p>TaxACT.com employs the use of cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information (including email address) while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. If users reject the cookie, they will not be able to purchase products from the TaxACT.com Web site.</p>
		<h4>General Disclosure of Aggregated Information</h4>
		<p>2nd Story Software may disclose aggregate information to the IRS or other parties; however, we will not represent any information, which may be used to identify you personally or individually (including email address) without your expressed consent. Examples may include, but are not limited to:  the total number of users served by a TaxACT product/service, general age group ratios, and other statistical data relating to tax preparation and electronic filing service.</p>
		<h4>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>
		<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
		<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information (including email address) in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days.</p>
		<p>If we merge with, or are acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use the Personal Information you have provided as described in this policy. If we cease operation, your Personal Information may be transferred to and used by another company that offers similar or related products or services. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
		<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
		<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
