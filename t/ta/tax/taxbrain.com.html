        Information Collection</p>
      <p class="content">Petz Enterprises, Inc. is the sole owner of the information 
        collected on TaxBrain.com. TaxBrain collects information from our users 
        at several different points on our Web site.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Registration</p>
      <p class="content">In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete 
        the registration form. During registration a user is required to give 
        contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. 
        We use this information to contact the user about services on our site 
        for which they have expressed interest. </p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Order Information</p>
      <p class="content">We request information from users on our order form. 
        A user must provide contact information such as name, email, address and 
        phone number and financial information such as credit card number, expiration 
        date and bank account information. All financial information collected 
        on our site will remain absolutely confidential and will never be disclosed 
        to any non-affiliated companies except as required by law. Financial information 
        includes information such as credit card numbers and bank account information. 
        We may store such information on our secure servers to expedite processing 
        of certain services and products we provide to you. We may use your contact 
        information to notify you of important product updates, significant tax 
        law changes or promotional opportunities – if you have chosen to 
        receive such offers.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Tax Related Information</p>
      <p class="content">When a tax return is prepared on TaxBrain the information 
        contained in the tax return will be treated with extreme care and confidence. 
        As a method for detecting fraud in tax information transmitted via the 
        Internet, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Petz Enterprises 
        to provide to the IRS, in connection with the electronic filing of tax 
        returns, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which 
        the return originated. We are also required to notify the IRS whether 
        the e-mail address of the person electronically filing the return has 
        been collected. </p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Tax Estimator and W-4 Calculator</p>
      <p class="content">Information entered into the Tax Estimator and W-4 
        Calculator is used solely to provide tax estimates and does not collect 
        personally identifiable information. The information that you provide 
        is not saved or transferred to any other party.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Identifying and Contact Information</p>
      <p class="content">From time to time, users may be asked to provide certain 
        Identifying and Contact Information, such as name, e-mail address, mailing 
        address, telephone number, user name, and demographic information. This 
        information is used to verify identity, determine eligibility for special 
        programs or services we may offer and complete transactions. At times 
        it will be necessary to use Contact Information to communicate with users 
        concerning administrative matters, responding to user requests and notifying 
        users of the status of their transactions. However, we will not disclose 
        Identifying and Contact Information to third parties without prior consent, 
        except as required by law.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Contest/Promotions and Surveys</p>
      <p class="content">At times we will administer contests and online surveys 
        where we will ask for contact information, such as e-mail address and 
        demographic information, such as zip code, age or income level. The reason 
        the information is being collected will be disclosed with the contest 
        or survey at the time the information is collected.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Public Forums</p>
      <p class="content">This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, 
        and/or news groups available. Information disclosed in these areas becomes 
        public information. Caution should be exercised when disclosing personal 
        information in these applications.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Profile</p>
      <p class="content">We store information that we collect through forms 
        and cookies to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information 
        we keep that supplies us with details of viewing preferences. Consequently, 
        collected information is tied to the users’ personally identifiable 
        information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for 
        the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web 
        site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. Profiles could 
        be shared with third parties in aggregate form only.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Cookies</p>
      <p class="content">A "cookie" is a small piece of information 
        that our Web sites may provide to a user’s browser while they are 
        at our site. Registered users on TaxBrain will receive a cookie when they 
        login. This cookie is maintained by their browser and contains their unique 
        identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate their identity and 
        provide access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered 
        users, such as those for tax return preparation and electronic filing. 
        The cookie is tied to the user’s account id. Only TaxBrain knows 
        what personal information matches the account id number. There is no way 
        any personally identifiable information could be directly extracted from 
        our cookie. However, if a user has opted to have their username and password 
        remembered, the information is stored in the cookie.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Log Files </p>
      <p class="content">Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. 
        With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such 
        as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider 
        (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number 
        of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement 
        in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
        use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 
        We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate 
        so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information 
        is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. 
        We store log information that we collect to create a profile of our users.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Communications from the Site</p>
      <p class="contentTitle"><br>
        Special Offers and Updates</p>
      <p class="content">We send all new members a welcoming email to verify 
        registration. Established members will occasionally receive information 
        on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Newsletter</p>
      <p class="content">If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we 
        ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect 
        for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. 
        Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Service Announcements</p>
      <p class="content">On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly 
        service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily 
        suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users 
        may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their 
        account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 
      </p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Customer Service</p>
      <p class="content">We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide 
        requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account 
        we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the your wishes.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle"> Information Sharing</p>
      <p class="content">Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, 
        we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein 
        we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with 
        a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on 
        our Web site.<br>
        Our site does link to other sites in order to provide all of the tax and 
        financial services users might need. PEI has partnered with these sites 
        for content use and may share user information disclosed on our site with 
        them on an aggregate basis for advertisement tracking only. We will never 
        disclose personally Identifying information without prior consent. TaxBrain 
        provides services in conjunction with third party companies. With your 
        permission, your TaxBrain account will have the ability to log into accounts, 
        and upload information to your TaxBrain account, that you hold with third 
        party partners. This upload of information to TaxBrain.com is done to 
        fulfill the full service of our site and no other purpose. For example, 
        we can upload W-2s from employers and other content for forms from our 
        partner organizations.</p>
      <p class="content">These are the instances in which we will share users’ 
        personal information</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="contentTitle">Third Party Intermediaries</p>
        <p class="content">We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, 
          and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
          These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
          information for any secondary purposes.</p>
        <p class="contentTitle">Service Providers</p>
        <p class="content">We partner with other third party banks, such as 
          the Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust, to provide specific financial services. 
          When users sign up for these particular services, we share names, or 
          other contact information (such as name, address, social security number 
          and phone number) that is necessary for the third party to provide these 
          services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable 
          information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
        <p class="contentTitle">Business Transitions</p>
        <p class="content">In the event TaxBrain goes through a business transition, 
          such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion 
          of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, 
          be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email 
          and prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of 
          ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of 
          the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information 
          will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
          they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes 
          section.</p>
        <p class="contentTitle">Choice/Opt-out</p>
        <p class="content">Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter 
          and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications 
          by clicking the link that will be supplied with each e-mail. </p>
        <p class="contentTitle">Links</p>
        <p class="content">This Web site contains links to other sites. Please 
          be aware that we, Petz Enterprises Inc., are not responsible for the

        <p class="content">From time to time our site requests information from 
          users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests 
          is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether 
          or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically 
          includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and 
          demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will 
          be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will 
          be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction 
          of this site. Users’ personally identifiable information is not 
          shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though 
          we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they 
          may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any 
          secondary purposes. </p>

        online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
        off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive 
        information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees 
        who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing 
        clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
        identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected computers. 
        Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy 
        practices. Every [quarter], as well as any time new policies are added, 
        our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place 
        on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information 
        is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable 
        information are in a secure environment, behind a locked door in a locked 
        facility. </p>
      <p class="content">If users have any questions about the security at our 
        Web site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@taxbrain.com">support@taxbrain.com</a>.</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating 
        Personal Information</p>
      <p class="content">We provide the opportunity to update or correct the 
        contact and tax return information provided to us. The tax return information 
        and personally identifiable information collected through this site is 
        contained in tax returns and in product registration information. Once 
        a tax return has been completed using the TaxBrain Web product, and directed 
        that it be electronically filed, it cannot be changed because the tax 
        return has become a legal record of the tax filing. Any changes made to 
        a tax return after it has already been electronically filed, and acknowledged 
        by the IRS, will generate a Form 1040X (amended return).</p>
      <p class="contentTitle">Notification of Changes</p>
      <p class="content">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will 
        post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other 
        places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information 
        we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose 
        it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
        which the information was collected. </p>
      <p class="content">If, however, we are going to use users’ personally 
        identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the 
        time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice 
        as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 
        However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or 
        deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor 
        will their personal information be used in this new manner. </p>
