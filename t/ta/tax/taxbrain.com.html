			  <br>
			  TaxBrain account information is password-protected so that only the registered owner of an account will have access to their personal information. Account information may be updated by entering a user name and password to gain access to the account. We strongly recommend that users do not share their user name and password with anyone. PEI will never ask a user for their user name or password via unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Security is of utmost importance to Petz Enterprises and we use the latest SSL technology to protect confidential information.
			  <br>
			  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected computers. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked door in a locked facility. If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@taxbrain.com">support@taxbrain.com</a> .

                <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We provide the opportunity to update or correct the contact and tax return information provided to us. Users can update their information at any time by logging into myTaxBrain and accessing their return file or account information page. The tax return information and personally identifiable information collected through this site is contained in tax returns and in product registration information. Once a tax return has been completed using the TaxBrain Web product, and directed that it be electronically filed, it cannot be changed because the tax return has become a legal record of the tax filing. Any changes made to a tax return after it has already been electronically filed, and acknowledged by the IRS, will generate a Form 1040X (amended return).<br>

                <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p> 
                <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><br> 
                If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.
