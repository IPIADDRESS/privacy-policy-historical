      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the
      ability to provide a significant amount of information with a few simple
      mouse clicks. With these abilities, numerous individuals and companies
      have developed methods to capture and retain information regarding their
      website visitors. In many cases, the website visitor is not even aware
      that this information is being captured. It is important to TaxResources
      to help our members retain their privacy when they take advantage of all
      the Internet has to offer.<br>
      <br>
      To protect your privacy, TaxResources, Inc. follows five principles in
      accordance with worldwide practices for member privacy and data
      protection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 1 – NOTICE OF INTENT</b><br>
      When we need information that personally identifies you (Personal
      Information) or allows us to contact you, we will ask you for it.
      Generally this information is requested when you are placing an order for
      either a new or renewal membership, requesting tax advice, downloading
      free software, requesting information on free products or merchandise,
      accessing our limited-access members-only site, or purchasing any other
      product or service from us. We use your Personal Information for five
      primary purposes:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To make the site easier for you to use
          by not having to enter information more than once.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To help you quickly find services or
          information on the TaxResources websites.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To help us create content more relevant
          to you.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To gather the information required to
          provide the requested services.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To alert you to additional products and
          services, renewal information, special offers, updated information and
          other new services available from TaxResources.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">PRINCIPLE 2 – CONSENT TO USE</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
      If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can
      still use the non-member portions of the TaxResources websites. But you
      will not be able to access areas that require registration. You will be
      able to provide this same information via telephone, fax, or mail if you
      prefer.<br>
      <br>
      If you decide to register, you will be able to select which services you
      wish to receive from TaxResources. We request information from the user on
      our order forms. The user must provide contact information (name, spouse
      information, mailing address, telephone numbers) and financial information
      (credit card number, expiration date, billing address). This information
      is used for billing and membership registration purposes. If we have
      trouble processing your order, this contact information is used to get in
      touch with the user.<br>
      <br>
      TaxResources has a policy of not soliciting their membership with the
      exception of renewal mailings or other offerings that may accompany the
      quarterly TaxBulletin. When a renewal is due, we may contact the member
      via telephone, email, and postal mail in order to verify the member’s
      intent regarding the renewal billing. We also periodically ask members to
      verify their satisfaction with the services provided particularly after
      the conclusion of an audit.<br>
      <br>
      TaxResources, Inc. has a long-standing policy of not providing personal
      information to any third parties. It is not necessary to request that
      TaxResources, Inc. not allow access by third parties to your personal
      information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 3 – ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
      We will provide you with the means to ensure your personal information is
      correct and current. You may review and update this information at any
      time at the Member Center. The Member Center provides access to various
      types of information and in addition provides you the ability to:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">View and edit personal information you
          have already given us.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Renew your membership.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Report the receipt of an audit notice.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Request responses to tax questions that
          you may have.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial"><font size="2">PRINCIPLE 4 – SECURITY POLICY</font></font></b><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><br>
      TaxResources, Inc. strictly protects the security of your personal
      information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully
      protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure,
      alteration, or destruction.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>This website takes every precaution to protect our members’
      information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your
      information is protected both online and off-line.<br>
      <br>
      When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a
      credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with
      the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure
      page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
      such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked,
      as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.<br>
      <br>
      While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we
      also do everything in our power to protect member information off-line.
      All of our members’ information, not just the sensitive information
      mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
      information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a
      customer service representative) are granted access to personally
      identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected
      workstations to gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL
      employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our
      employees are notified and/or reminded routinely about the importance we
      place on privacy, and what they need to do to ensure our members’
      information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally
      identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment behind
      industry standard firewalls.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the nature of the services we offer, we often receive
      confidential tax information relating to our members. We restrict the
      access to that information to individuals that are licensed to practice
      before the Internal Revenue Service and are covered under Treasury
      Department Circular 230 and the various laws and regulations regarding
      attorney-client privilege and the protection of confidential tax
      information. Email and other correspondence directed to the Audit and
      Technical Division (such as tax advice questions and tax returns) are only
      accessed by such individuals and are not disseminated to nonqualified
      individuals.<br>
      <br>
      It is important for our members to remember that in order to keep your
      privilege regarding this information, you can only talk to individuals
      that qualify for this privilege. Do not discuss these issues with any
      customer service or sales personnel of this or any other company. Do not
      discuss these issues with friends or relatives other than your spouse (in
      most states). Note: Information you discuss with anyone that is directly
      or indirectly related to the preparation of your tax return is
      specifically not covered by the attorney-client privilege.<br>
      <br>
      <u>We will never release any information that is covered under
      attorney-client privilege</u>. However, if TaxResources, Inc. should be
      presented with a subpoena or other government order, we will cooperate and
      provide only the relevant information that is not covered under the
      attorney-client privilege.<br>
      <br>
      If you have any questions about the security at our website or within our
      company, you can send an email to </font><a href="mailto:security@taxaudit.com"><font size="2">security@taxaudit.com</font></a><font size="2">
      .<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 5 – ENFORCEMENT OF PRIVACY POLICIES</b><br>
      If for some reason you believe TaxResources, Inc. has not adhered to these
      principles, please notify us by e-mail at </font><a href="mailto:homepage@taxaudit.com?subject=Privacy Policy"><font size="2">homepage@taxaudit.com</font></a><font size="2">,
      and we will do our best to investigate and correct the problem promptly.
      Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
      Every member has a unique member record. Each record is assigned a unique
      Membership Identification Number, which helps us ensure that only you and
      authorized TaxResources personnel can access your personal information. In
      addition to traditional methods of contact, this information can be
      accessed in the Member Center of our website.<br>
      <br>
      In order to access the Member Center, you will need to have your
      Membership ID Number and the password assigned by TaxResources, Inc. This
      information will be provided to you when you initially become a member,
      when you receive a renewal notice, and when your membership renewal has
      been processed. If you lose your password or your password has become
      compromised, you will need to contact TaxResources and a new password will
      be issued to you. Because of security issues, the password can only be
      sent to either the last known address or the last known email address,
      without a written request.<br>
      <br>
      <b>COOKIES<br>
      </b>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive
      containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way
      linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once
      the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user
      rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. This site does not use
      cookies whatsoever.<br>
      <br>
      <b>LOG FILES</b><br>
      We use IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to analyze trends, administer the
      site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information
      for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
      information.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>REFER A FRIEND</b><br>
      If a member elects to use our referral service for informing a friend
      about our site, we ask the member for the friend’s name and email
      address and the member’s name. TaxResources, Inc. will automatically
      send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.
      TaxResources stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this
      one-time email. The friend may contact TaxResources to request the removal
      of this information from our database.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SHARING OF INFORMATION<br>
      </b>We periodically use an outside shipping company to mail newsletters
      and other items. These companies do not have access to any financial
      information and are not allowed to retain, store, or use personally
      identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
      <br>
      We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user
      signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact
      information that is necessary for the third party to provide these
      services.<br>
      <br>
      These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information
      except for the purpose of providing these services.<br>
      <br>
      <b>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES<br>
      </b>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [TaxResources,
      Inc.] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
      We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website, to read
      the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally
      identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
      information collected by TaxResources websites.<br>
      <br>
      <b>NOTIFICATION OF PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</b><br>
      In the unlikely event that we decide to change our privacy policy, we will
      post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what
      information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if
      any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally
      identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
      time it was collected, we will notify members by way of an email. <u>Members
      will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this
      different manner</u>. We will use information in accordance with the
      privacy policy under which the information was collected.<br>
