	                    <h2>PRINCIPLE 2 — IDENTIFYING PURPOSE</h2> 
	                    <p>
		                    <em>TaxResources, Inc. will identify the purpose for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected. The purposes for which information is collected, used or disclosed by TaxResources, Inc. must be those that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.</em>
	                    </p>

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>2.1</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. will document the purposes for which personal information is collected in order to comply with the Openness requirement (See Principle 8) and the Individual Access requirement (See Principle 9).
	                    </p>  

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>2.2</strong> &nbsp;Identifying the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time of collection allows TaxResources, Inc. to determine the information it needs to collect to fulfill these purposes. The Limiting Collection requirement (See Principle 4) requires TaxResources, Inc. to collect only that information necessary for the purposes that have been identified.
	                    </p> 

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>2.3</strong> &nbsp;The identified purposes for which personal information is collected shall be specified at or before the time of collection to the customer from whom the personal information is collected. Depending upon the way in which the information is collected, this shall be done orally or in writing.
	                    </p> 

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>2.4</strong> &nbsp;When TaxResources, Inc. proposes to use personal information that has been collected for a purpose not previously identified, it will identify the new purpose before using such personal information. Unless the new purpose is required by law, or consent is otherwise not required pursuant to privacy legislation, the consent of the individual shall be obtained before the personal information is used for the new purpose.
	                    </p>  

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>2.5</strong> &nbsp;Individuals responsible for collecting personal information on behalf of TaxResources, Inc. will explain to customers the purposes for which the information is being collected, including any purposes that may not be immediately obvious to the individual.
	                    </p>  

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>2.6</strong> &nbsp;The purposes for which the personal information of customers is collected may include, but is not limited to:<br>
		                    </p><ul>
			                    <li>processing commercial transactions;</li>
			                    <li>communicating with customers;</li>
			                    <li>establishing and maintaining commercial relations;</li>
			                    <li>developing, marketing or providing products and services;</li>
			                    <li>recommending particular products and services;</li>
			                    <li>conducting market research and surveys;</li>
			                    <li>managing and developing business opportunities;</li>
			                    <li>conducting investigations and complaint resolution processes;</li>
			                    <li>facilitating transactional due diligence reviews;</li>
			                    <li>complying with legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
		                    </ul>
		                    <strong>2.7</strong> &nbsp;Anonymous or “non–personal” information gathered by TaxResources, Inc. through its website may be used for technical, research and analytical purposes.

	                    <h2>PRINCIPLE 3 — CONSENT</h2> 
	                    <p>
		                    <em>The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except where consent is not required by privacy legislation as, for example, where the collection, use or disclosure of personal information is solely for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes.</em>
	                    </p>

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.1</strong> &nbsp;Consent is required for the collection of personal information and the subsequent use or disclosure of this information. Generally, TaxResources, Inc. will seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to the use or disclosure of personal information may be sought after the information has been collected but before the personal information is used (for example, when TaxResources, Inc. wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified). In obtaining consent, TaxResources, Inc. shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that a customer is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer.
	                    </p>
	
	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.2</strong> &nbsp;In certain circumstances personal information may be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, TaxResources, Inc. may collect or use personal information without the knowledge or consent of its customers if the collection or use of personal information is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the individual is a minor, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated or if seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal, state or provincial law. Personal information may also be used or disclosed without the knowledge or consent of the individual in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened. TaxResources, Inc. may disclose personal information without knowledge or consent to a lawyer representing the company, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise required by law.
	                    </p>
	
	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.3</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes.
	                    </p>  

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.4</strong> &nbsp;In obtaining consent, TaxResources, Inc. will take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of its customers. Consent will not be obtained through deception.
	                    </p> 

	                    <p>For example:<br>
		                    </p><ul>
			                    <li>A viewer who browses website tax or marketing content online from a TaxResources, Inc. website, would reasonably expect that his or her relevant contact information (name, phone number, personal identification) would be collected and used to identify the viewer for purposes of website functionality. However, this same viewer would not reasonably expect that this information would be used for a purpose other than the administration of the website, without the viewer’s knowledge and consent.</li>
			                    <li>A member would reasonably expect that TaxResources, Inc., in addition to using the individual’s name and address for mailing and billing purposes, would also contact the member to solicit the renewal of his or her membership.</li>
		                    </ul>
	                    <p></p>
    
	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.5</strong> &nbsp;The way in which TaxResources, Inc. seeks consent may vary, depending on the circumstances and the type of information collected. TaxResources, Inc. will generally seek express consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive. It will rely on implied consent only where collection and use of the personal information is directly related to a transaction or exchange of information in which the individual is directly participating. Consent may also be given by an authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney).
	                    </p>  

	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.6</strong> &nbsp;Consent may be obtained in any one of the following ways:<br>
		                    </p><ul>
			                    <li>an application form may be used to seek consent, collect information and inform the individual of the use that will be made of the information. By completing and signing the form, the individual is giving consent to the collection and the specified uses.</li>
			                    <li>a check–off box may be used to allow individuals to request that their names and addresses not be given to other organizations. Individuals who do not check the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of their information to third parties;</li>
			                    <li>if a customer chooses not to register or provide personal information via TaxResources’ website they may give the information and consent orally over the telephone; or</li>
			                    <li>consent may be given at the time that individuals use a product or service.</li>
		                    </ul>
	                    <p></p>
	
	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.7</strong> &nbsp;Generally, the use of products and services by a customer constitutes implied consent for TaxResources, Inc. to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified purposes.
	                    </p>
	
	                    <p>
		                    <strong>3.8</strong> &nbsp;An individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. TaxResources, Inc. will inform individuals of the implications of withdrawing consent. Customers may contact TaxResources, Inc. for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.

The extent to which personal information will be accurate, complete and up–to–date will depend upon the use of the information, taking into account the interests of the individual.</p>  
	                    <p><strong>6.2</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. will not, however, routinely update personal information, unless this is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected.

	                    <h2>7 — SAFEGUARDS</h2>
	                    <p><em>Personal information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</em></p>  

	                    <p><strong>7.1</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. will implement security safeguards to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format in which the information is held.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>7.2</strong> &nbsp;The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on (i) the sensitivity of the information that has been collected, (ii) the amount, distribution and format of the information, and (iii) the method of storage.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>7.3</strong> &nbsp;Physical measures such as locked filing cabinets and restricted access to offices, organizational measures such as security clearances and limiting access on a “need–to–know” basis, and technological measures such as the use of passwords and encryption have been adopted by TaxResources, Inc. in accordance with the standards and procedures defined by the Information Security Department.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>7.4</strong> &nbsp;The use of cookies, web bugs, images, and other techniques to covertly gather information about individuals who use the Internet is incompatible with this policy. Whenever TaxResources, Inc. gathers information about individuals, these same subjects must have agreed upon the collection effort in advance. For this same reason, TaxResources, Inc. does not deposit cookie files on individual hard drives and does not perform any other covert recording of the Internet activity in which individuals have engaged.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>7.5</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. streamlines and expedites all of its computerized business interactions with individuals, but at the same time is to be forthright and clear about its privacy policies. To support these objectives and to encourage individuals to use Internet commerce sites and other computerized business systems, TaxResources, Inc. adopts and supports all generally–accepted standards for web content rating, web site privacy protection, and Internet commerce security, including third–party seals of approval.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>7.6</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. does not use externally–meaningful identifiers as its own internal individual account numbers. For example, to prevent identity theft, TaxResources, Inc. customer account numbers must never be equivalent to social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, or any other identifier that might be used in an unauthorized fashion by a third party.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>7.7</strong> &nbsp;When they are no longer needed, all copies of personal data, including those on backup tapes, must be irreversibly destroyed according to standards and procedures defined by the Information Security Department. A document describing the personal data destroyed and the reasons for such destruction must be prepared for each destruction process. Documents will be destroyed only if all legal retention requirements and related business purposes have been met.</p> 

	                    <p><strong>7.8</strong> &nbsp;A documented risk assessment must be prepared to determine the privacy implications of all significantly new or different uses of personal data. Such a risk assessment must be completed before these uses take place, and must include all steps in the proposed processing, including access, storage, transmission, and destruction. Such a risk assessment must include not only consideration of the risks, but also the security measures to be employed such as access controls, encryption, logs, data retention schedules, and data destruction procedures.</p>

	                    <p><strong>9.1</strong> &nbsp;Upon request, TaxResources, Inc. shall inform an individual customer whether it holds personal information about that individual (except where permitted or required by law not to disclose personal information) and shall afford the individual a reasonable opportunity to review the personal information in his or her file at minimal or no cost to the individual. TaxResources, Inc. shall provide an account of the use that has been made or is being made of the personal information and an account of the third parties to which the personal information has been disclosed. Where reasonably possible, TaxResources, Inc. shall indicate the source of the personal information.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>9.2</strong> &nbsp;In order to safeguard personal information, a customer may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit TaxResources, Inc. to account for the existence, use and disclosure of personal information and to authorize access to the individual–s file. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>9.3</strong> &nbsp;In certain situations, TaxResources, Inc. may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information that they hold about a customer. For example, TaxResources, Inc. is not required to provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual. Similarly, TaxResources, Inc. may not be required to provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal, state or provincial law. If access to personal information cannot be provided, TaxResources, Inc. shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>9.4</strong> &nbsp;In providing an account of third parties to which it has disclosed personal information about a customer, TaxResources, Inc. shall attempt to be as specific as possible. When it is not possible to provide a list of the organizations to which it has actually disclosed personal information, TaxResources, Inc. shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed personal information about the customer.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>9.5</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. will respond to an individual’s request within a reasonable time and in any event within thirty (30) days of the request. The time for responding to a request may be extended for up to an additional thirty (30) days if meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with the activities of TaxResources, Inc., or if the time required to undertake any consultations necessary to respond to the request would make the time limit impracticable to meet. TaxResources, Inc. may also extend the time for responding for such period of time as is necessary to be able to convert the personal information into an alternative format. TaxResources, Inc. will provide notice to the individual of any extension taken within thirty (30) days of the individual’s request and will advise the individual of the right to make a complaint to the Chief Information Security Officer about the extension. They will provide the requested information or make it available in a form that is generally understandable. For example, if abbreviations or codes are used to record information, TaxResources, Inc. will provide a corresponding explanation.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>9.6</strong> &nbsp;Upon request by an individual with sensory disabilities, TaxResources, Inc. will give access to personal information about the individual in an alternative format if a version of the information already exists in that format or if its conversion to an alternative format is necessary to allow the individual to exercise rights to request correction, challenge compliance of TaxResources, Inc. under the Challenging Compliance Requirement (See principle 10) or file a formal complaint pursuant to applicable privacy legislation.</p>  

	                    <p><strong>9.7</strong> &nbsp;TaxResources, Inc. shall promptly correct or complete any personal information found to be inaccurate or incomplete.
