                            As a service to our customers, we have installed links to various tax agencies/services.
                            &nbsp; These include IRS.Gov, and various state agencies and organizations. The
                            links provided are maintained by these separate entities and are not the property

                        <p>
                            We take every step available to safeguard customer information. All forms accepting
                            user information are processed on our secure servers.

                            TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most in the fact that you
                            download our software and install it on your personal PC or you may file your return
                            on a Web based page. Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you
                            are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website. In both the download
                            and the web versions, the tax return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection.
                            Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved
                            to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted intervention. They
                            are again moved a third time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are handled
                            by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements can also be retrieved
                            via our website again without general information provided. (Example: IRS accepted
                            or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) Confidential information such as refund amounts,
                            names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed or e-mailed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by the IRS will be deleted.

                            We strive to keep our customer information as accurate and complete as we can. If
                            you believe any of the information about you is not accurate, please let us know.
