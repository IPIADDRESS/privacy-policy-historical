                  <p><strong>Links</strong> 
                  </p><p>As a service to our customers, we have installed links to

                    Tax Advisors, and various state agencies and organizations. 
                    The links provided are maintained by these separate entities

                  </p><p><strong>Our Former Customers</strong> </p>
                  <p>Even if you are no longer a TaxSlayer customer, our Privacy 
                    Policy will continue to apply to you. </p>
                  <p><strong>Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy</strong> 
                  </p>
                  <p>We take every step available to safeguard customer information. 
                    All forms accepting user information are processed on our 
                    secure servers. </p>
                  <p>TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most 
                    in the fact that you download our software and install it 
                    on your personal PC or you may file your return on a Web based 
                    page. Once you have completed the return on your personal 
                    PC, you are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure 
                    website. In both the download and the web versions, the tax 
                    return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection. 
                    Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's 
                    website, they are moved to a different location providing 
                    less likelihood of unwanted intervention. They are again moved 
                    a third time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are 
                    handled by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements 
                    can also be retrieved via our website again without general 
                    information provided. (Example: IRS accepted or rejected, 
                    acceptance date, etc.) Confidential information such as refund 
                    amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed 
                    or e-mailed. </p>
                  <p>Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by 
                    the IRS will be deleted. </p>
                  <p>Upon deletion of any return, while online, will cause all 
                    information on that return to be deleted. </p>
                  <p>We strive to keep our customer information as accurate and 
                    complete as we can. If you believe any of the information 
                    about you is not accurate, please let us know. </p>
