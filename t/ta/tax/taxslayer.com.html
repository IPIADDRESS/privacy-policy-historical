                In some cases, we employ service providers to provide a product you order, to fulfill

            TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most in the fact that you
            download our software and install it on your personal PC or you may file your return
            on a Web based page. Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you
            are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website. In both the download
            and the web versions, the tax return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection.
            Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved
            to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted intervention. They
            are again moved a third time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are handled
            by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements can also be retrieved
            via our website again without general information provided. (Example: IRS accepted
            or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) TaxSlayer will not issue a refund for returns
            rejected by the IRS or any state agency. Confidential information such as refund
            amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed or e-mailed.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by the IRS will be deleted.
