                    TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most in the fact that you
                    download our software and install it on your personal PC or you may file your return
                    on a Web based page. Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you
                    are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website. In both the download
                    and the web versions, the tax return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection.
                    Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved
                    to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted intervention. They
                    are again moved a third time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are handled
                    by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements can also be retrieved
                    via our website again without general information provided. (Example: IRS accepted
                    or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) TaxSlayer will not issue a refund for returns
                    rejected by the IRS or any state agency. Confidential information such as refund
                    amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed or e-mailed.
