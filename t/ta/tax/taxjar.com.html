		<div class="span12 intro">
			<p>Thank you for visiting the TaxJar website and reviewing our privacy policy. This privacy policy explains the types of personal information we may collect from and about you, as well as how we may disclose, use and protect that information.</p>

This policy does not apply to any of our affiliates, which may be subject to different regulations and/or may have different operating practices. Before doing business with any of our affiliates, you should consult their respective privacy policies.</p>

Collectively, this information is known as “sales tax information”.</p>
			<p>We may also collect information through the use of a software technology called “cookies”. Internet cookies allow us to customize our website for you by placing small files on your computer as you visit various components of www.TaxJar.com.
