<br>
<strong>Personal Information.</strong> TaskRabbit collects personal information only if you voluntarily choose to share such information with TaskRabbit.

<p>
<strong>TaskRabbit’s security of collected information</strong>
<br>
Your TaskRabbit account is password-protected so that only you and authorized TaskRabbit staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. If someone who represents to you they are TaskRabbit staff and asks for any personal account information, including password, check their URL. If it doesn't say they are help@TaskRabbit, they aren’t. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your TaskRabbit account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.
</p>
<p>TaskRabbit makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system by backing up data in separate back up drives and uses public key access encryption and firewalls on both our main and backup servers.  We also employ and customer record managers to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Extremely sensitive information, like credit card numbers, is always transmitted in encrypted form. Only certain authorized TaskRabbit staff can access Personal Information, and then only if it is relevant to their job duties. TaskRabbit has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing security and making sure that every TaskRabbit employee is aware of our security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, TaskRabbit cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. While TaskRabbit will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal and/or financial information stored therein, and you agree to hold TaskRabbit harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. If you have any further questions on this issue, please refer to the Terms of Use, available at <a href="http://www.taskrabbit.com/terms" target="_blank">http://www.taskrabbit.com/terms</a>. TaskRabbit expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to this website.</p>
<p>
<strong>With whom does TaskRabbit share information?</strong>
<br>
When you submit information to TaskRabbit, it is collected, processed and maintained solely by us or by third party agents who are bound by privacy restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this policy. We may allow our business partners to collect information about Users that is not extremely sensitive Information. If you would like to opt out from the onward transfer of your information to our non-agent partners, you may send us an email at <a href="mailto:opt-out-partners@taskrabbit.com">opt-out-partners@taskrabbit.com</a>. Include the word "privacy" in the subject line of the email and all your registration information in the body of the email.
</p>
<p>Some TaskRabbit content is "sponsored by" or "presented by" other companies. TaskRabbit shares market research data (how the sponsorship performed, names of contest winners, etc.) collected on this website or via email surveys with these partners. This information is aggregate and not linked to specific users.</p>
<p>Partners may sponsor promotions, contests and sweepstakes that require you to reveal details such as your name, address or phone number. Always check their privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don't want these sponsors to have your personal information, you can choose to not participate.</p>
<p>TaskRabbit reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of this website at our discretion, if required by law or if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interference with the rights of Users, the general public, or TaskRabbit, to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.</p>
<p>We will not transfer to a non-Agent third party any Personal Information that is sensitive in nature, such as information specifying your medical or health condition, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership without your prior affirmative consent.</p>
<p>Finally, TaskRabbit reserves the right to transfer, sell and/or distribute all information collected through the Service to an affiliate, subsidiary, or third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets or stock. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the new entity follows this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information, as and to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
<p>
<strong>How can Users edit their information?</strong>
<br>
TaskRabbit believes strongly in giving you the ability to access and edit your personal information. To update your personal info, click My Account at the top of any page. There you can view, update and correct your account information. You may edit your account information at any time -- all you need is your username and password.
</p>
<p>So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 18 are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@taskrabbit.com">help@taskrabbit.com</a> to find out how to change information you cannot access through your account.</p>
<p>Our databases automatically update any Personal Information you edit in your profile, or that you request we edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remains in our databases and becomes the property of TaskRabbit upon submission.</p>
<p>
<strong>Notification of changes</strong>
<br>
TaskRabbit's security and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This policy might change as TaskRabbit updates and expands the Service. TaskRabbit will endeavor to notify you of these changes by email, but will not be liable for any failure to do so. TaskRabbit also encourages you to review this privacy policy periodically.
