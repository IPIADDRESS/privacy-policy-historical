The types of service providers to whom we entrust personal information include service providers for: (i) the provision of the Services; (ii) the provision of information, products, and other services you have requested; (iii) marketing and advertising; (iv) payment processing; (v) customer service activities; and (vi) the provision IT and related services.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>APIs and Software Development Kits.</strong>&nbsp;We may use third party APIs and software development kits (“<strong></strong><em>SDKs</em>”) as part of the functionality of our Services.
