These Terms of Use are a legally binding contract between you and Taskworld regarding your use of the Service.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY USING THE SITE OR THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE TASKWORLD PRIVACY POLICY (COLLECTIVELY, THESE “<b>TERMS</b>“). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to these Terms, then please do not use the Service.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use provide that all disputes between you and Taskworld will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review the Arbitration Agreement below for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Taskworld.</p>
<ol>

By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us: (i) that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age; (ii) that you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (iii) that your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such an organization to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of such an organization.</li>
<li><b>Accounts and Registration</b>. To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself (such as your name, e-mail address or other contact information). You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.

<li><b>Enterprise Accounts</b>. Enterprise accounts on the Service may include administrator functionality that permits the enterprise administrator(s) to create and view accounts for enterprise users.</li>
<li><b>Payment</b>. Access to the Service, or to certain features of the Service, may require you to pay fees. Before you are required to pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the applicable fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Taskworld may change the fees for the Service or any feature of the Service, including by adding additional fees or charges, on a going-forward basis at any time. Taskworld will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. You authorize Taskworld to charge all sums described in this Agreement to that payment method. The Service may include functionality for activating, updating or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If you activate or update recurring payments through the Service, you authorize Taskworld to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for such accrued sums. If you use the Service to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take up to 3 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect. If you pay any applicable fees with a credit card, Taskworld may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</li>

Certain features of the Service may permit users to post content, including messages, reviews, photos, video, images, folders, data, text, and other types of works (collectively, “<b>User Content</b>“) and to publish User Content on the Service. <i>You retain copyright and any other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you post to the Service.</i></li>
<li><b>Limited License Grant to Taskworld</b>. By posting or publishing User Content, you grant Taskworld a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, and modify your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed).</li>
<li><b>Limited License Grant to Other Users</b>. By posting and sharing User Content with another user of the Service, you hereby grant that user a non-exclusive license to access and use such User Content as permitted by these Terms and the functionality of the Service.</li>
<li><b>User Content Representations and Warranties</b>. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing User Content. By posting and publishing User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>User Content Disclaimer</b>.

You understand that when using the Service you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Taskworld with respect to User Content.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 18 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</li>
<li><b>Governing Law</b> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Taskworld agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. We operate the Service from our offices in New York, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</li>
<li><b>General</b>. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Taskworld regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 5, and 7 through 22.</li>
<li><b>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Generally</b>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Taskworld in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Taskworld agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TASKWORLD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</li>
<li><b>Exceptions</b>. Notwithstanding Section 21.1, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</li>
<li><b>Arbitrator</b>. Any arbitration between you and Taskworld will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<b>AAA Rules</b>“) of the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>“), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Taskworld.</li>
<li><b>Notice; Process</b>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“<b>Notice</b>“). Taskworld’s address for Notice is: Taskworld Inc., 12 West 37th Street – Suite 502, New York, NY 10018. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“<b>Demand</b>“). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Taskworld may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Taskworld must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Taskworld will pay you: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (b) the last written settlement amount offered by Taskworld in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (c) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.</li>
<li><b>Fees</b>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Taskworld will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York County, New York provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Taskworld for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li>
<li><b>No Class Actions</b>. YOU AND TASKWORLD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Taskworld agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
<li><b>Modifications</b>. If Taskworld makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Taskworld’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Taskworld’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Taskworld will immediately be terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</li>
<li><b>Enforceability</b>. If Section 21.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 21 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Consent to Electronic Communications</b>. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</li>

You may contact us by sending correspondence to the foregoing address or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@taskworld.com">support@taskworld.com</a>.

<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>“<b>Personal Information</b>,” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information also includes information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Service, and demographic information, such as gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.</p>
<p>Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personal information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personal information, for various purposes</p>
<p>Although information uploaded to the Service by a Taskworld enterprise customer for processing (“<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Data</span></b>“) may include information that specifically identifies an individual (e.g., a Taskworld customer could upload to the Service information about its employees or other users of the Service in order to make use of the Service, including information that specifically identifies individuals such as name and email address), that information is not Personal Information for the purposes of this Policy. Please see the “Customer Data and Security” section below for information regarding Taskworld’s handling of Customer Data.</p>
<h4>Collection of Information</h4>
<p><strong>Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information</strong>We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Service. These include the following:</p>

<li><i>User Accounts and Profiles</i>. Our Service may give you the ability to register for a Taskworld account or to create and update a user profile on the applicable Service. If we offer user account or profile functionality on the Service, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering for an account or creating or updating a user profile. This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you. We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional.</li>
<li><i>Interactive Features</i>. Our Service may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Service, post comments to forums, to upload photographs and other content (the “<b>User Materials</b>“), participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Service and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on our Service that request or permit you to provide us with Personal Information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Service), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.</li>
<li><i>Correspondence</i>. If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Service, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.</li>

Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Passive Information Collection</strong>When you visit our Service, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you access our Service, we may automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Service (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Service, the actions you take on our Service, and the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on our Service. We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.</p>

We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on our Service, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to you.</p>
<p>If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.</p>
<p>Please be aware that in the course of your use of the Service, websites or other services provided by third parties (“<b>Third-Party Services</b>“), including, for example, Google Analytics, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of the Service, Third-Party Services or other services or content.

You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 5, and 7 through 22.</li>
<li><b>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Generally</b>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Taskworld in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Taskworld agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TASKWORLD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</li>
<li><b>Exceptions</b>. Notwithstanding Section 21.1, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</li>
<li><b>Arbitrator</b>. Any arbitration between you and Taskworld will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<b>AAA Rules</b>“) of the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>“), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Taskworld.</li>
<li><b>Notice; Process</b>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“<b>Notice</b>“). Taskworld’s address for Notice is: Taskworld Inc., 12 West 37th Street – Suite 502, New York, NY 10018. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“<b>Demand</b>“). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Taskworld may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Taskworld must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Taskworld will pay you: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (b) the last written settlement amount offered by Taskworld in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (c) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.</li>
<li><b>Fees</b>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Taskworld will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York County, New York provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Taskworld for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li>
<li><b>No Class Actions</b>. YOU AND TASKWORLD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Taskworld agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
<li><b>Modifications</b>. If Taskworld makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Taskworld’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Taskworld’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Taskworld will immediately be terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</li>
<li><b>Enforceability</b>. If Section 21.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 21 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Consent to Electronic Communications</b>. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</li>
<li><b>Contact Information</b>. The services hereunder are offered Taskworld Inc., located at Taskworld Inc., 12 West 37th Street – Suite 502, New York, NY 10018. You may contact us by sending correspondence to the foregoing address or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@taskworld.com">support@taskworld.com</a>.

<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>“<b>Personal Information</b>,” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information also includes information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Service, and demographic information, such as gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.</p>
<p>Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personal information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personal information, for various purposes</p>
<p>Although information uploaded to the Service by a Taskworld enterprise customer for processing (“<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Data</span></b>“) may include information that specifically identifies an individual (e.g., a Taskworld customer could upload to the Service information about its employees or other users of the Service in order to make use of the Service, including information that specifically identifies individuals such as name and email address), that information is not Personal Information for the purposes of this Policy. Please see the “Customer Data and Security” section below for information regarding Taskworld’s handling of Customer Data.</p>
<h4>Collection of Information</h4>
<p><strong>Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information</strong>We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Service. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>E-mail Newsletters</i>. We may offer e-mail newsletters from time to time on our Service. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.</li>
<li><i>User Accounts and Profiles</i>. Our Service may give you the ability to register for a Taskworld account or to create and update a user profile on the applicable Service. If we offer user account or profile functionality on the Service, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering for an account or creating or updating a user profile. This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you. We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional.</li>
<li><i>Interactive Features</i>. Our Service may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Service, post comments to forums, to upload photographs and other content (the “<b>User Materials</b>“), participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Service and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on our Service that request or permit you to provide us with Personal Information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Service), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.</li>
<li><i>Correspondence</i>. If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Service, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.</li>
<li><i>Contests and Sweepstakes</i>. We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Service. Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Passive Information Collection</strong>When you visit our Service, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you access our Service, we may automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Service (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Service, the actions you take on our Service, and the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on our Service. We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.</p>
<p>We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”). We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on our Service, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to you.</p>
<p>If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.</p>
<p>Please be aware that in the course of your use of the Service, websites or other services provided by third parties (“<b>Third-Party Services</b>“), including, for example, Google Analytics, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of the Service, Third-Party Services or other services or content. To do this, they may use first-party cookies (which are set by the same domain your browser is receiving data from) or third-party cookies (which are set by a different domain). Taskworld also may make non-personal information available to Third-Party Services, and these Third-Party Services may collect such information, to assist such parties in understanding our users’ activities and usage patterns on the Services.</p>
<p>We do not have access to, or control over, the actions of Third-Party Services. Each provider of Third-Party Services uses information that it collects in accordance with its own privacy and security policies.</p>
<p>With respect to Google, please be aware that we may use Google Analytics. Google, in the course of providing services or placing advertisements, may place or recognize one or more unique cookies on your computer, and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on our Services and on third-party websites and other Third-Party Services. Google may use information about those activities to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements. Google may, for example, customize and serve advertisements on a Third-Party Service based on content you viewed on our Services. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>We may receive information about you, including Personal Information such as gender and previous place of work from third parties, such as to integrate your social media profile onto the Taskworld platform. We may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Connect or Open ID</strong>You can log in to our Web site using sign-in services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook, Google and LinkedIn Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>

<p><strong>Enterprise Administrators</strong>The Service permits the administrator of an enterprise account to access all information submitted by the enterprise’s end users, including information about contacts that you choose to upload to the Service and your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>We may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers (e.g., payment processing and data storage and processing facilities) that assist us in our work.

You include Personal Information in User Materials at your sole risk. We may allow you to select privacy options that limit access to some types of Personal Information in User Materials, but no security measures are impenetrable or perfect. Additionally, even after information posted on the Website is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service.

<p><strong>To Protect our Interests</strong>We also disclose Personal Information if we believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Service and other users of the Service.</p>

<h4>International Visitors</h4>
<p>Our servers and data centers are located in the United States.

By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Service, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.</p>

<p>Taskworld enterprise customers may electronically submit Customer Data to the Service. Taskworld will not review, share, distribute, or reference any Customer Data except for providing the Service to that enterprise customer and its authorized users, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, at the enterprise customer’s request in connection with customer support matters, or as may be required by law.</p>
<p>We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect Personal Information and Customer Data from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction. These measures may include regular review of our data collection and storage processes, data encryption, and security software on our networks and servers. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you, including enterprise customers, provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk.</p>
<h4>Updates to this Policy</h4>
<p>We may occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the beginning of the Policy. Your continued use of our Service after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy. If we change this Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change via email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any Personal Information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information.</p>

<div>The security of your data and information is one of our top concerns at Taskworld. That is why we go to the greatest lengths to make sure that all collected data is private and secured.</div>
<h4>Your Data is Safe</h4>
<div>Taskworld uses state-of-the-art technology to ensure that your data is stored in secure locations. Among these measures are:</div>
<ul>
<li>Access to your account by encrypted password only</li>
<li>Information is hosted on <strong>Amazon Web Servers</strong> in a facility with monitored access</li>
<li>Personal and system data regularly backed up</li>
<li>Prompt release of important system updates and repairs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Control Your Privacy</h4>
<div>We also allow you to protect your information from other site members. You can:</div>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect from any colleague at any time as long as neither of you has an active task between each other</li>
<li>Choose to make little or none of your profile information visible to all Taskworld users with advanced privacy settings to limit either only visible to yourself or to your colleagues only</li>
</ul>
<h4>Amazon Web Services Hosted Data</h4>
<div>All of your data is hosted on Amazon Web Services. Amazon’s data centers are staffed around-the-clock by security guards and access is by authorization only. Storing their information in multiple physical, geographic locations allows clients to be assured that, even in the case of catastrophe, error or natural disaster, systems and data can be fully recovered quickly.</div>
