                        <h4>Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>"<b>Personal Information</b>," as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.  Personal Information also includes information about an individual's activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Service, and demographic information, such as gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.</p>

                        <p>Personal Information does not include "aggregate" or other non-personal information.  Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.  We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personal information, for various purposes</p>

                        <p>Although information uploaded to the Service by a Taskworld enterprise customer for processing ("<b><u>Customer Data</u></b>") may include information that specifically identifies an individual (e.g., a Taskworld customer could upload to the Service information about its employees or other users of the Service in order to make use of the Service, including information that specifically identifies individuals such as name and email address), that information is not Personal Information for the purposes of this Policy. Please see the "Customer Data and Security" section below for information regarding Taskworld's handling of Customer Data.</p>

                        <p>We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Service.  These include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                <i>User Accounts and Profiles</i>.  Our Service may give you the ability to register for a Taskworld account or to create and update a user profile on the applicable Service.

This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you.  We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional.                                  
                            </li>

                                <i>Interactive Features</i>.  Our Service may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Service, post comments to forums, to upload photographs and other content (the "<b>User Materials</b>"), participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Service and with other users.  If you use any interactive functionality on our Service that request or permit you to provide us with Personal Information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Service), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.

                                <i>Contests and Sweepstakes</i>.  We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Service.  Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners.  In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us.  The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such Personal Information.

                        <p>When you visit our Service, some information is collected automatically.  For example, when you access our Service, we may automatically collect your browser's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Service (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Service, the actions you take on our Service, and the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on our Service.  We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.</p>

                        <p>We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as "Web beacons").  We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on our Service, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to you.</p>

                        <p>If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy.  Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.</p>

                        <p>Please be aware that in the course of your use of the Service, websites or other services provided by third parties ("<b>Third-Party Services</b>"), including, for example, Google Analytics, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of the Service, Third-Party Services or other services or content.  To do this, they may use first-party cookies (which are set by the same domain your browser is receiving data from) or third-party cookies (which are set by a different domain).  Taskworld also may make non-personal information available to Third-Party Services, and these Third-Party Services may collect such information, to assist such parties in understanding our users' activities and usage patterns on the Services.</p>

                        <p>We do not have access to, or control over, the actions of Third-Party Services.  Each provider of Third-Party Services uses information that it collects in accordance with its own privacy and security policies.</p>

                        <p>With respect to Google, please be aware that we may use Google Analytics.  Google, in the course of providing services or placing advertisements, may place or recognize one or more unique cookies on your computer, and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on our Services and on third-party websites and other Third-Party Services.  Google may use information about those activities to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements.  Google may, for example, customize and serve advertisements on a Third-Party Service based on content you viewed on our Services. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

                        <strong class="header">Information from Other Sources</strong>
                        <p>We may receive information about you, including Personal Information such as gender and previous place of work from third parties, such as to integrate your social media profile onto the Taskworld platform. We may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you.  If we do so, this Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.</p>

                        <strong class="header">Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Connect or Open ID</strong>
                        <p>You can log in to our Web site using sign-in services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook, Google and LinkedIn Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>

                        <h4>Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information that we collect on the Service to third parties without your consent.  We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:</p>

                        <strong class="header">Enterprise Administrators</strong>      
                        <p>The Service permits the administrator of an enterprise account to access all information submitted by the enterprise's end users, including information about contacts that you choose to upload to the Service and your Personal Information.</p>

                        <strong class="header">Service Providers</strong>
                        <p>We may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers (e.g., payment processing and data storage and processing facilities) that assist us in our work.  We limit the Personal Information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such Personal Information.</p>

                        <strong class="header">Public Areas</strong>       
                        <p>Some features on our Service may allow you to upload, post, or otherwise transmit User Materials to public areas of the Service, such as content that you post in a public profile on the Service.  Please be aware that any Personal Information that you include within any User Materials will be made available to other users of the Service.  You include Personal Information in User Materials at your sole risk.  We may allow you to select privacy options that limit access to some types of Personal Information in User Materials, but no security measures are impenetrable or perfect.  Additionally, even after information posted on the Website is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service.  We cannot warrant or guarantee that any Personal Information that you provide on and in connection with the Service will not be accessed, viewed, or used by unauthorized persons.</p>

                        <strong class="header">Business Transfers</strong>
                        <p>Information about our users, including Personal Information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of Taskworld assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal Information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.</p>

                        <strong class="header">To Protect our Interests</strong>
                        <p>We also disclose Personal Information if we believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Service and other users of the Service.</p>

You may also opt-out from receiving commercial e-mail from us, and any other promotional communications that we may send to you from time to time (e.g., by postal mail) by sending your request to us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@taskworld.com">privacy@taskworld.com</a> or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.  Additionally, if we offer user account functionality on the Service, we may allow you to view and modify settings relating to the nature and frequency of promotional communications that you receive from us.<br><br>

                        If you request that we delete your account on any of our Service (via a user settings page, by e-mail, or otherwise), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your Personal Information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. </p>

Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent.  If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 on our Service, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

                        <h4>International Visitors</h4>
                        <p>Our servers and data centers are located in the United States. If you choose to use the Service from outside the U.S., then you should know that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into the U.S. for storage and processing. By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Service, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S.  Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service.  You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.</p>

                        <h4>Customer Data and Security</h4>
                        <p>Taskworld enterprise customers may electronically submit Customer Data to the Service. Taskworld will not review, share, distribute, or reference any Customer Data except for providing the Service to that enterprise customer and its authorized users, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, at the enterprise customer's request in connection with customer support matters, or as may be required by law. <br><br>
                            
                        We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect Personal Information and Customer Data from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction. These measures may include regular review of our data collection and storage processes, data encryption, and security software on our networks and servers. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you, including enterprise customers, provide to us.  You transmit information to us at your own risk. </p>

                        <p>We may occasionally update this Policy.  When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the beginning of the Policy.  Your continued use of our Service after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy.  If we change this Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change via email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any Personal Information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective.  We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information.</p>
