It is Taskstream-Tk20’s policy not to share your personal information with any third parties, other than in the limited circumstances set out below.</p>
<p>Taskstream-Tk20 enables you to comply with your privacy and confidentiality obligations.

Any information you disclose in these areas will be available to certain other end users, and may be collected and used by persons other than Taskstream-Tk20. You should not disclose any information that you do not want others to know on these areas of the Site. Taskstream-Tk20 does not routinely monitor these areas, and you use forums and tools at your own risk. In addition, you may also provide us with information such as your name, subject and grade / university level that you are in or that you teach, contact email address (if supplied), lesson plans, assignments, work product, and assessment rubrics, that identifies your own content. This information will be available only to other individuals with Taskstream-Tk20 IDs and passwords within your organization with permission to view it, UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO PUBLISH IT ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB.

<p>Taskstream-Tk20 provides various communication tools that enable users to share work with users and non-users of Taskstream-Tk20. Once you have shared work with a third party, Taskstream-Tk20 no longer can control access to that work and can make no assurances as to the privacy of that work. Do not disclose or send information to third parties that you do not want others to know, use or publish in other forums.</p>
<p>Taskstream-Tk20 may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, a subpoena or other legal process. We may also disclose such information as is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a person or entity who may be violating Taskstream-Tk20’s Terms of Use (or such other agreements to which an end user is a party), or who may be causing injury to, or interfering with, other users of the Site and Services, or other third parties who may be harmed by such activities.
