        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">The Information TasteDive Collects</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            Information You Provide: If you create a TasteDive account, you may provide what is generally called
            "personally identifiable" information, such as your name, email address or country of residence.
            You may also provide TasteDive with your preferences in terms of music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, books, authors, games
            that you like or dislike, and other user profiles that you like.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            "Automatically Collected" Information: When you access TasteDive or open one of our emails,
            we may automatically record certain information from your system, such as the Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"),
            a unique user ID, as saved on your TasteDive profile, and the dates and times that you visit TasteDive.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            Facebook Information: if you connect with TasteDive using your Facebook account,
            TasteDive may retrieve additional taste-related information, such as the bands or movies that you liked on Facebook.
            This is solely for the purpose of prefilling your TasteDive profile likes, enhancing the quality of the recommendations
            and providing a more personalized experience (providing you with better recommendations).
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            "Cookies" Information: When you access TasteDive, we may send one or more cookies -
            small text files containing a string of characters - to your computer.
            We use cookies to personalize content, to provide social features and to analyse our traffic.
            We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.
            TasteDive may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Cookies can be deleted by users from their browser.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            Your username: Your username is displayed throughout TasteDive and is therefore available to the public. Other people can see your likes, dislikes, associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your username, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on TasteDive.

            and provide all of the features and services found on the TasteDive website.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            We may use your email address for service emails relating to your registration,
            for instance notifications when another user likes your profile,
            administrative communications such as notifying you of major TasteDive updates,
            for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices.
            You can control which emails to receive from your account settings
            (after logging in, go to: <a href="https://tastedive.com/account/settings">https://tastedive.com/account/settings</a> ).
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteDive uses some of the information that we collect to improve the way the TasteDive website works and looks,
            and to create new features and functionality. Taste-related information, such as the bands, musicians,
            authors, movies, games, books and TV shows titles that you like or dislike, may be used
            to improve the quality of the recommendations.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">When TasteDive Discloses Information</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteDive does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for
            their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.
            Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display
            on any publicly available portion of TasteDive - such as when you publish contact information,
            your likes and dislikes on your profile - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others
            without restriction.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteDive may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief
            that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order,
            judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">User Control of Personal Data</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            Users can at any time download their personal data or delete their accounts from the account settings page:

        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteDive uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to TasteDive, and you do so at your own risk.

        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TASTEDIVE PLATFORM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, TasteDive does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age.
