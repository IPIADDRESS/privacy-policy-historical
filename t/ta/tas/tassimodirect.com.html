											<a name="types"></a><b>Types Of Information We Collect</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											<a name="info"></a><b><i>Personally Identifiable Information</i></b>
											<br>
											<br>
											On our website, we collect certain personally identifiable information about 
											our online visitors. Personally identifiable information relates to an 
											individual consumer - for example, name, address, telephone number and e-mail 
											address. You may provide personally identifiable information, for example, by 
											registering on our site or by entering a promotion. We don't require you to 
											register or provide personally identifiable information to view our site or 
											access much of its content. But if you register, you may use certain additional 
											features like "Tassimo Updates." Here are the ways we collect 
											personally identifiable information.
											<br>
											<blockquote> <a name="registration"></a>Registration<br>
												<br>
												To take full advantage of all our offerings, you may choose to register on our 
												site. In the registration process, we request certain information (such as your 
												contact information and age range) so we can provide you with the 
												communications you request, tailor our website to better meet your needs and 
												customize our contacts with you. We also may use the registration information 
												you provide for other purposes to which you consent.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="contests"></a>Contests, Sweepstakes and Games
												<br>
												<br>
												Our site may contain notices of contests, sweepstakes and games we are 
												conducting, which you may enter electronically in some cases. We will use the 
												information you provide to conduct the promotion (for example, to contact you 
												if you're a winner). We won't use the information you provide to enter the 
												promotion for any other purpose unless you've agreed otherwise.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="updates"></a>Tassimo Updates
												<br>
												<br>
												When you ask us to send you information about our products and promotions by 
												e-mail, you may provide us with certain information like your e-mail address so 
												we can fulfill your request.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="contact"></a>"Contact Us" Link
												<br>
												<br>
												If you e-mail us through the "Contact Us" link on this site, we ask you for 
												information such as your first name and e-mail address so we can respond to 
												your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information 
												as well.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="shop"></a>Shop Tassimo
												<br>
												<br>
												When you ask us to send you certain Tassimo products or promotional items, we 
												request your contact information (such as postal and e-mail address) and 
												payment information (such as credit card number) so we can fulfill your 
												request. We use this information only to send you the items you ordered. We may 
												use service providers to help us fulfill your order. We share information about 
												you with these service providers only for this purpose.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="tell"></a>Tell A Friend
												<br>
												<br>
												We may give you the opportunity to tell your friends about new products or 
												features on our website. If you take advantage of our Tell A Friend option, we 
												ask you for your friend's and your first name and e-mail addresses. We use your 
												friend's name and e-mail address only to send the information you request we 
												forward. We don't keep your friend's e-mail address or use it for any other 
												purpose. We don't keep your e-mail address or use it for any other purpose 
												unless you've given us permission to do so.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="other"></a>Other Site Features
												<br>
												<br>
												We offer visitors to our website various features for their enjoyment, which we 
												change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain 
												personally identifiable information so we can provide you with these features.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="questionnaires"></a>Questionnaires and Surveys
												<br>
												<br>
												We may occasionally ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and 
												opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys 
												help us understand the needs of our visitors. We do not keep any 
												personally identifiable information about you in connection with your 
												participation in a website survey unless you specifically agree to provide this 
												information. </blockquote>
											<br>
											<a name="aggregate"></a><b>Aggregate and Non-Personal Information</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit our 
											website. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, 
											identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users visited our 
											site, the pages accessed, the information downloaded and the type of web 
											browser and operating system used. By collecting this information, we learn how 
											to best tailor our website to our visitors. We collect this information either 
											through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons," as explained below.
											<br>
											<blockquote> <a name="cookies"></a>Cookies
												<br>
												<br>
												Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our website. Cookies are bits of text 
												that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. 
												Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you 
												are visiting a particular site.
												<br>
												<br>
												When you visit our website, cookies are placed on your computer. We use cookies 
												to tell us, for example, whether you've visited us before or if you're a new 
												visitor and to help us identify site features and recipes in which you may have 
												the greatest interest. We collect this information to enhance your experience 
												on our website.
												<br>
												<br>
												The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop 
												accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and 
												how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, without cookies, you may not 
												be able to take full advantage of all of our website features.
												<br>
												<br>
												<a name="beacons"></a>Web Beacons
												<br>
												<br>
												Certain pages on our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, 
												pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain 
												information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on 
												which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the 
												time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to 
												view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. </blockquote>
											<br>
											<a name="how_use"></a><b>How We Use Personally Identifiable Information</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											We may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time. For 
											example, we may (i) send you promotional materials and other communications you 
											request, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if 
											needed while processing a product or service you requested through our website. 
											We also may use the information you provide to contact you for your opinions on 
											our products or the website.
											<br>
											<br>
											We also use personally identifiable information about you to improve our 
											website features and content and to analyze website usage. In addition, we use 
											personally identifiable information for market research purposes. We also may 
											use Personally identifiable information about you to deliver content that is 
											customized to your interests as we understand them from the information you've 
											provided to us and your activities on the site. This customized content may 
											include product information and promotions.
											<br>
											<br>
											<a name="how_share"></a><b>How We Share Personally Identifiable Information</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											Except as described below, we don't sell, transfer or otherwise disclose to 
											third parties the Personally identifiable information we collect on this 
											website without your prior consent. We disclose information where we think it's 
											necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to 
											ourselves or others or where disclosure is required by law. We also may 
											disclose information in response to a request from law enforcement authorities 
											or other government officials. We also disclose information to third parties we 
											retain to perform services on our behalf. For example, we hire service 
											providers to help us run promotions, fulfill orders you may place and provide 
											customer service. These service providers may have access to 
											Personally identifiable information about our website visitors if it is needed 
											to perform their functions for Tassimo, but they are not authorized by Tassimo 
											to use the information for their own marketing purposes.
											<br>
											<br>
											On our website, we may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may 
											share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain 
											Personally identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We 
											will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other 
											purpose unless you tell us it's ok to do so.
											<br>
											<br>
											We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event 
											we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a 
											sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that 
											the transferee use personal information provided through this website in a 
											manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.
											<br>
											<br>
											<a name="links"></a><b>Links To Other Websites</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											This website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely 
											for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy 
											practices. You should always check the privacy notice of the specific site 
											you're visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site.
											<br>
											<br>
											<a name="choices"></a><b>Your Choices</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											You can change your preferences for follow-up contacts just by e-mailing us or 
											by changing the information you've provided to us in the "Your Profile" section 
											of the site. If you prefer, you can cancel your registration altogether. E-mail 
											us if you wish to take this action.
											<br>
											<br>
											<a name="how_protect"></a><b>How We Protect Personally Identifiable Information</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											The security of Personally identifiable information is important to us. We 
											maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against 
											unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the 
											Personally identifiable information we collect on this website.
											<br>
											<br>
											<a name="updates"></a><b>Updates To This Privacy Notice</b>
											<br>
											<br>
											We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time. Please 
											check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the
