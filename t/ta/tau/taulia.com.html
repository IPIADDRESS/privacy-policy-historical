<h2 id="info">Information Collected by Taulia</h2>
<p>We collect information from you when you contact us for more information regarding our services or register on our site for our support forums, subscribe to our newsletter or webinar series, participate in an online forum, blog, or voluntary survey, download content or fill out a form. We may collect all or some of the following information: name, email address, phone number, company name, title, department, country and/or industry. Alternatively, you may visit our site anonymously. Any data we request that is not required will be specified as voluntary or optional.</p>
<p>We may also collect information when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>Personal Information refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.</p>
<p>If your Personal Information changes, to request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/deactivate it by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:privacy@taulia.com">privacy@taulia.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h3>Surveys</h3>
<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information such as name, email, and phone number, and demographic information such as job title, income, location, and company size.</p>
<p>We use this information to send notice(s) to contest winners, award prizes, monitor site traffic, personalize the site, send participants email newsletter(s), and better understand our customers and prospects.</p>
<p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

<h2 id="use">Use of Personal Information by Taulia</h2>
<p>Any of the information we collect may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>To administer your account and facilitate your transactions</li>
<li>To respond to customer service requests</li>
<li>To send periodic emails when you have requested to receive them. (The email address you provide for order processing, may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order or request, in addition to receiving occasional company news, updates, promotions, related product or service information, etc.)</li>
<li>To provide you the Taulia services you have requested</li>
<li>To improve our websites. (We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.)</li>
<li>To personalize your experience. (Your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choice/Opt-Out</h3>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your information used for certain purposes or to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, when we ask for the information. If you no longer wish to receive emails, our newsletter and other promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@taulia.com">privacy@taulia.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="protect">How Taulia Protects Your Information</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us.</p>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information when you submit a request, or otherwise provide us with your personal information. These security measures include: password protected directories and databases to safeguard your information and PCI Scanning to actively protect our servers from hackers and other vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Taulia. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@taulia.com">privacy@taulia.com</a> with questions regarding our security measures.</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications at all times.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>
<p>We use cookies that allow us to recognize your browser and capture and store certain information to provide you with secure access to the data and documents you are entitled to view. We have control over these cookies and they underlie our Privacy Policy. In order to be effective, we link the information we store in cookies to your user ID (email address).</p>
<p>Our service providers only use cookies that are not tied to Personal Information. The use of cookies by our service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
<h3>Clear Gifs</h3>
<p>We use clear gifs to better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer's Personal Information.</p>
<p>Our integrated third party service providers use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we use third party tracking-utility partners to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. </p>
<p>We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<h3>Social Media Features and Widgets</h3>
<p>Our Web Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<h2 id="share">Third Parties With Whom Taulia Shares Personal Information</h2>
<p>Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy regarding notice and choice and are subject to the service agreements with our service providers and clients. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties the Personal Information you provide. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our websites, conducting our business, maintaining our blog, or servicing you. If you have questions regarding our products or services, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process), enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
<p>If Taulia is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</p>

<h2 id="links">Third Party Links</h2>
<p>Other sites accessible through our Web Site have their own privacy policies and data collection use and disclosure practices. Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Web Site as well as provide links to sites that are owned and operated by these third party providers. Please consult each site's privacy policy, as the information practices of these third party sites are not covered by our Privacy Policy. We cannot control their collection of information, and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.</p>
<p>While we continue to seek to protect the integrity of our own site, you should contact these sites directly if you have any questions about the use of the information that they collect.</p>

<h2 id="california">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>
<p>Because we value your privacy, we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your Personal Information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

<h2 id="children">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") took effect on April 21, 2000, and imposes certain requirements on web sites directed toward children under the age of 13 that collection information on those children, or on web sites that know they are collecting personally identifiable information on children under the age of 13. We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA and we do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under the age of 13. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older. If we find that we have collected information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information immediately.</p>

<h2 id="canspam">CAN-SPAM Compliance</h2>
<p>We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that we are compliant with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.</p>

<h2 id="terms">Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>Please also visit our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> section establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of our website at <a href="/terms-of-use">www.taulia.com/terms-of-use</a>.</p>

<h2 id="consent">Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using our site, you consent to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes to Taulia's Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, and/or update the Privacy Policy modification date at the top of this page. Policy changes will apply only to information collected after the date of the change. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a prominent notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices before proceeding to use our Web Site.</p>
<p>The English version of this policy shall govern in the event of any conflict or substantive translation changes into a non-English language.</p>
