<more-today class="tarot-widget" scope="[&quot;Love relationships get a boost from the cosmos as four planets playfully congregate in consequential Capricorn today. However, once the moody Moon bumps up against powerful Pluto, we may be inclined to be pushy about our stubborn agendas or double-down on our emotional or physical needs. Being more gentle and spontaneous within our love connections can be the elixir to fix what troubles our hearts while romantic Venus creates an uncomfortable connection with quixotic Neptune now. &quot;,&quot;As you prepare for the next minute, hour, day of living authentically and embracing your passionate purpose, you will get yet another cosmic clue that can help point you in the right direction today. Step-by-step you venture forward, leading with your heart, knowing that any potholes along your path can be artfully avoided if you don't rush romance. Creative visualization works like a treasure map, clarifying your direction and reaffirming your commitment to your own passionate joy. &quot;,&quot;There is needless effort being made in the wrong direction today, making your love life circumstances feel sluggish or even like you've hit the pause button at this moment. This may be down to the fact that you're momentarily stuck in a deep groove, perhaps a romantic routine that doesn't suit your current mood for adventure. You want more effervescence and excitement right now but to get to there you'll have to shed some emotional heaviness and strive for spontaneity, positivity and a dose of daring.&quot;,&quot;You can see the arc of your romantic plot becoming more challenging to manage, but the cosmos offers you an emotional reboot that can clear any stuck energy today. At this moment, your job is to own your shadows and summon the courage to face them with brutal honesty. The mirror that is your heart will tell you what you must change if you admit the truth to yourself. Your attitude can have more gratitude, and this summons more love and acceptance in your love relationship now.&quot;,&quot;There's a recurring hiccup in your love life and its roots date way back to some formative experience in your youth. You are ready to shed outmoded attitudes, habits and romantic routines that seem like dinosaurs in your avant-garde heart and soul. If you're getting to know someone better and believe there is potential for sexy adventure, be extra judicious about how you move your love connection forward. Your passionate dreams are jewels that should be cherished and cared for like nothing else and shedding your yesterdays can help you achieve that now.&quot;,&quot;An unexpected exchange with someone you find attractive begins as small talk but could end up being an epic revelation that inspires your heart and soul right now. A part of you will become aware of unfinished business that you want closure on before you can fully participate in current passionate endeavors. Being responsible about tying up loose ends is your only romantic assignment today, because it allows you to finally move forward toward a passionate future.&quot;,&quot;An energetic adjustment is required to move past the emotional noise surrounding your current love life circumstances. You're super sensitive at this moment, but getting through such a day will be easier when you know the cosmos has something very different in store for you tomorrow. If a current romantic relationship is unbalanced, you have an opportunity to bring harmony back into the fold today. Check your assumptions and check in with the one you love to make sure you're both on the same page.  &quot;,&quot;Trying to balance out your need to be on your own with your desire to be with a lover can bring tense moments into your day. Additionally, if you're in a long-term partnership, money matters may be weighing on you at this moment. Don't fret, don't give up or otherwise blow a fuse because your issues aren't half as bad as you think they are. In fact, your romantic relationship is going to get a cosmic bonus of one sort or another very soon. It may be a financial windfall or just an energetic boost. Either way, today's relationship stress will soon dissipate.&quot;,&quot;Every relationship has its roller-coaster moments and you may be reeling from one right this minute. Whether there's ongoing tension in your love relationship or you haven't yet processed what your heart is feeling following a cathartic conversation with your partner, today is a day to avoid drama, be honest about your fears and give your lover your ear instead of your words. Integrity and compassion create a foundation of trust in your love connection, especially when it's been hard-going for a while. Keep the faith!&quot;,&quot;Fear of emotional upheaval or scarcity may cause you to hang on too tight to current romantic circumstances. However, being flexible is the only way to face such a challenge right now. Accept the flow of romantic energy and don't focus on what you don't have, but instead focus on what you have to be grateful for at this time. Regaining trust with the one you love can be a game-changer in your relationship at this moment, especially if it's been missing lately.&quot;,&quot;As you become better at representing your heart's truth with each passing moment, you can be more spontaneously sexy in matters of love today. You want to be the avid antenna in your romantic relationship right now, picking up signals from your sweetheart that are more than words and glances, more than passionate vibes -- you're intuitively feeling energy and it's giving you information outside of the usual conduits right now. This is a perfect day to tune into the subtleties that you usually cannot see. &quot;,&quot;If you're harboring long-held fears that stem from your love life's past, consider spending time with them today in an effort to learn something from them and then let them go. It may be a bad memory or a funky flashback that leads to heartache, but digging through these roots can open up an incredible opportunity to accept, heal and move on. Whatever was buried wants to come up for air, including some experiences that you haven't processed yet. &quot;,&quot;Taking a romantic risk can turn what feels like routine into a new, ardent adventure today. Something sexy and special can become humdrum if you overdo it, but you and the one you love are ready for something exciting that needs to be discovered. Letting go of the edge of the pool allows you to dive in deep right now. This is the change you seek in matters of the heart, and it requires a courageous commitment to your passionate journey. Out with the old -- in with the bold! &quot;]" psychic="    <strong>SHARP WORDS</strong><br/>This is a &quot;torch-tongue&quot;&quot; day. Mild critiques suddenly be…
