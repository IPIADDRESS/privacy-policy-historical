 <h3>Privacy Regarding Clients of AudienceScience's Services</h3>
 <p>This information is intended to inform you, the end user, about  how AudienceScience handles information we process on behalf of our Web site  owners, advertisers, and service providers who use our services (our  "Clients") as part of our data analytics services and information we  process for our network advertising services. This information also explains  our own practices for our corporate Web site.<a href="http://www.truste.com/trusted_sites/index.html#A" target="_blank"><img src="/images/truste.gif" alt="TRUSTe" border="0" class="inside_image_big"></a></p>
 <p> AudienceScience is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users'  trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information  practices. <strong>This privacy statement covers the Web site  www.audiencescience.com.</strong> Because we want to demonstrate our commitment  to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have  our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
 <p> If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement,  you should first contact our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@audiencescience.com" class="blue_links">privacy@audiencescience.com</a>.</p>
 If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry  or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact  TRUSTe at <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint" target="_blank" class="blue_links">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint</a>. <a href="http://www.truste.com/trusted_sites/index.html#A" target="_blank"><img src="/images/truste_seal.gif" alt="TRUSTe EU SAFE HARBOR" border="0" class="inside_image_big"></a>TRUSTe  will then serve as liaison with us to resolve your concerns. AudienceScience  complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of  Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European  Union.
 <p>AudienceScience reserves the right to change how we handle  information we process on behalf of our Clients as well as our own practices in  regard to AudienceScience's services or corporate Web site.</p>
 <h3>What Does AudienceScience Do?</h3>
 <p>We provide data analysis and audience segmentation services  based on information provided by our Clients regarding their customer  interactions, including those on the Client's Web site or online  advertisements. We create usage/behavior/interest-based categories called  "segments". Segments are unique groups of users that are created  using Client-defined criteria that enable the Client to selectively serve  targeted advertisements and otherwise profile users of that Client's site(s) or  advertisements. We are an outsource solution for what many companies traditionally  have done internally, including traffic pattern and behavioral trend  evaluations to enhance the usefulness and marketing power of their sites and  services. Companies outsource these services to us to reduce cost, increase  efficiencies, and decrease turnaround time.</p>
 <p>We also provide targeting advertising services using  non-personal information that is gathered across multiple, unaffiliated Web  sites that use our network. Much like our data analytic services provided for  specific Web sites, we create network segments that are used to serve targeted  advertisements and profile users in our network. </p>
 <h3>What Information Do We Collect for Our Clients, How Do We Use It for Our Data Analytics Services and How Long Do We Retain the Information?</h3>
 <p>Our Clients collect information about their customer interactions  using cookies, action tags, and other methods. Cookies are small text files  that identify your computer. Web site owners use cookies to, among other  things, monitor site usage, customize site features, identify a user's computer  operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag (also  known as a "clear gif" or "Web beacon") is a small, graphic  image on a Web page that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party  to monitor who is visiting a site by collecting the IP address of the computer  that the tag is sent to, the URL of the page the tag comes from, and the time  it was viewed. Tags also may be associated with cookie information.</p>
 <p>   A Client may provide information that it collects, including  personally identifiable information, to AudienceScience. We also may collect  data on behalf of a Client using tags. Information that we collect and compile  directly from users includes "clickstream" data such as behavioral  data, IP addresses, log files, and other traffic data. We do not collect any  personally identifiable information directly from any user, whether using  cookies or action tags. As part of our analytics and segmentation services, we  may place a cookie on your browser when you visit the Client's Web site or view  an advertisement of the Client.</p>
 <p>   We use data provided by the Client, as well as data that we  collect on behalf of the Client, only to create segments and reports for the  Client. Additionally, we make information that we collect for or receive from a  particular Client available only to that Client. Non-personal information collected by AudienceScience for this purpose is retained for no more than two (2) years.</p>
 <p>   We may provide our analytic or segmentation services to Clients  that are network advertisers or service providers. These Clients may use a  process whereby data is collected over time and across the Internet to  determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically  for use in ad delivery (called "Online Preference Marketing"  ["OPM"]). On behalf of and at the direction of an OPM Client, we may  collect non-personal information that the Client may use for OPM purposes on  behalf of its customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. OPM Clients  are responsible for notifying you of these collection practices and making  opt-out procedures available (if any).</p>
 <p>   A Client may correlate or merge information that we report to it  with personal information already collected or accessible by that Client. On  behalf of a Client, we may correlate or merge personal information provided by  the Client with non-personal information that we collect for that Client. Our  Clients are responsible for notifying you whether they correlate or merge  personal information to non-personal information that they collect or that we  or any other third party collects on their behalf.</p>
 <p>   AudienceScience firmly supports and encourages our Clients to adopt  privacy policies that fully inform the Client's customers or users about the  Client's information collection practices and use of AudienceScience's  services. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of any Web  site you visit to understand what information the site collects, how the  information is used, what choices you have, how to access the information, and  how it is safeguarded.</p>
 <h3>Do We Disclose or Permit Access to Our Client's Information?</h3>
 <p>We keep all data that we receive from and store for our Clients  strictly confidential. We are contractually obligated to maintain such  confidentiality and we hold our vendors and subcontractors to the same  standards whenever they provide services related to the Client's information.  We do not permit access to the information except as directed by our Client.</p>
 <h3>What Information Do We Collect; and How Do We Use It for Our Network Advertising Services; and How Long Do We Retain the Information?</h3>
 <p>Separate from our data analytics services, we provide Online Preference Marketing (OPM) or network advertising services. For these services, we use a process whereby data is anonymously collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in ad delivery. Our Web tags, beacons, or cookies may collect non-personal information that may be used for OPM purposes on behalf of our customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. Our systems are designed not to collect, process, or store personal information. Non-personal information collected by AudienceScience for this purpose is retained for no more than two (2) years. As part of these OPM and network advertising services, we also collect ad delivery and reporting data. This limited type of anonymous, advertising performance data is kept indefinitely.</p>
 <p>   As part of AudienceScience's commitment to respect privacy  concerns and implement industry-recognized standards, AudienceScience is a  member of the NAI and the IAB UK Good Practice Principles. AudienceScience  complies with the NAI and the IAB UKSelf-Regulatory  Principles which are designed to inform consumers about data collection and  advertising practices across multiple Web sites and provide the ability to opt  out. For more information about OPM and network advertising, please visit the  NAI Web site at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" class="blue_links">www.networkadvertising.org</a> in the US and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.co.uk/" class="blue_links">www.youronlinechoices.co.uk</a> in the UK.</p>
 <h3>Do We Disclose or Permit Sharing of Information That We Collect for Our  Network Services?</h3>
 <p>The non-personal user information that we collect to create  segments and profile information for our network service is only shared with a  third party that is authorized and requested by the websites where the data is  collected or originated. An OPM Client may share these segments in accordance with  the terms and conditions of the Client's respective privacy policy and subject  to such other contractual restrictions imposed by AudienceScience. To provide  our network advertising services, we do enable our customers to customize the  segments and other user characteristics that they will use to serve and deliver  advertisements. Our network advertising customers are contractually prohibited  from using any network segment information to correlate it to or merge it with  information that they may collect, process, or store in connection with their  site, including personal information except in compliance with the applicable  Self-Regulatory NAI Principles, and such customer's privacy policy.</p>
 <h3>Do I Have the Ability Not to Be Identified for AudienceScience's Network  Advertising Services?</h3>
 <p>Yes. If you do not want your browser to be identified and used  for network advertising (OPM) purposes, you may visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" class="blue_links">www.networkadvertising.org</a> in the US and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.co.uk/" class="blue_links">www.youronlinechoices.co.uk</a> in the UK for information on how to obtain an  "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being associated with your  browser. Please note that if you elect to opt out, the cookie associated with  your browser will be associated with a "blank" or "generic"  cookie. Therefore, advertisements that may be served to you on Web sites using  our services may repeat and may not be targeted to your interests. <a href="http://audiencescience.com/docs/nai.pdf" target="_blank" class="blue_links">Click here for  instructions on how to opt out </a>of AudienceScience's network advertising  services. </p>
 <h3>Do We Have a "P3P" Policy?</h3>
 <p>Yes, AudienceScience also subscribes to a P3P policy, which may  be viewed in plain text by accessing the "Privacy Report" in your  browser. To the extent that there is any inconsistency between the  machine-readable P3P policy and this privacy statement, this privacy statement  governs.</p>
 <h3>How Do We Store Information?</h3>
 <p>All information that is provided by our Clients is stored in a  database unique to each Client. Unless expressly permitted by a Client and  adequately disclosed in the Client’s privacy policy, we do not commingle or  share data between or among our Clients. AudienceScience takes reasonable steps  to assure that all Client information sent to us from our Clients is secured  from unauthorized interception and to protect it from loss, misuse, and  unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in storage while  under our control. While we have taken efforts to guard information, we cannot  guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances  or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>
 <h3>Do We Have a Mechanism to Address Complaints about the Handling of  Information That We Collect?</h3>
 <p>AudienceScience participates in the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by  the United States Department of Commerce. To address any issues regarding our  compliance with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles, AudienceScience, along with  the NAI and other NAI members have created a compliance program that  incorporates attestation reviews, a consumer complaint process, sanctions and  annual reporting to help ensure that member companies keep their promises to  you and abide by the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/networks/2008%20NAI%20Principles_final%20for%20Website.pdf" target="_blank" class="blue_links">NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct</a>. Please refer to the  NAI site for more information at the NAI website. </p>
 <p>   To address any issues around AudienceScience’s compliance with the IAB UK  Good Practice Principles, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.co.uk/" class="blue_links">www.youronlinechoices.co.uk</a>.</p>
 <p>   If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise  your complaint with TRUSTe by Internet at <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint" target="_blank" class="blue_links">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint</a>,  or by mail at WatchDog Complaints, TRUSTe, 685 Market Street, Suite 560, San    Francisco, CA, USA 94105. If you are mailing  TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the  name of the company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information,  and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the  company.

The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English.</p>
 <p>   If you have questions regarding our compliance with the NAI  Self-Regulatory Principles, NAI and its members have engaged TRUSTe to create  and manage an independent program for purpose of ensuring that NAI members like  AudienceScience comply with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles.
