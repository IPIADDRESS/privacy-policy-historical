<p>Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi maintains this web 
  site as an information resource and service for the public. 
  In the course of providing you this information, we are able 
  to gather and archive several types of data about visitors to 
  our web site. In respect to your privacy and in accordance with 
  State law, the following outlines how we handle those types 
  of data.</p>
<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b> Personal information

  question or meet your needs.</p>
<p>The University accumulates data and keeps records to enable staff and faculty 
  to plan educational opportunities to meet the needs of individual students, 
  to better understand students, to counsel more effectively with them and to

  Provisions are made for students to review and challenge the accuracy of records 
  when appropriate and upon request. The University also complies with the Family 
  Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and with the Texas Public Information 
  Act.</p>
<p>Some directory information (e.g., home address, local address, local telephone 
  number, etc.) given to the University is considered public information and will 
  be released by the University upon request, in accordance with existing law.
