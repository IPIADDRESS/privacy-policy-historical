(“Tock,” “we,” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy describes the types of information, including personal information, that Tock may collect from you or users of your Tock account (collectively, “you” or “your”) or that you may provide when you visit<!-- --> <a class="Anchor" href="/">www.exploretock.com</a>, any predecessor or successor websites established by Tock which reference this Privacy Policy, and any Tock applications (collectively, the “Site”) or access or use the Tock reservation service offered through the Site (the “Service”). It also describes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.</span></p><p><span class="B2">This Privacy Policy applies both to persons who register or establish an account with Tock and to casual browsers of the Site. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect on the Site and in email, text and other electronic messages between you and Tock. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by Tock offline or by any third party, including through any application or content that may link to or be accessible from the Site.</span></p><p><span class="B2">This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made a part of Tock’s<!-- --> <a class="Anchor" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">Consent</span></h4><p><span class="B2">By accessing or using the Site, you signify your consent to this Privacy Policy, including without limitation our use of cookies, tracking pixels and IP address logging, as discussed below. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, your choice is not to access or use the Site.</span></p><p><span class="B2">We may modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole discretion. We indicate at the top of the page when this Privacy Policy was last modified or updated. Your continued access or use of the Site following any modification or update constitutes and signifies your full acceptance of the changes.</span></p><p><span class="B2">If we make material changes to how we treat your information, we will notify you through a notice on the Site homepage and/or an email. You are responsible for periodically visiting the Site and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">Third Party Web Sites</span></h4><p><span class="B2">If you click on a link to a third-party web site on the Site, including without limitation, any restaurant, bar, winery, or other customer of Tock (“Business”) web site, third-party payment processor web site or social network web site, you will leave the Site and go to the web site you selected. If you choose to share your information with any third-party website through buttons provided on the Site (e.g., you may share your reservation information on Facebook and Twitter), you will post such information to such third-party website outside of the Site. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, including without limitation, Businesses, third-party payment processors and social networks, we are not responsible for any use of your information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to this Privacy Policy. If you visit or share your information with a third-party web site that is linked to the Site, you should consult that website’s privacy policy before providing any personal or other information.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">What is personal information and when does Tock collect it?</span></h4><p><span class="B2">Personal information is information by which you may be personally identified. Personal information may include your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, mobile number, home or other physical address, birth date, credit card information, any information that permits you to be contacted physically or online and other personal information as defined under applicable law. Tock collects such personal information directly from you when you (i) use the Site or Service (including, but not limited to, when you register an account with Tock and enter information into your profile); (ii) make a reservation through the Site or Service; (iii) communicate via chats, conferences, and other avenues of communication on the Site; (iv) request further services from Tock or third parties on the Site; (v) participate in surveys, (vi) submit consumer complaints; (vii) correspond with Tock, including via email, text and other electronic messages; and (viii) conduct searches on the Site.</span></p><p><span class="B2">If you register for an account with Tock by using a third party, such as Google or Facebook, you are authorizing us to collect, maintain, and use pursuant to this Privacy Policy any information that you agreed such third party could provide to us in your privacy settings with such third party. You can modify your privacy settings with such third party.</span></p><p><span class="B2">We do not require personal information to gain access to the Site; however, you may not use certain features, products or services (including, without limitation, the Service) that require registration or receive certain materials unless such personal information is provided. You hereby consent to our collection of your personal information as outlined herein.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">Online Chats and Conferences</span></h4><p><span class="B2">As discussed above, you may choose to disclose information about yourself in chats, conferences, and other avenues of communication on the Site, if any. Such information is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in either place. Please see our<!-- --> <a class="Anchor" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> for additional guidelines about posting information on the Site.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">What about cookies and other technologies?</span></h4><p><span class="B2">Tock also uses automatic data collection technologies to collect information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns as you navigate through the Site. Information collected by Tock through automatic data collection technologies includes, but is not limited to, details of your visits to the Site (e.g., traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Site) and information about your computer and internet connection (e.g., your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system and browser type). The technologies we use for this automatic data collection include, but are not limited to, cookies, local storage, tracking pixels, and IP address logging.</span></p><p><span class="B2">Cookies are small amounts of data downloaded to your computer to track movements and behavior within web sites. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other purposes. We may collect information on the frequency that certain digital activities are accessed, how much time is spent engaging certain informational content and which links are clicked. We may link cookie information to personal information.</span></p><p><span class="B2">Local storage is similar to cookies in that it is stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.</span></p><p><span class="B2">Tracking pixels (a.k.a. beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document or in an e-mail message. Tracking pixels are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message. We do not use tracking pixels to collect personal information about you. However, we may use tracking pixels to capture statistical usage information for the Site or features or other elements on the Site. We may link tracking pixel information to personal information to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on the Site.</span></p><p><span class="B2">Tock also maintains log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on the Site, to report aggregate information to our third-party providers, to troubleshoot technical problems and for statistical analyses and fraud and abuse prevention. In the event of user abuse of the Site, we may block certain IP addresses. IP addresses may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our <a class="Anchor" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">Other Information Collected</span></h4><p><span class="B2">Certain activities will require you to create a username and password and provide other, non-personal information such as your month and day of birth, gender, preferences, etc. In addition, we may collect demographic information such as gender, zip code, information about your likes and dislikes, information about your current location, and other data that you may provide in surveys or online profiles. We may also link demographic information to personal information.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">A Special Note About Children</span></h4><p><span class="B2">The Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. No one under age 18 may provide any information to or on the Site. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 18. If you are under 18, do not use or provide any information on the Site or on or through any of its features, register on the Site, make any purchases through the Site, use any of the features of the Site or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received information from a child under 18, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please email our Privacy Officer at<!-- --> <a class="Anchor" href="mailto:privacy@tockhq.com">privacy@tockhq.com</a>.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">What happens to the information provided?</span></h4><p><span class="B2">We use the information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information, (i) to present the Site and its contents to you; (ii) to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us; (iii) to provide you with notices about your account; (iv) to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection; (v) to notify you about changes to the Site or the Service; (vi) to alert you to new developments, features and enhancements to the Site or Service and events of interest; (vii) to allow you to participate in the interactive features of the Site; (viii) to solicit feedback from you; (ix) to make updates to and to “debug” the Site or the Service; (x) to fulfill any purpose for which you provide it; and (xi) for any other purpose with your consent. We may contact you regarding third-party products or services; however, this does not mean that we have provided or traded your information to any party.</span></p><p><span class="B2">If you provide us with your email address and mobile phone number when you create an account or at any other time, you are expressly opting-in to receive email, SMS text messages, and push notifications from us relating to the Site and Services. You acknowledge that messaging and data rates may apply depending on your mobile phone service provider and that you are solely responsible for paying such rates.</span></p><p><span class="B2">If you opt-in to using location services for any Tock applications, we may collect and store information about your current location in order to enhance and customize your experience using such Tock applications (e.g., by showing you nearby Businesses).</span></p><p><span class="B2">We may use and disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. We may disclose information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy (i) to any subsidiaries and affiliates; (ii) for internal marketing and demographic studies; (iii) to our third-party providers (Businesses, third-party payment processors, strategic partners, third parties who deliver marketing messages and advertisements on our behalf, and third-party service providers); (iv) to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Tock’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which information held by Tock about the Site is among the assets transferred; (v) to our investors; (vi) to fulfill any purpose for which you provide it; and (vii) to any other third parties with your consent. Because we cannot control the activities of the third parties listed above, we are not responsible for any use of your information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p><span class="B2">We may also disclose your information (i) to enforce legal rights and comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; (ii) to enforce or apply our own<!-- --> <a class="Anchor" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; and (iii) if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Tock, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with third parties for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></p><h4><span class="D3">Opt-Out Provision</span></h4><p><span class="B2">If you would like to opt-out of having your personal information shared with parties outside of Tock, its affiliates, or its third-party providers, except to the extent required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, please email our Privacy Officer at<!-- --> <a class="Anchor" href="mailto:privacy@tockhq.com">privacy@tockhq.com</a>.</span></p><p><span class="B2">If you’d like to have your name removed from our promotional mailing list or a Business’s promotional mailing list, please email our Privacy Officer at<!-- --> <a class="Anchor" href="mailto:privacy@tockhq.com">privacy@tockhq.com</a>.
