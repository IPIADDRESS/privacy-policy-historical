    <br>
  This Policy was last updated in December 2009.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Scope</strong><br>
  <br>
  TomTom International B.V. and its parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates  (collectively “<strong>TomTom</strong>”,  “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>we</strong>”) appreciate the interest you  (“You” or “Your”) have shown in our products and services by visiting our  websites, <u><a href="http://www.tomtom.com">www.tomtom.com </a></u>or related communication channels such as TomTom HOME, TomTom WORK and  TomTom’s route planner and route widget (collectively, the "<strong>Websites</strong>"). This Privacy  Policy outlines our guidelines for the information TomTom collects when You  interact with TomTom, such as when You visit our Websites, when You use the  products and services offered by TomTom, like TomTom HOME or our TomTom LIVE  services, when You subscribe to our newsletter or when You call our Customer  Support.<br>
  <br>
  “<strong>Personal Information</strong>”  is information about You that is personally identifiable to You like Your name,  address, e-mail address, or phone number.<br>
  <br>
  “<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>”  means information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal  Information.&nbsp; Anonymous Information does  not permit identification of You.&nbsp;  Anonymous Information, such as basic usage statistics regarding Your use  of the products and services offered by TomTom, does not by itself identify You  to TomTom, though such information may be unique or consist of or contain  information that You consider personal.<br>
  In accessing the  Websites You accept all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You  also agree that TomTom may amend and/or revise this Privacy Policy at its  discretion, and You agree to be bound by these revisions and amendments. Your  Personal Information may be processed in the country where it was collected as  well as in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding  processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in Your  country. <br>
  If You do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy we  request that You immediately cease using and accessing the Websites as well as  the products and services for which You need to provide Personal Information.<br>
  <strong><br>
  <strong>Collection of Information by TomTom</strong></strong><br>
  <br>
  The Personal Information we gather from You helps us learn about our visitors  and customers. We use this information to provide You with our products and  services and the products and services of our carefully selected partners, to  develop new products and services, to better tailor the features, performance  and support of our products and services, and to offer You additional  information and opportunities.<br>
  We collect Personal Information that You submit to us voluntarily through our  Websites and Your use of our products and services. We may collect Anonymous  Information passively or actively. The types of Personal Information and  Anonymous Information we collect are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>If You set up a “MyTomTom”       account, we will collect Your contact details such as name, address,       gender, email address and country and the serial number of Your TomTom       device as well as, if appreciated, the information You provide us with in       order to receive the newsletter of Your preference. </li>
  <li>If You buy products or       services from our webstore, we will collect Your full name, the name of       Your company (if applicable), Your postal address (for shipping and       billing purposes), e-mail, phone number, and all the information we need       to process Your payment of the purchase amount and the fulfilment of Your       purchase and/or subscription, such as a bank account number or a credit       card number. </li>
  <li>If You request customer       support services for TomTom products and/or services, we will collect       Personal Information to enable us to provide customer support services to       You, including Your name, mailing address, phone number, email address,       and contact preferences. We will also collect other information about the       TomTom products You own, such as the serial numbers, date of purchase and       information related to a support or service issue, some of which might       include Personal Information. </li>
  <li>By using a bulletin board or a       chat room at our Websites, You should be aware that You are sharing all information       You post on such bulletin boards or chat rooms with other users, including       any Personal Information that You may choose to share, which shall become       public information. Please choose the information that You share       carefully.&nbsp; TomTom has no control       over and is not responsible for anyone’s use, misuse, collection or       disclosure of information You provide on a bulletin board or in a chat       room by any third party. The information presented on bulletin boards and       in chat rooms reflects the views of the individual users.</li>
  <li>By joining the TomTom       community, like TomTom MapShare, TomTom will collect Personal Information       like Your email address and any such information You will voluntarily       provide to TomTom like map corrections. This Personal Information is used       for the purpose for which You provide it to TomTom.</li>
  <li>Your user account name may be       displayed throughout our Websites (and so available to the public) and is       connected to all of Your TomTom activity. Other people can see Your posts,       uploads, feedback, ratings and associated comments. Notices sent to other       community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our       Websites refer to user accounts and specific items. If You associate Your       name with Your user account, the people to whom You have revealed Your       name will be able to identify Your TomTom activities. </li>
  <li>You may also be asked to       provide Personal Information about a person other than Yourself (for       example if You want to purchase a gift for someone and this Personal       Information is required for the fulfilment of the delivery of Your       purchase), such as name, address, email address. This Personal Information       is used only for the purpose for which You provide it to TomTom. </li>
  <li>TomTom may collect Personal       Information through surveys for market research purposes to gain a better       understanding of our customers, to improve our products and services, and       to develop new products and services. The information we collect in such       instances depends on the survey, but might include Your name, address,       age, information about Your use of our services and products and the like. </li>
  <li>If You subscribe to TomTom       location-based services like HD Traffic, TomTom may collect location data       from Your TomTom device in order to provide You with the services       requested. </li>
  <li>If You send us an email to       apply for a position with TomTom, we will collect Your email address and       the full content of Your email, included attached files, such as resumes,       and other information necessary to process Your application. </li>
</ul>
<p>You represent,  warrant and covenant that any Personal Information that You supply to TomTom is  true, complete and accurate in all respects. You agree to notify TomTom  immediately of any changes to Your Personal Information via our Websites. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cookie Policy</strong><br>
    <br>
  Our Websites use Cookies to allow TomTom to collect data about the visitors of  the Websites and users of our service (that we may associate with Personal  Information that we have collected from You) and to customise and personalise  our Websites for its viewers. A “<strong>Cookie</strong>”  is a small text file that is placed on Your hard disk by a web server and is  used by our Websites to identify Your computer whenever You visit our Websites.  TomTom uses Cookies to store Your preferences and other related information.  TomTom does not use Cookies to gather other information from Your personal  computer. Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file  directions. If You choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Websites may  not work properly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Information Collected Via Technology</strong><br>
  <br>
  As You navigate our Websites, certain Anonymous Information may also be  collected passively, including Your Internet protocol address, browser type,  and operating system. We also use Cookies and data like Uniform Resource  Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of Your visit  and the information for which You searched and viewed. We use this Anonymous  Information to measure the traffic on our Websites and to help us make our  Websites more useful. We delete this information after a period of time.<br>
  TomTom may gather  Anonymous Information from Your TomTom device when You are using it or when You  are connecting it to a computer by using TomTom HOME. This Anonymous  Information includes location information (information about Your location), information  on how long it took You to travel certain routes, traffic patterns and on any  technical glitches You may have encountered. The nature of the Anonymous  Information that Your TomTom device transmits to us will not enable us to trace  it back to an identifiable person; provided, however, You may elect to permit  us to associate such Anonymous Information with Personal Information we have  collected from You to provide You with specific location-based services that  are tailored to meet Your needs or interests, to improve our products and  services or to enforce the agreements, terms and conditions related to our  Websites, products and services. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Information  we receive from Other Sources</strong><br>
    <br>
  We may receive Personal Information about You from third parties that provide  us with data from their databases. We may add this information to the  information we have already collected from You for the purposes described in  this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does TomTom processes Personal  Information and Anonymous Information? </strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Personal Information will be       collected, processed, and used by TomTom for the purposes set out in this       Privacy Policy. </li>
  <li>Your Personal Information is       used by TomTom to perform its obligations resulting from the delivery of       the TomTom products and/or services to You, under the End-User License       Agreement, Limited Warranty, if any, or any other terms that may apply.       TomTom uses Your Personal Information to respond to Your questions and to       fulfil Your requests or to manage interactive customer programmes. TomTom       is entitled to contract third parties for its fulfilment of its obligations hereunder,       however, TomTom will not provide Your Personal Information to a third       party without Your permission, except as necessary to process Your order,       fulfil Your requests or manage the interactive customer programmes       or if compelled by law. These third parties may help TomTom to i.e.       process information, fulfil customer orders, deliver products to You,       manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess Your       interest in our products and services or to conduct customer research or       satisfaction surveys. These third parties are obligated to protect Your       Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. TomTom is and       will remain responsible for the use of Your Personal Information. </li>
  <li>TomTom uses Personal       Information to contact You via mail, via email or phone to inform You of       our (new) products and/or services, promotions we may offer, to submit a       customer survey and any other marketing activity. TomTom is entitled to       contract third parties to perform its direct marketing activities. TomTom       may use Your Personal Information to conduct market research, to improve       our products and/or services, to provide more responsive customer service       and to improve our Websites and related Communication Channels, products       and services. </li>
  <li>TomTom also uses Personal       Information to contact You, always on an “opt-in” basis, via mail, email       address or phone to inform You of product and services of our carefully       selected partners. </li>
  <li>TomTom may provide, distribute       or disclose Your Personal Information to third parties where TomTom       reasonably believes that it is required to do so to conform to legal       requirements or litigation, to protect and defend the rights or property       of TomTom or other third parties, to enforce this Privacy Policy or act to       protect the interests of its users. TomTom is also entitled to disclose       Your Personal Information for the purposes of national security or other       issues of public importance. </li>
  <li>Your Personal Information and       Anonymous Information are stored by TomTom in a central database. This       central database is used by TomTom on a “need to know” basis in accordance       with this Privacy Policy. </li>
  <li>TomTom is entitled to exchange       any Personal Information between the TomTom companies including those       based in countries within and outside the EU, for the purposes set out in       this Privacy Policy. </li>
  <li>TomTom may create Anonymous       Information records from Personal Information by excluding information       (such as Your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to       You. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyse usage patterns, to       improve all our services, to develop new services and reserve the right to       use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>We may also use Personal Information to  resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems or to prevent  potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our terms and  conditions. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>If our company or our assets       are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal       Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations       for Your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our disclosure of  Your information </strong> <br>
  We may disclose Personal Information to respond to legal  requirements, to enforce our policies, to respond to claims that a listing or  other content violates the rights of others, or to protect anyone's rights,  property, or safety. Such Personal Information will be disclosed in accordance  with applicable laws and regulations.<br>
  We may also share Your Personal Information with: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Members of TomTom’s trusted  complainant programme when we in our sole discretion believe such disclosure is  reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with an intellectual property  infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, we will  disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number,  email address and company name. </li>
  <li>Law enforcement or other governmental  officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal  investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, we will disclose  information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, zip code,  telephone number, email address, user account history and IP address.</li>
  <li>Without limiting the above, in an  effort to respect Your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from  bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose Your Personal Information to law  enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without an  official request, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except  when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of Personal Information is  necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report  suspected illegal activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note  that if You access our Websites from a shared computer or a public computer,  such as one in an internet café, certain information about You, such as Your  user account, may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after  You. <br>
    <strong>Your Choices regarding Your Personal  Information</strong><br>
    <br>
  We offer You choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of Your Personal  Information. When You receive newsletters or promotional communications from  us, You may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from  us and You have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe  instructions provided in the e-mail You receive or by contacting us directly at <u>www.tomtom.com/support</u><u> </u>or <a href="mailto:privacy@tomtom.com">privacy@tomtom.com</a>.&nbsp; However, regardless of Your indicated e-mail  preferences, we may send You service e-mails regarding our products and  services or notices of any updates to the terms and conditions or Privacy  Policy. <br>
  You may change any of the Personal Information in Your account by editing Your  account information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Accessing,  reviewing and changing Your Personal Information</strong> <br>
  You can see, review and change much of Your Personal Information  by signing in to Your TomTom account. Generally, we will not modify Your  Personal Information because it is very difficult to verify Your identity  remotely (e.g. via telephone). You must promptly update Your Personal  Information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once You make a public posting, You  may not be able to change or remove it. Upon Your request (privacy@tomtom.com),  we will close Your account and remove Your Personal Information from view as  soon as reasonably possible, based on Your account activity and in accordance  with applicable law. We do retain Personal Information from closed accounts to  comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,  troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our terms and  conditions, and take other actions permitted by law.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Transfer of Business Assets</strong><br>
  <br>
  In the event that TomTom undergoes a change of control or is sold or  transferred, or in the event that substantially all of its assets are sold or  transferred to a third party, TomTom’s website, products and services, and any  personally identifiable information collected by TomTom, will be among the  transferred assets. By using our Websites, products and/or services, You hereby  agree and consent to such transfer or assignment of Your Personal Information  collected by TomTom or to a change of control of TomTom, and You further waive  any claims that could be made against us in relation thereto.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Feedback</strong><br>
  <br>
  If You provide feedback to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose,  provided we do not associate this feedback with Your Personal Information. TomTom  will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the  Personal Information in the communication in accordance with this Privacy  Policy.<br>
  <br>
