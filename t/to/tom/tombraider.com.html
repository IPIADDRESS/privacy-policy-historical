              <p>Welcome to Eidos!</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>OUR PRIVACY 
                COMMITMENT</strong></p>
              <p>Eidos, Inc., and its subsidiaries 
                and affiliates (collectively, "Eidos") respect the privacy 
                rights of our online visitors and recognizes the importance of 
                protecting all information that you may choose to share with us. 
                To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy 
                Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store, 
                and use the information you provide us.</p>

                <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy.asp">ESRB's Privacy Online

                that our website's information disclosure practices are responsible 
                and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily 
                undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have 
                been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established 
                online information collection and use practices. As part of this 
                privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our websites

              <p><strong><a name="q1"></a>Q1. What information does this Privacy Statement 
                cover?</strong></p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected 
                on the websites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does 
                not apply to any other information collected by Eidos, Inc. through 
                any other means.</p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing 
                of personal information collected on and after the date that this 
                Privacy Policy is posted.</p>
              <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information 
                submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information 
                that may be collected by Eidos, Inc. offline. This Privacy Policy 
                applies only to websites maintained by Eidos, Inc., and not to 
                our international affiliates, or any websites maintained by other 
                companies or organizations to which we link. Eidos, Inc. is therefore 
                not responsible for the content or activities provided on those 
                websites.</p>
              <p>Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all 
                applicable laws.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="q2"></a>Q2. What types of personally identifiable information 
                do we collect about our guests?</strong></p>
              <p>We don't require personal information to access 
                our website. However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, 
                you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our website. 
                Personal information is information that identifies you and may 
                be used to contact you. To offer our guests certain features on 
                our website, we collect several types of personal information.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><b><u>Children</u></b></p>
              <p>We don't knowingly collect personal information from children 
                under 13. We take children's privacy seriously, and encourage 
                parents to play an active role in their children's online experience 
                at all times.</p>
              <p><b><u>Information You Provide to Us</u></b></p>
              <p>All of the personal information we receive comes directly from 
                our guests. We collect personal information from our guests to:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>register for our general and title specific website</li>
              <li>subscribe to our newsletters</li>
              <li>join our message boards and forums</li>
              <li>participate in polls, surveys, and questionnaires</li>
              <li>participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions</li>
              <li>use e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend features</li>
              <li>purchase a product at one of our online stores</li>
              <li>receive customer or technical support</li>
            </ol>
              <p>Typically, this information includes:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>name</li>
              <li>email address</li>
              <li>telephone number</li>
              <li>shipping and billing address, and</li>
              <li>for those purchasing products online, credit 
                  card information.</li>
            </ol>
              <p>Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal 
                information (known as demographic information) such as your age 
                or date of birth, gender, hobbies, occupation, platform preferences, 
                and other game ownership and preferences. This demographic information 
                may be associated with your personal information.</p>
              <p><b><u>Information Collected Through Technology</u></b></p>
              <p>We collect information through technology to make our websites 
                more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come 
                to one of our websites, we collect your IP address. An IP address 
                is often associated with the portal through which you enter the 
                Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, 
                or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally 
                identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information 
                regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts 
                of our websites. We may combine this information with personally 
                identifiable information.</p>
              <p><b><u>Cookies</u></b></p>
              <p>Our websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information 
                that a Website sends to your computer while you are viewing the 
                Website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. 
                For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging 
                in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website 
                will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer 
                warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to 
                turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like 
                Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser 
                is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn 
                the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, 
                you won't have access to many features that make your web experience 
                smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services 
                may not function properly.</p>
              
            <p><u><b>Web Beacons</b></u></p>
              <p>Our websites use a variety of technical methods for tracking 
                purposes, including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces 
                of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. 
                We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns 
                on our websites, such as the frequency with which our users visit 
                various parts of our websites. These technical methods may involve 
                the transmission of information either directly to us or to another 
                party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We 
                also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send 
                our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails 
                or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use 
                of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is 
                personally identifiable. </p>
              <p>Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left 
                our Websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must 
                read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal 
                information will be handled on their website.</p>
              <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
              
            <p><strong><a name="q3"></a>Q3. How is your personally identifiable information used and 
              shared?</strong></p>
            <p>We don't share, sell, or rent your personal information to 
              third parties without your consent. We will only collect information 
              to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and 
              our legitimate business objectives.</p>
            <p><b><u>Eidos, Inc. Tools and Updates</u></b></p>
            <p>Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us 
              is used to provide services like newsletter subscription, updates 
              on special events, game news, and email announcements of interest 
              to our users. If you register for access to our forums or message 
              boards, we will use your personal information to enable you to view 
              and post messages on the boards. However, you should understand 
              that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that 
              allow you to communicate with members of the online community. As 
              such, whenever you give out personal information in public areas, 
              that information can be collected and used by people you don't 
              know.</p>
            <p><b><u>Operational Uses</u></b></p>
            <p>We may also use your personal information for other purposes such 
              as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information 
              to send you administrative communications either about your account 
              with us or about features of our websites, including any future 
              changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We occasionally use other companies, agents, or contractors to 
              perform services necessary to our operations. For example, we have 
              partnered with other companies for our sales sites both physical 
              product and digital downloads to process sales transactions including 
              the processing of credit cards. We also provide postal addresses 
              to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes. In the course of 
              providing such services, these companies may have contact with your 
              personally identifying information. These entities have agreed to 
              securely store and maintain the personal information received from 
              us.</p>
            <p><b><u>Aggregate Information</u></b></p>
            <p>Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and 
              make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with 
              information about other individuals (aggregating your information 
              with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics 
              (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable 
              to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of 
              this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy 
              on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, 
              and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting 
              non-personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p><b><u>Business Information</u></b></p>
            <p>For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted 
              to us in a business capacity different from information we receive 
              in a non-business capacity. Personal information submitted to us 
              in a business capacity (e.g. resumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may 
              be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>
            <p><b><u>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</u></b></p>
            <p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more 
              of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may 
              be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase 
              a business, the personally identifiable information received with 
              that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, 
              if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, 
              we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the 
              purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the 
              same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments 
              to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph will also 
              apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
            <p><b><u>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect 
              the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others</u></b></p>
            <p>We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith 
              that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, 
              to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce 
              our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or 
              game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety 
              and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the 
              safety and security of our websites or third parties.</p>
            <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
            <p><strong><a name="q4"></a>Q4. What choices do you have about the collection, use, 
              and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information 
              you submit to us. If at any time you decide to remove your personal 
              information from our database, you may do so by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@eidos.com">privacy@eidos.com</a>,

            <p><strong><a name="q5"></a>Q5. What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard 
              your personally identifiable information?</strong></p>
            <p>The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely 
              important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, 
              and physical security measures to protect your personal information 
              from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we 
              review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology 
              and methods. However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, 
              no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.</p>
