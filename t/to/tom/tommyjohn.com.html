opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other
advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can
access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer
choice and privacy, at

opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device
and browser that you wish to have opted-out.
</strong>
For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out
will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out
on each device.
