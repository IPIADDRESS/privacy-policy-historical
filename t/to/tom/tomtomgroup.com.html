"<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>" means information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information.&nbsp; Anonymous Information does not permit identification of You.&nbsp; Anonymous Information, such as basic usage statistics regarding Your use of the products and services offered by TomTom, does not by itself identify You to TomTom, though such information may be unique or consist of or contain information that You consider personal.
<br>
In accessing the Websites You accept all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You also agree that TomTom may amend and/or revise this Privacy Policy at its discretion, and You agree to be bound by these revisions and amendments.
