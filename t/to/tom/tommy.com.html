<p>PVH Brands Australia is committed to handling your personal information/ data in an open and transparent way.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to PVH Brands Australia Limited (ACN 165 485 290) and its related bodies corporate (collectively referred to as “PVH Brands Australia”, “we”, “our” and “us” and severally referred to as a “PVH Brands Australia entity”).</p>
<p>PVH Brands Australia is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and Privacy Act 1993 (NZ). We will only collect and use personal information in accordance with our legal obligations and this Policy. ‘Personal information’ means information which identifies you as an individual or from which you can reasonably be identified.</p>
<p>PVH Brands Australia may also be subject to the requirements of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), as it may (from time to time) collect personal data of EU residents or offer goods and services to individuals in the EU. As part of our Privacy compliance framework we have appointed a ‘data protection officer’ to monitor and advise on compliance with the GDPR and with internal privacy policies and procedures, and their contact details can be found in this Policy.</p>
<p>This Policy outlines our personal information management practices. It relates to the personal information that we collect from customers, suppliers, employees, contractors, visitors to our website, any apps we may use, social media and any other digital services or collection methods that we may employ. By providing your personal information to PVH Brands Australia, you consent to and acknowledge our personal information handling practices as outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless you tell us to the contrary by contacting our Privacy Contact Officer/ Data Protection Officer.</p>
<p>There may be additional privacy notices and terms that are relevant to you depending on the nature of your dealings with us (e.g. use of our online sites, membership of loyalty programs, entry into competitions etc).</p>
<p>Where we can, we will allow you to deal with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym. However, in some circumstances, this may not allow us to be able to provide you with a service (such as deliveries etc). We will inform you if it is possible for an interaction to occur on an anonymous basis and, where it is, it will be optional for you to provide personal information.<br>

<p>Your personal information may be disclosed to other PVH Brands Australia entities, business partners and service providers in Australia and overseas.</p>

<h3 id="government-identifiers">Use of Government Identifiers</h3>

This allows us to offer increased personalisation and functionality.</p>
<p>In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personal information except with your explicit permission. Your web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to your browser.
