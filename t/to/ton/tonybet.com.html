We may share Your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Third-parties that We work with and have an appropriate agreement with, for delivering to You secure, efficient and legal services;</li>
	<li>Third-parties of applicable governmental and/or regulatory authorities. We may also disclose Your personal data with regulatory bodies if there is a suspect that You may be involved in a breach of Our rules or governing laws and regulations. Those regulatory bodies may then use Your personal information to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures;</li>
	<li>Third-parties that You have consented to sharing Your information with.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information that is non-personal or We have anonymized, what means so that the information cannot personally identify You, is not the subject to any restrictions under this Privacy policy. We may share such information with other third-parties for advertising or any other purposes.</p>

<p>Please be noted that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any Third-party websites, services or applications, even though they might be accessible, downloadable, or otherwise distributed on the TonyBet website. You should always review their privacy practices carefully before providing personal Information to such third-parties.</p>

<h2><u>Retention</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We keep Your information for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was originally obtained (see How We use information We collect) unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law. Generally, We will retain information for not more than 10 years after closure of Your account. In certain circumstances We may retain some of Your information indefinitely (e.g. information that is needed for complying with responsible gambling and self-exclusion). We are taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the privacy of Your information is maintained upon disposal.</p>

<p>It’s important to highlight that We do not accept individuals under the age of 18 (or 21, where applicable), and We do not knowingly record or retain any information from such individuals. If on completion of age verification, We detect that the customer is underage, We will confiscate any winnings and return deposit or remaining balance, and We will take reasonable measures to promptly close any relevant accounts and remove any records where possible, other than such information that will allow Us to identify and prevent future access from such individuals.</p>

<h2><u>Your Choices &amp; Obligations</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are taking all reasonable steps to ensure that any information that We collect from You is accurate and verified.</p>

<p>You are entitled to see the Personal Data We hold about You. Moreover, You may ask Us to make any necessary changes to ensure that Your Personal Data is accurate and kept up to date.</p>

However, this period may be extended by two further months if necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The requested personal data will be provided to You on TonyBet website. However, this shall not apply if You already have the information. Any manifestly unfounded or excessive requests, in particular because of their repetitive character, can be refused or charged with an administration fee. You may also request Us to transmit Your personal data to another service provider (where technically feasible). For any additional information or help, You may contact Us. We are not responsible for protecting the data that has been received/held by You.</p>

<p><strong>Rectification</strong>. By contacting Us, You may ask Us to change, correct or update Your Personal Data in certain cases, particularly if it is inaccurate.

<p><strong>Withdraw a consent.</strong> Where We rely on Your consent, You have the right to withdraw or decline Your consent at any time and where We rely on legitimate interests, You have the right to object.

<ul>
	<li>by clicking on the “unsubscribe” in Your subscribed e-mails and selecting the category You do not wish to receive;</li>

<h2><u>Other Important Information</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em><u>Security</u></em></h3>

<p>We are taking care in implementing and maintaining the security of the Services and Your Personal data. We regularly monitor Our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. If You want to see more details, please visit Our Security Policy.</p>

<h3><em><u>Contact information</u></em></h3>

<p>We are doing everything We can to make Our Services transparent, reliable, fair and lawful. If you have any questions or complaints, please contact Us, by phone, e-mail, live chat or Contact form. If contacting Us does not resolve Your question or complaint, You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by TonyBet before the competent data protection authorities. TonyBet’s supervisory authority is Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate (Andmekaitse Inspektsioon).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We understand that keeping Your information secured is vital. Therefore, every day We work on improving appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of Our services, systems and processes. This helps Us protect the information We have against misuse and also ensures the continuity of Our services. However, this does not mean that Our systems are immune to problems. If problems are detected, We would like to receive Your notice or help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><u>How We keep Your information safe?</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All information transmitted online is encrypted using advanced logarithm combinations. All communication between You and TonyBet is encrypted to the maximum strength supported by Your browser using 256 Bit SSL encryption.</p>

<p>Since You register or log-in, all information sent to and from TonyBet website is encrypted using 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software. This system ensures that all the information You provide using TonyBet website (such as your Personal Data) is automatically protected. We secure Your private information using GoDaddy SSL Certificates.</p>

<p>Moreover, We have excellent fraud team and advanced systems for detection and prevention of suspicious or illegal activities. Any account involved in suspicious activity will be suspended and investigated. If You have any doubts that Your account was compromised (e.g. unusual changes in the balance or an email notification of a password change without any action by You), please change your password and contact TonyBet <a href="https://tonybet.com/contacts">customer support</a> service immediately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><u>How You can protect Your data?</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are a few things You can do to keep Your account secure:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Never share Your online account. </strong>You should not share Your account or use another person’s account even though the person you would be sharing with is your family member or a friend.&nbsp; Moreover, please keep in mind that to share Your account is strictly forbidden as described in Our Regulation.</li>
	<li><strong>Protect Your password.</strong> Do not use Your password anywhere else online. Your password should be difficult to guess. Avoid including your name or common words.</li>
	<li><strong>Use strong passwords.</strong> Make your password as random as possible, but easy for you to remember. Your password should be long enough, unconventional, a mix of different types of characters, better if not a dictionary word. Don't use numbers or combinations associated with other personally identifiable information as all or even part of your passwords.</li>
	<li><strong>Change passwords regularly</strong>, especially when there is any doubt that they may have been compromised.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Never share Your log in information.</strong> Do not divulge personal information about your account including passwords to anyone – even people who claim to be from customer service or security. Keep in mind that We will never ask You for Your password.</li>
	<li><strong>Do not write down your password or save it on your computer or mobile device</strong>. A Post-It note stuck to the outside of Your laptop or mobile phone is "akin to leaving your keys in your car".</li>
	<li><strong>Do not leave your computer or mobile device unlocked.</strong> It can take only seconds for someone to use this easy access and get the information they need for further malicious activities. Moreover, all it takes is a single mishap where your device slips out of your pocket or briefcase at a restaurant or on public transportation, and your data could wind up in the hands of someone who will use it maliciously.</li>
	<li><strong>Do not use the same passwords</strong> for your operation systems and software/accounts passwords.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't save passwords in your browser</strong>. Common practice of 'remembering passwords' in browsers is a dangerous practice. Indeed, should someone gain access to your computer or mobile device, they'd be able to easily access any accounts for which you've stored login credentials in your browser.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep your anti-virus software up-to-date.</strong> Run a good anti-virus protection program, do periodic scans for spyware, avoid clicking on suspicious email links or websites.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep your operating system, browser, and plugins up-to-date.</strong> These updates contain critical security patches that will protect your computer or mobile device from recently discovered threats. Failing to install these updates means your computer/mobile device is at risk.</li>
	<li><strong>Make sure your firewall is secure</strong>. Firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs, viruses or spyware before they infiltrate in your system.</li>
	<li><strong>Avoid logging in to your TonyBet account on public computers</strong> – e.g. libraries, internet cafes, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Avoid transactions on public Wi-Fi.</strong> Unlike your home computer, use of public hotspots involves security compromises. It is easy for other users to intercept your data, so be careful about what information you send while connected.</li>
	<li><strong>Secure your Wi-Fi network</strong> at home or workplace. It's always recommended to secure your wireless network with a password. This prevents unauthorized individuals within proximity to hijack your wireless network. Even if they're merely attempting to get free Wi-Fi access, you don't want to inadvertently share private information with other people who are using your network without permission.</li>
	<li><strong>Look for key markers.</strong> We rely on universally accepted security protocol HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) to protect users and keep their transactions secure. Therefore, Our website will show a green marker in the browser URL and link address will start with https instead of http or www. Always check the name of sender in the email carefully before clicking on any attachment or links. Most malware attacks are sent through bogus email IDs.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><u>HAS YOUR ACCOUNT BEEN COMPROMISED?</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your account may have been compromised if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There have been changes to your account details that you didn't commit, such as your e-mail, home address or phone number.</li>
	<li>There has been activity within your account that was not done by you. This could include deposits or withdrawals, or bets placed.</li>
	<li>You have received an email notification of a password change without any action by you.</li>
</ul>

<p>If You have any doubts that Your account was compromised, please change your password and contact TonyBet <a href="https://tonybet.com/contacts">customer support</a> service immediately.</p>
