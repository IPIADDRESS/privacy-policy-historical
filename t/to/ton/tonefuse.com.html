	<h2 class="title">Privacy Policies</h2>

	<p><b>Effective
	Date:  October 13, 2014</b></p>


	<p>ToneFuse
	operates a personalized advertising delivery service that leverages
	the power of music.  Our clients are lyric publishers and music
	service providers, such as MusicMatch, SongLyrics and
	SongMeanings and the advertisers who want to reach music fans through
	these services.  The purpose of this policy is to inform users about
	the types of user information we receive or collect in order to
	deliver more relevant advertisement to them and how to use their
	devices to control it. This Privacy Policy governs the collection,
	use and disclosure of information by ToneFuse and its affiliated
	companies. This
	Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the <a href="tos.php">Terms
	of Service Agreement</a>,
	which governs your use of the ToneFuse Services in
	general.</p>


	<p><u><b>Information
	We Collect</b></u></p>

	<p><b>Registration
	Data:</b>  When you register with one of our clients, they may ask
	you to provide certain information such as your birth year, gender,
	zip code, income level, music interests, etc.  When appropriate, our
	clients share this information with us and we use it to build
	anonymous user profiles that enable us to deliver more relevant
	advertising to users of their service.  We typically do not receive
	personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or
	email address.</p>

	<p><b>Internet
	Activity</b>:  When you visit a clients' service, they may enable
	us to track your activity on the service by, for example, tracking
	the pages you visit, the types of songs and lyrics you access or
	download, the artists you follow, the songs you like or dislike, how
	much time you spent on a page, which advertisements you clicked, what
	you search for and so on.  This information becomes part of the
	anonymous user profile that we build and use to make predictions
	about what types of advertisements might be of most interest to you
	and people like you. 
	</p>

	<p><b>Log
	File and Server Information:</b>  Web and application servers create
	log files automatically as part of the way they are configured. 
	Information in a log or server file might include your IP address,
	browser type, Internet service provider, date and time stamps, media
	access control (MAC) address, file requests and other information. 
	This information is helpful to us in building more accurate user
	profiles.</p>

	<p><b>Device
	Information:</b>  When you access a clients' service from a
	computer, mobile phone, tablet, automobile or other electronic
	device, we, with our clients' consent, collect information about
	your device.  This information may include your IP address, browser
	type and other information about the software and hardware you are
	using.  If you access our clients' service from a mobile device, we
	collect and record information as to the device type, operating
	system as well as unique identifiers such as Android ID, VIN and MAC
	address, IDFA, carrier or other information specific to the device. 
	</p>

	<p><b>Location
	Information:</b>  If your device is enabled to provide real-time
	location information, we may also be able to include that information
	in the user profiles we build.  You can always choose to disable this
	feature on your device if you no longer want it to be activated.  If
	your location is disabled, we may estimate or make assumptions about
	your location based upon other information we collect.</p>

	<p><b>Information
	Obtained from Third Parties:</b>   In addition to the information we
	collect from our clients platforms, we also collect information from
	third parties.  This includes marketing companies and information
	service providers that collect and sell information about consumers. 
	It may also include social media websites and applications or
	services that you have registered to use.  If these sites have a
	relationship with any of our clients, they may automatically provide
	information about you in order to provide you with their services. 
	You can use the controls or tools available through these social
	media sites to opt-out of sharing going forward, but it will not
	affect the data previously shared with us. 
	</p>

	<p><b>Friends:
	 </b>Your friends may also store information about you that is
	accessible to us through our clients' services.  We use some of that
	same information to deliver customized advertising to you. 
	</p>

	<p><u><b>Information
	Collection Technologies Used</b></u></p>

	<p><b>Cookies:</b>
	 ToneFuse and its clients use “cookies” to help manage and report
	your interaction with their services.  A cookie is a file that a
	server writes to your hard drive.  It contains an alphanumeric
	identifier unique to your device.  Our clients use cookies primarily
	to collect information that enables them, for example, to
	authenticate your login credentials and otherwise manage your use of
	their service.  We use information from cookies mainly to create more
	accurate user profiles so that we can deliver more relevant
	advertisements to you and to compile and report more accurate
	aggregate statistical information to our clients.  ToneFuse and its
	clients use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session
	cookies expire when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies
	remain on your hard drive for longer periods of time.  You can remove
	persistent cookies by following the instructions in your browser. 
	ToneFuse does not control how your browser control settings operate
	to block or delete cookies.</p>

	<p><b>Beacons
	and Tracking Pixels:</b>  ToneFuse and its clients use technology
	known as beacons or tracking pixels.  These are very small images
	that are imbedded in content on a web or application page.  When
	content containing a beacon is accessed, the beacon transmits
	anonymous information to a server.  ToneFuse and its clients use that
	information primarily to manage content and to measure the
	effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  ToneFuse also uses
	information from beacons and tracking pixels to build more accurate
	user profiles. 
	</p>

	<p><b>Advanced
	Algorithms:</b>  ToneFuse also uses advanced, proprietary algorithms
	to statistically infer information about users using data available
	from the operating system and other sources.  This technology helps
	us to build more complete user profiles without placing cookies on
	your devices.  
	</p>

	<p><u><b>How
	We Use The Information We Collect</b></u></p>

	<p><b>User
	Profiles:</b>  We use the information we receive and collect from the
	technologies described above about to build user profiles based upon
	music preferences.  We then use these profiles to customize and
	personalize the advertising and other content delivered to users of
	our clients' services, to determine how well that advertising
	performs, and to aggregate traffic, usage, demographic and other data
	of interest to our clients.  For example, an advertiser might want to
	know if fans of a particular musical artist are more likely to
	purchase a particular make and model of car.  Using our technology
	and database of user profiles, we will be able to provide them with
	statistical information to enable them to deliver the most relevant
	ads to the most relevant audience.</p>

	<p><b>Personally
	identifiable Information:</b>  We do not use or share personally
	identifiable information with third parties except as described in
	this policy or at the time of collection.  We may, however, share any
	information we have about you (including information that might
	personally identify you) to comply with the law of legal process, to
	protect our legal rights and the rights of our clients, to guard
	against fraud, for risk management purposes, and to protect the
	safety and security of the public.  We may also share your user
	profile (including any personally identifying information we might
	have) with our affiliated companies and our successors in interest in
	the event of a corporate reorganization, merger or sale of assets.</p>

	<p><u><b>Opting
	Out of Ad Tracking and Customized Advertising</b></u></p>

	<p><b>On
	Your Computer:</b>  You can remove persistent cookies from your
	computer by following the instructions in your browser.  To learn
	more about how the online advertising industry collects and uses
	information about users to deliver customized advertising and to
	control whether you want to receive customized ads from participating
	service providers, you can visit the following websites: 
	<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>
	and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.
	  
	</p>

	<p><b>On
	Your Mobile and Tablet Devices:</b> If you use an iOS device and you
	do not want to receive customized advertising, you may opt-out by
	accessing the iAd Network Advertising Settings page from the browser
	on your device.  On newer iOS devises, you can also limit ad tracking
	under “Settings” on the home screen. If you use an Android based
	device, you can visit Google's Ad Settings page from a browser on
	your device and make your choices there.  
	</p>

	<p>ToneFuse
	does not control how your browser or mobile operating systems operate
	to allow you to control advertising tracking and customization.  If
	you have any questions about these control mechanisms, contact your
	service provider directly.</p>

	<p><u><b>Your
	California Privacy Rights</b></u></p>

	<p>Section
	1798.83 of California's Civil Code permits users who are California
	residents to request and obtain, free of charge, one time a year a
	list of the third parties to whom we disclosed their personal
	information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding
	calendar year and the categories of personal information disclosed to
	those third parties.  If you are a California resident and you wish
	to make such a request or if you have any questions about ToneFuse's
	information sharing practices, you may contact us by sending us an
	email or writing to us at the address set forth below.</p>

	<p>California
	law also provides individuals under the age of 18 the right to remove
	personally identifiable information they may have posted about
	themselves on the Internet.  While we do not currently operate any
	services that enable such postings, we believe California residents
	should be aware of these rights.    
	</p>

	<p><u><b>International
	Users</b></u></p>

	<p>ToneFuse's
	services are controlled from ToneFuse's offices in the United
	States.  If you interact with our clients' platforms from a
	location outside the U.S., please be advised that any information
	that is collected by us as described herein may be processed in or
	transferred to the U.S. and other locations where privacy protections
	may not be as comprehensive as those in the location where you live. 
	We will, however, use your information only as provided in this
	Privacy Policy.  By using the clients' service, you affirmatively
	consent to our use of your information as described in this Policy.</p>

	<p><u><b>Children</b></u></p>

	<p>ToneFuse
	does not knowingly collect personal information about anyone under
	the age of 13.</p>

	<p><u><b>Security</b></u></p>

	<p>We
	use commercially reasonable electronic and physical security measures
	to protect user information against loss, misuse, unauthorized
	disclosure and alteration and we train our employees on the
	importance of protecting user information, particularly when it
	contains personally identifying information.</p>

	<p><u><b>Changes
	to this Policy</b></u></p>

	<p>We
	reserve the right to change or update this policy and will notify
	users of the changes by updating this page, so please check this page
	periodically for updates.  
	</p>

	Us</b></u></p>
