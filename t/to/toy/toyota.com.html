<p><a name="intro"></a>This document describes Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.'s ("Toyota") policy regarding information received about you during visits to our Web site. The amount and type of information received depends on how you use the site. These privacy provisions apply solely to Toyota's online information collection activities on this Web site and are not applicable to information collection practices Toyota may be engaged in elsewhere.</p>
<p><u>By using this site, you signify your assent to the Toyota Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so please visit us frequently.</u></p>
<p><a name="norep"></a><span class="body01B">No Representation or Warranty</span><br>
Your confidential use of this site cannot be guaranteed by Toyota. Toyota shall not be responsible for any harm that you or any person may suffer as a result of a breach of confidentiality in respect to your use of this site or any information you transmitted to this site.</p>
<p><a name="normal"></a><span class="body01B">Normal Web Site Usage</span><br>
You can visit Toyota's Web site to read vehicle product information or use our online tools, such as the calculators and configurators, without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information (other than, in some cases, your zip code). When you do this, we collect and store the name of your Internet service provider, the browser (including available plug-ins and browser functionality) and type of machine you are using, the IP address, the Web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests.</p>
<p>We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal Web site usage, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, or phone number.</p>
<p><a name="collection"></a><span class="body01B">Collection and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</span><br>
There are instances where Toyota requests information about you to provide you with a service or information, such as new vehicle information alerts, promotions and mailed brochures. Depending upon the type of request, the information we collect may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, date of birth and what service or information you have requested. Your personal information is collected and stored by Toyota in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data. The information you provide is also used by Toyota to improve the services we provide you.</p>
<p>Your personal information may be shared with our business partners to assist us in fulfilling your request. We may also share your personal information with companies affiliated with Toyota, our private distributors, and our authorized dealers and dealer advertising associations.</p>
<p>From time to time, Toyota may request information about you to enable you to participate in promotional activities, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, blogs and chats ("Programs").  Sometimes Programs are made available through the joint efforts of Toyota and an unaffiliated business partner. If you choose to participate, we may use the information you provide in connection with the Program.  For example, we may send you email messages related to the Program or your account activity, or for selection and notification of sweepstakes or contest winners. Your personal information may also be shared with our business partner and may also be used by our business partner if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company. If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies and this privacy policy will not apply to that company's use of your information.  Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the personal information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program.  If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Policy, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any personal information.</p>  
<p>Please remember that blogs are public areas on Toyota's Web site and chat rooms may be public areas on Toyota's Web site.  Please refer to the Program details.  Any information posted in these areas can be viewed by other visitors or Internet users. You should not post personal information in these areas.</p>
<p>For some features on Toyota's Web site, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you wish to invite your friends to participate in a Program offered on Toyota's Web site or forward particular content from Toyota's Web site to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' email addresses. Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the Program and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a name="surveys"></a><span class="body01B">Surveys</span><br>
From time to time we may conduct surveys on Toyota's Web site.  If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain demographic information (such as your gender, date of birth and zip code).  We may use the information that you submit, including your responses to the survey questions, for the purposes identified to you prior to your participation in the survey.  In some cases, we may publish the results of the survey but will do so only as aggregate information and you will not be individually identified.  As we may be conducting certain surveys with our business partners or other third parties, we may also share the results of those surveys with those third parties but will not identify individuals.</p>
<p><a name="disclosure"></a><span class="body01B">Disclosure for Legal Purposes</span><br>
Toyota reserves the right to disclose any personally identifiable information or other information we collect through this Web site or otherwise if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that the disclosure is necessary in order to (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of law or to comply with legal process served on us; (c) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Toyota, Toyota's Web site or its users, or third party licensors of any material on Toyota's Web site; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health or safety of the users of Toyota's Web site or the general public.</p>
<p><a name="kids"></a><span class="body01B">We Do Not Seek Information from Children</span><br>
Toyota's Web site is not intended for children under the age of 13.  Toyota does not knowingly collect personal information from children that young.  If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit your email address or any other personal information to us through the Toyota Web site.</p>
<p><a name="update"></a><span class="body01B">How to Update Your Information</span><br>
If you provided Toyota with personally identifiable information through the Owners section of toyota.com or toyotaownersonline.com, you may review and update that information by clicking on the Owners link on the home page of toyota.com, or going to the home page of toyotaownersonline.com, logging in and then clicking on "Update Profile".</p>
<p>From time to time Toyota collects personally identifiable information in connection with Programs.  There may be times when you can access and update the information you provided as part of your participation in the Program.  Please see the section of this Web site concerning the specific Program to determine if you are able to access your information and how to do so.</p>
<p><a name="cookies"></a><span class="body01B">Use of Cookies</span><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to the hard drive of a user's computer for record-keeping purposes so that we may track site and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most major Web sites. By showing how and when visitors use the site, cookies help Toyota to track those areas of our site that are popular and which areas are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed.</p> 
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, like the configurator areas, will not function properly if you do so. Also, we will not be able to recognize you as a visitor over time.</p>
<p><a name="third"></a><span class="body01B">Third-Party Advertising Companies</span><br>
Toyota shares Web site usage information about visitors to our Web site with one or more reputable third-party advertising companies for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of our online advertising initiatives. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising companies note some of the pages you visit on our Web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). We may also utilize Web beacons to determine the correlation between Toyota purchasers and the online sites they visit. The information collected by our third-party advertising companies through the use of these pixel tags and Web beacons is not personally identifiable.
