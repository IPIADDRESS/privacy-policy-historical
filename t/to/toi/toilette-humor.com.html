        <p class="black"><strong>A Personal Note:<br>
          What happened to me when I blocked cookies from being stored on my Browser.</strong></p>
        <p class="black">This felt funny to me. I blocked my cookies about a month ago just because I thought it was a good idea. Then I promptly forgot that I'd even done it. Suddenly the internet look a whole lot different than I was used to. I didn't know why and I couldn't see any of the ads on our Toilette-Humor website. Then I paniced because I couldn't see any of the icons that allowed people to “share the webpage with a friend” either. It took me an entire day to figure out what had happened. <br>
          <br>
          Our browsers have a lot to do with whether we can allow cookies or not. You might want to turn them off (per some of the instructions above) and then test your browsing experience to determine if this is really what you want to do. </p>
