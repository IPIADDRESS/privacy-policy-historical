			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Company may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties.

			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Site.

				How We Share Your Information
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp;Company will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others.&nbsp; Company may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you.&nbsp; If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Company (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Company will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our Site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Company, our users or others.&nbsp; Please note we may not provide notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Non-Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Company services.
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Company allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Company does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Company to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
			</div>
<div>
				You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Company privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.

			</div>
<div class="page-title">
				How We Protect Your Information
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				Company uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Company and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Company makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>
				To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Company, at all times.
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div class="page-title">
				Compromise of Personal Information
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div>

<div class="page-title">
				Your Choices About Your Information
			</div>
<div>

<div>
				&nbsp;
			</div>
<div class="page-title">
				Children's Privacy
			</div>
<div>
				Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.&nbsp; The Site is designed to be of service and interest to users ages 13 and older. If you are a minor over the age of 13, you may only use this Site with the permission and under the supervision of your parent or guardian.

			</div>
<div>
				Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
			</div>
<div>
				&nbsp;

<div>
					We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our Site as is explained in detail in our Site’s Terms of Use.&nbsp; In the course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or other advertising technology may be placed on your browser.&nbsp; This advertising technology uses information derived from your visits to the Site to target advertising within this Site.&nbsp; This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you (sometimes called “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising” or “OBA”).&nbsp; We also use web beacons, provided by third-party advertising companies, to help manage and optimize our online advertising.&nbsp; Web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this Site, to learn which banner ads bring users to our Site and to deliver more relevant advertising.&nbsp;
				</div>
