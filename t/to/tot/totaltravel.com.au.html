That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Totaltravel.com PTY LTD, Incorporated, (“TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD”). <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it? </b><br>
<br>
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" . When a visitor requests a page from any Web Site within the TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. <br>
<br>
<b>Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties? </b><br>
<br>
We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors. <br>
<br>
<b>What are cookies? </b><br>
<br>
From time to time, TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD or its advertisers may send a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD's Network of Web Sites you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our Site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. <br>
<br>
<b>What information do you collect when I register for something? </b><br>
<br>
TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD offers access to some services that are free but that require registration. We may use your registration contact information to send notification of TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We also may share that information with our clients. Our clients may send you promotional material that is related to the topic of the service for which you registered unless you have chosen not to receive it. We may also use your IP address internally and share it with third parties. <br>
<br>
<b>What other information do you request? </b><br>
<br>
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists etc.). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent. <br>
<br>
We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD products and services. Except as stated above, TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD will not send you email that you have not agreed to receive. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive mailings from other third party companies. <br>
When you sign up for an TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you outside the TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD Network in any way. <br>
<br>
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. <br>
<br>
<b>What information do you collect when I purchase something? </b><br>
<br>
If you are purchasing something from an TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD media property, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related products and services. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose without your express permission. <br>
<br>
Wherever TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. <br>
<br>
<b>Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties? </b><br>
<br>
TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD will disclose personal information and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: <br>
    1)    Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD, <br>
    2)   Protect and defend the rights or property of the TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD Network of Sites and related properties, or visitors to the TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD Network of Sites and related properties, <br>

    4)   Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities. <br>
<br>
TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD reserves the right to transfer all such information in connection with the sale of all or part of TOTALTRAVEL.COM PTY LTD's capital stock or assets. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. We are not responsible for such third party privacy policies or how they treat information about their users<br>
