				<p>We will only collect personally identifiable information that you choose to provide. You can choose not to provide certain information. Where possible, we will enable you to select how we will use this information (for example, by choosing to opt-in or opt-out of receiving special promotional offers).</p>

				<h2>Automatically received information</h2>
				<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's Internet Protocol ('IP'). When a visitor requests a page from any Web Site within our network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and for security purposes and to investigate misuse of the network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. </p>
				<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use 'cookies' and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses totaltravel.com.
