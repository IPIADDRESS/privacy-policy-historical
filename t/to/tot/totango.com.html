        <p>This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices that Totango LLC. (“Totango”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) employs in providing the Totango Service (the “Service”) to our customers, including their personnel (collectively, “Customer(s)”). It explains what data we collect, including Personally our Identifiable Information (defined below), about (i) Customers; and (ii) the customers and clients of our Customers (“End Users”), and how we collect, use and retain such data. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our clients have engaged Totango.</p>
        <p>1. Introduction. We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information that is shared with us as part of the Service. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.</p>

We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.</p>
        <p>3.3. Transactions. We may collect or obtain information, including Personally Identifiable Information, from each Customer in order to complete the Customer’s subscription to the Service.

We may use the tools, software or services of third party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case the terms of use and/or privacy policy of said third party service provider shall also apply to the transaction.&nbsp;These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>

        <p>4.8. Email Opt-Out. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), (accessable from our blog page) we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.

        <p>4..9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information or any information that we receive in connection with the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Totango, our Customers, End Users, or the public.</p>
        <p>5. Anonymous Information. We may use Anonymous Information (defined below), or disclose it to third party service providers, to provide, improve and/or develop the Service. From time to time, we may disclose Anonymous Information as part of our participation in an industry wide benchmark for the benefit of the online software community. Each Customer may opt-out from such benchmarks at any time by emailing us at&nbsp;privacy@totango.com. “Anonymous Information” means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information, about the use of the Service.</p>

We may transfer or assign this Privacy Policy and any Personally Identifiable Information to a third party entity that acquires or is merged with Totango as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control (“Change of Control”).

        <p>8. Security. The security of Personally Identifiable Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize sensitive data (such as your credit card information) . However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
