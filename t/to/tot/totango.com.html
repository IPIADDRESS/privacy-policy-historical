      <div class="post">
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices that Totango Ltd. ("Totango") employs in providing the Totango Service (the "Service") to our customers, including their personnel ("Customer(s)").  It explains what data we collect, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), about (i) our Customers; and (ii) the customers and clients of our Customers ("End Clients"), and how we collect, use and retain such data.</p>
		<p>
		1.	Introduction.  We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information that is shared with us as part of the Service.  As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.</p>
		<p>
		2.	The Totango Service and Receipt and Collection of Data.  We provide the Service in order to track an End Client's activities on a Customer's web service and/or other software services offering ("Customer Service") and to provide the Customer with a global view of those activities.
		As the provider of the Service, we receive and/or collect data, including Personally Identifiable Information, in the following ways:</p>
		<p>
		2.1	Customer Information and Account Information.  As part of the Service, we may collect or obtain information, including Personally Identifiable Information, regarding a Customer's use of the Service as well as information that a Customer provides about itself, such as the Customer's account name and email address and related information about its personnel. </p>
		<p>
		2.2	Transactions.  We may collect or obtain information, including Personally Identifiable Information, from each Customer in order to complete the Customer's subscription to the Service.  Such information could include a credit card number, related account and billing information, and other data required to process the order.  We may update such data should a Customer grant us permission to bill a credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments.  We may use the tools, software or services of third party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case the terms of use and/or privacy policy of said third party service provider shall also apply to the transaction.</p>
		<p>
		2.3	End Client Data.  As part of the Service, we may collect or a Customer may provide us with data, including Personally Identifiable Information, about an End Client in connection with the End Client's use of the Customer Service.</p>
		<p>
		2.4	Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.  The Service utilizes "cookies" and other tracking technologies.  A "cookie" is a small text file that we may use to collect and send information about (i) a Customer's Service activity; and (ii) an End Client's use of a Customer Service.  For example, such information may include the IP address from which End Clients access a Customer Service, the date and time of access, the pages visited, and other statistics.  Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personally Identifiable Information previously obtained from a Customer or an End Client.  Our cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a Customer's or an End Client's hard drive or (except with respect to an IP address) to personally identify a Customer or an End Client.  Each Customer and End Client may block incoming cookies or delete existing cookies by adjusting the appropriate setting on its own browser.</p>
		<p>
		3.	The Way We Use Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
		<p>
		3.1	We will use the Personally Identifiable Information of a Customer to provide and improve our Service to the Customer, to contact the Customer, and to identify and authenticate the Customer's access to the services that the Customer is authorized to access.</p>
		<p>
		3.2	We will use the Personally Identifiable Information of an End Client in order to provide the Service to the Customer related to that End Client in connection with the End Client's use of the Customer Service, and may disclose that End Client's Personally Identifiable Information to that Customer.  </p>
		<p>
		3.3	We may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to our third party service and hosting providers, and/or our affiliated companies in order for them to perform business functions or services for us or on our behalf.  Such information may be transferred to other countries around the world.  We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>
		3.4	We reserve the right to retain any Personally Identifiable Information and other Service-related data for such time as we are providing the Service to the Customer to which the information relates and for a reasonable time thereafter.</p>
		<p>
		3.5	Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information or any information that we receive in connection with the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Totango, our Customers, End Clients, or the public. </p>
		<p>
		4.	Anonymous Information.  We may use Anonymous Information (defined below) or disclose it to third party service providers, to provide, improve and develop the Service.  "Anonymous Information" means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information, about the use of the Service.</p>
		<p>
		5.	Children's Privacy.  The Service is not structured to attract children under the age of 18.  Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personally Identifiable Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age. </p>
		<p>
		6.	In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Change of Control.  We may transfer or assign this Privacy Policy and any Personally Identifiable Information to a third party entity that acquires or is merged with Totango as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>
		<p>
		7.	Security.  The security of Personally Identifiable Information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  If requested by a Customer, certain data may be encrypted during transmission.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
		<p>
		8.	Modification.  We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time.  Such change will become effective thirty (30) days following notification to our Customers by email or by posting an updated version on our website www.totango.com and shall not affect Personally Identifiable Information collected prior to the date when the change becomes effective.</p>
		<p>
		9.	Contacting Us.  Any comments, concerns, complaints, or questions regarding our Privacy Policy may be addressed to: privacy@totango.com.  </p>
