				<p>totaltravel.com understands that interacting with websites involves a great deal of trust on your part. We respect your trust in us and we are committed to ensuring the security and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information you provide us. </p>
				<p>By visiting totaltravel.com, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Statement. </p>
				<h2>What Information do we collect and how do we collect it?</h2>
				<p>totaltravel.com collects personally identifiable information about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide. The information we collect from you allows us to personalise and improve the totaltravel.com experience. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display personalization content, customer reviews and recommend services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our site, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf. </p>
				<h2>Information provided by you:</h2>
				<p>We will only collect personally identifiable information that you choose to provide. You can choose not to provide certain information. Where possible, we will enable you to select how we will use this information (for example, by choosing to opt-in or opt-out of receiving special promotional offers).</p>
				<p>You may choose to provide us with personally identifiable information if, for example, you: contact us with an enquiry; register on the site, fill out a survey or other form with your personally identifiable information included; request us to provide you with information; enter a competition; post information to public areas of the site or participate in a promotion.</p>
				<p>By providing any personally identifiable information to us, you fully understand and clearly consent to the transfer of such personally identifiable information to, and the collection and processing of such information in, other countries or territories. Any such transfer and processing by us will be in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
				<h2>Automatically received information</h2>
				<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's Internet Protocol ('IP'). When a visitor requests a page from any Web Site within our network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and for security purposes and to investigate misuse of the network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. </p>
				<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use 'cookies' and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses totaltravel.com. By recognising you, we can provide you with a personalized experience. </p>
				<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
				<p>From time to time, we may send a cookie to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.

This information must be shared with our affiliates and travel suppliers to confirm your reservation and travel preferences.</p>

In the circumstances, we would recommend you study the privacy statements of any affiliate or travel supplier with whom you have made reservations through totaltravel.com. Please note, you may be contacted directly by such suppliers to confirm your reservation. </p>
				<p>Although such third party providers may have access to your personally identifiable information for the purposes set out above, they may not use that personally identifiable information for any other purpose and are required to process your information in accordance with Data Protection Legislation.</p>

				<p>Your credit card or billing account details are only retained for the purpose of handling that individual transaction. We will only retain this information if you have agreed for us store this information for future transactions you may make through totaltravel.com. </p>
				<h3>Promotions, marketing, e-newsletters</h3>
