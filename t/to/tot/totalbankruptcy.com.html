      <h2>Privacy Policy </h2>
<h3>Last Updated: March 2005</h3>
      <p>TotalBankruptcy.com is committed to safeguarding the privacy of everyone 
        who uses this website. Accordingly, we have developed this privacy policy 
        to explain to you what information we collect about you, the steps we 
        take to keep this information private and secure, and what we do with 
        this information. This privacy statement is part of our Terms and Conditions, 
        which can be viewed in full by <a href="terms_conditions.asp">clicking 
        here</a>. By visiting this website, you agree to be bound by the terms 
        of this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please 
        do not use this website.</p>
      <h3>What types of information about you do we collect through this website?</h3><p>We collect personal information about you (and certain of your family 
        members) in three principal ways: (1) information you provide us through 
        this website; (2) information that is automatically generated when you 
        use our website; and (3) information we obtain from third parties.</p>
      <p>With respect to information you provide us on this website, we collect 
        the following information from you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, residence and email addresses, and telephone numbers</li>
        <li>Similar information for your spouse and/or dependents</li>
        <li>Information regarding your assets, debts, income, and expenses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also collect certain information about you automatically when you 
        visit our website. Through our use of "cookies" (cookies are 
        electronic identifiers that are transferred automatically to your computer 
        through your browser and they allow our computers to save certain information 
        you provide us and store information about you so we can recognize you 
        when you visit our website in the future). Other types of information 
        we collect automatically include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (which 
        allows us to understand how you use our site and to enable us to make 
        changes to our site in order to improve your user experience); information 
        regarding your computer and your connection to our site (such as your 
        browser type, operating system, and platform); and your user history to, 
        through, and away from our site, including your session information, page 
        loading times, page errors and broken links, the length of your visits 
        to specific pages within our site, and other information related to your 
        experience on our site. </p>
      <p>From time to time, we collect information about you from third parties, 
        such as updated contact information, and search term and search result 
        information from your web searches.</p>
      <h3>How do you use my personal information?</h3><p>All of the information we obtain about you is stored securely on our 
        website, and we use it only to evaluate your situation and provide legal 
        services to you, to allow unaffiliated sponsoring lawyers or law firms 
        to evaluate your case and provide legal services to you, and to provide 
        ongoing communications to you in furtherance of these legal services. 
        We do not sell or share your personal information with anyone other than 
        our own internal personnel and the unaffiliated sponsoring lawyers and 
        law firms, and certain authorized third parties (such as expert witnesses) 
        who may be retained to assist in your bankruptcy case. As part of this 
        process, those third parties agree to keep your information confidential 
        and agree not to share it with any third party without your express permission. 
      </p>
      <p>We only disclose any personally identifiable information about individual 
        users in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, 
        or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
        with applicable laws, valid legal process, a court order, a current judicial 
        proceeding, or to protect our rights or property. </p>
      <p>We disclose personally identifiable individual information and the other 
        information you provide us to unaffiliated sponsoring lawyers or law firms 
        in order for them to contact you and to determine whether to handle your 
        case. As part of this process, those lawyers or law firm agrees to keep 
        your information confidential and agree not to share it with any third 
        party without your express permission. </p>
      <p>We may also provide aggregate statistical information (such as the city 
        or state you live in) to third parties to describe our services to prospective 
        partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 
        We will not, however, disclose any personally identifiable information 
        about to these parties.</p>
      <p>        <b>How do you protect my personal information?<br>
        </b>Please understand that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
          information online (such as through an email message or through filling 
          out an online form), this information cannot be made 100 percent secure 
          and, in some cases, that information can be intercepted, collected and 
          used by others. However, we work hard to protect your information at all 
          times, and we protect you information in several ways. We store your information 
          on a secure server that only TotalBankruptcy.com and its authorized personnel 
          can access through a password. Additionally, we encrypt your information 
          to prevent third parties without authorization from intercepting your 
      information when it is in transit to us.</p>
