      <h3>How do you use my personal information?</h3><p>All of the information we obtain about you is stored securely on our 
        website, and we use it only to evaluate your situation and provide legal 
        services to you, to allow unaffiliated sponsoring lawyers or law firms

        and agree not to share it with any third party without your express permission. 
      </p>
      <p>We only disclose any personally identifiable information about individual 
        users in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, 
        or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
        with applicable laws, valid legal process, a court order, a current judicial 
        proceeding, or to protect our rights or property. </p>
      <p>We disclose personally identifiable individual information and the other

      <p>We may also provide aggregate statistical information (such as the city 
        or state you live in) to third parties to describe our services to prospective 
        partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 
        We will not, however, disclose any personally identifiable information 
        about to these parties.</p>
      <p>        <b>How do you protect my personal information?<br>
        </b>Please understand that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
          information online (such as through an email message or through filling 
          out an online form), this information cannot be made 100 percent secure 
          and, in some cases, that information can be intercepted, collected and 
          used by others. However, we work hard to protect your information at all 
          times, and we protect you information in several ways. We store your information 
          on a secure server that only TotalBankruptcy.com and its authorized personnel 
          can access through a password. Additionally, we encrypt your information 
          to prevent third parties without authorization from intercepting your 
      information when it is in transit to us.</p>
