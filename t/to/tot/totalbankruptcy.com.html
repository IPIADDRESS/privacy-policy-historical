      </p>
      <p><b>How do you use my personal information?<br>
        </b>All of the information we obtain about you is stored securely on our 
        website, and we use it only to evaluate your situation, to allow unaffiliated 
        sponsoring lawyers or law firms to evaluate your case and provide legal 
        services to you, and to provide ongoing communications to you in furtherance 
        of these legal services. We, or various sponsoring and/or non-sponsoring 
        lawyers and law firms, may also contact you from time to time regarding 
        services which we believe may be of interest to you. You are always free 
        to opt out of these additional communications by sending an e-mail to 
        <a href="mailto:info@totalbankruptcy.com">info@totalbankruptcy.com</a>. 
        We do not sell or share your personal information with anyone other than 
        our own internal personnel and the unaffiliated sponsoring and non-sponsoring 
        lawyers and law firms, and certain authorized third parties (such as expert 
        witnesses) who may be retained to assist in your bankruptcy case. As part 
        of this process, those third parties agree to keep your information confidential 
        and agree not to share it with any third party without your express permission. 
      </p>
      <p>We only disclose any personally identifiable information about individual 
        users in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, 
        or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
        with applicable laws, valid legal process, a court order, a current judicial 
        proceeding, or to protect our rights or property. </p>
      <p>We disclose personally identifiable individual information and the other 
        information you provide us to unaffiliated sponsoring and non-sponsoring 
        lawyers or law firms in order for them to contact you and to determine 
        whether to handle your case. As part of this process, those lawyers or 
        law firm agrees to keep your information confidential and agree not to 
        share it with any third party without your express permission. </p>
      <p>We may also provide aggregate statistical information (such as the city 
        or state you live in) to third parties to describe our services to prospective 
        partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 
        We will not, however, disclose any personally identifiable information 
        about to these parties.<br>
      </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>How do you protect my personal information?<br>
        </b>Please understand that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
        information online (such as through an email message or through filling 
        out an online form), this information cannot be made 100 percent secure 
        and, in some cases, that information can be intercepted, collected and 
        used by others. However, we work hard to protect your information at all 
        times, and we protect you information in several ways. We store your information 
        on a secure server that only TotalBankruptcy.com and its authorized personnel 
        can access through a password. Additionally, we encrypt your information 
        to prevent third parties without authorization from intercepting your 
        information when it is in transit to us.</p>
