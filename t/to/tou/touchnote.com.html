Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By visiting the Platform you accept and consent to the practices described in this policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulations (the “Regulations”), the data controller is Touchnote Limited of&nbsp;Ground &amp; Basement Floors, 17-18 Clere Street, Old Street, London EC2A 4LJ. We may from time to time use data processors, who are not employees, agents or otherwise connected with us, with whom we have an agreement to process your data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will collect and process the following data about you:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information you give us. This is information about you that you give us by filling in forms on our Platform or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. It includes information you provide when you register to use our Platform, or use our Services, place an order on our Platform, enter a competition, promotion or survey on the Platform and when you report a problem with our Platform. The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial and credit card information. In order to take advantage of some of our Services, you may need to supply us with the personal details of a third party (for example, their name and address if you wish to send them some of our products). We will not use this information for anything other than providing the Service for which the information was supplied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information we collect about you. With regard to each of your visits to our Platform we will automatically collect the following information:</span></p>

This can be stored in both video and word form and may allow us to access session videos designed to better illustrate how users interact with the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected Non- Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Service.

We work with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers) and may receive some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else. For example, we may collect anonymous aggregated information about how users use our services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not knowingly solicit or collect any information about users who may be under the age of 16, and will delete any information provided by such individuals as soon as possible.

<h3><strong>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) but may include storage in the cloud outside of the EEA. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing, including such transfer storing or processing in any cloud service. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. You further specfically consent to our sending your information outside the EEA to countries including but not limited to the Phillipines, Jamaica and Kenya for the servicing of your Customer Support Request,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers in the Republic of Ireland. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

However, during the time you may contact us to request that we delete personal data we hold about you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>COOKIES AND LOCAL STORAGE</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you access or use the Service, we may use industry-wide technologies such as “cookies” or similar technologies, which stores certain information on your computer (“Local Storage”) and which will allow us to enable automatic activation of certain features, and make your Service experience much more convenient and effortless. The cookies used by the Service are created per session and does not include any information about you, other than your session key (usually removed as your session ends but sometimes can be kept in your device for no more than 6 months) and the ability to login again quickly. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer’s hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies your online experience with the Service may be limited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Cookies and other technologies on the basis that they are necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TouchNote uses secured Cookies. That means a cookie with a secured flag which can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection. This makes the cookie less likely to be exposed to cookie theft via eavesdropping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the following types of Cookies:</span></p>
<p><b>Strictly necessary cookies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Site and under our terms with you. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Service.</span></p>
<p><b>Analytical/performance cookies. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Site when they are using it. This helps us for our legitimate interests of improving the way our Service works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</span></p>
<p><b>Functionality cookies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These are used to recognise you when you return to our Site. This enables us, subject to your choices and preferences, to personalise our content, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</span></p>
<p><b>Disabling cookies</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect of disabling cookies depends on which cookies you disable but, in general, the Service may not operate properly if cookies are switched off. If you only disable third party cookies, you will not be prevented from making purchases on our sites. If you disable all cookies, you will be unable to use our Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to disable cookies on our site, you need to change your browser settings to reject cookies. How you can do this will depend on the browser you use. Further details on how to disable cookies can be found here:</span></p>
