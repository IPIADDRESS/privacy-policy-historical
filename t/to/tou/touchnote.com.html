<h1>Privacy policy</h1>


<ul>
<li> 
At Touchnote, we believe that you (as our valued customer) have a fundamental right to privacy and to control your personal information. We are grateful that you have chosen to be our customer and we take the responsibility of not only printing and posting your cards, but also of being guardians of the personal information that you give us, extremely seriously.&nbsp; Consequently, we will never pass on your personal details (selling, renting or otherwise) to anyone else without your explicit consent.&nbsp; The following legal document will dictate how we will handle this information.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> 
This privacy policy together with our terms of use sets out how Touchnote Limited, ("we", "our", "us") will use any personal data we collect from you, or you provide to us during your use of the online service (the "website").</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> 
For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controllers are Touchnote Limited of Mercury House, Heather Park Way, Wembley, Middlesex, HA0 1SX. We may from time to time use data processors, who are not employees, agents or otherwise connected with us, with whom we have an agreement to process your data ("Data Processors").</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li> 
We respect the privacy of every individual who visits the website. Our policy on the collection and use of personal information is outlined below.</li>
</ul>

      <li>Anticipate and resolve problems with your service. </li>
      <li>Carry out market research and the tracking of sales. </li>
      <li>Create and inform you of products and services provided either by us or by carefully selected third parties that you may be interested in, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes and allow Data Processors to do the same. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to carry out the above, we may need to collect and process personal information about you (including but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, details of your visits to the website and any transactional information in relation to order fulfilment). We may ask you for this information on the website during the purchase process or at any subsequent point. The data we collect may be provided to Data Processors for analysis so that we may tailor the goods, services and marketing materials we, and other third parties, offer to you (where you have consented to receive the same).</li>
</ul>


    <ul>
      <li>In order to take advantage of some of our services, you may need to supply us with the personal details of a third party (for example, their name and address if you wish to send them some of Touchnote"s products ("the product")) via the website. We will not use this information for anything other than providing the service for which the information was supplied. </li>
    </ul>

  <ul>
      <li>We will not disclose any personally identifiable information without your permission unless: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>We are legally entitled to do so (for example, pursuant to a court order or for the purposes of prevention of crime or fraud). You will be treated as having given your permission for disclosures referred to in this policy. </li>
