This information generally includes the individual or contact name, company name, phone number, email address and other contact information, as well as data about products or services requested and payment information, such as credit card number, expiration date and billing address.
      </li>

    </p>
    <p>

      What About Third Party Websites?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This website may contain links to external websites operated by third parties and our products and services may be integrated with third party products. Please be aware that these third-party websites and products are governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such websites and products. An example of an integrated use is accessing our products and services through Gmail. Those customers will be subject to our privacy policy, as well as Gmail's privacy policy. We encourage you to read the policies of such third parties.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you interact with our website, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We may use or engage others to use cookies and clear gifs to track user activity and collect website information. In addition, we may combine the website information we collect with the other data we collect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies: When you come to our website or use our products and services, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. In addition, we may permit certain third parties to place cookies through our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website or by using our products and services, other than by linking persistent cookies to our current customers as defined below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Session Cookies.</b> Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to our website or using our products and services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests, and to verify your identity, after you have logged in.
      </li>
      <li><b>Persistent cookies.</b> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies that only we, or our service providers, can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our customer or prior visitor to our website. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
      </li>
      <li><b>Third Party Cookies.</b> We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable website information. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of our website, products and services, and to analyze applicable usage levels. We do not share this data with other third parties, except as described above in the section "How Do We Use Information We Collect." You should note, however, that we do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this privacy policy cover such third parties' use of data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Disabling Cookies: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Website visitors who disable their web browser's ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our website; however, you must enable cookies in order to use our products and services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs): We or the third parties we engage to track and analyze website information may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on our website and within our products and services. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users of the web. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails. They let us know which emails have been opened by recipients, allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt out of emails from Tout, please notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@toutapp.com">privacy@toutapp.com</a>.
