<b>B. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</b>
</p>
<h2>How Your Personal Information Is Used</h2>
<p>
We collect your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.  We may use your e-mail address to send a confirmation e-mail and, if necessary, may use other information you provide to us to contact you to assist us in processing purchases and services you select.  If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, your information may be made available to other registered users.  Unless you opt-out, your personal information also may be used to keep you informed about our new products, product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of selected third parties.
</p>
<p>
We may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily.  This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. We may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
</p>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>
<p>
Although we will always strive to guard your identity, we may disclose your personally identifiable information without your permission in limited circumstances.  We will only do so if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with laws, regulations, or government requests or (2) to investigate or protect against harmful activities to our guests, visitors, associates, or property (including the Website), or to others.  If we are required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide your personally identifiable information, we will only do so upon receipt of appropriate documentation.  We may also disclose your information to investigate violation of and enforce our Terms of Use.  Please know that we do not take this responsibility lightly.  Your privacy is of paramount importance to us.
</p>
<h2>Choices Available to You </h2>
<p>
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Website.  However, as previously discussed, withholding certain requested information may prevent us from providing you with certain services.
</p>

You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from GamesPub or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you wish to opt out, you can do so by editing your account preferences with respect to e-mail or the sharing of information or contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@toomkygames.com">privacy@toomkygames.com</a>.

<p>
We may send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent “service alert” messages to you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use a service you have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.  Also, we may contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements. 
</p>
<p>
We retain these rights because in limited cases we may need to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. 
</p>
<p>
If you create a personal account with us, based on your personal preferences we may periodically contact you via e-mail to provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.  These communications will relate to select, reputable third parties with whom we have a strategic marketing relationship.  We may use a third party e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send GamesPub related e-mail.  If you do not wish to receive e-mails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to: <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@toomkygames.com">unsubscribe@toomkygames.com</a>.  In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.  
</p>
<p>

Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites.

These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information. The use of a web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website.  We use the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website’s visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. We may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available.
