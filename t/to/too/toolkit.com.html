			  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR   PRIVACY</h1>
			  <p>This site is owned and operated by Wolters Kluwer.   Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We   want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</p>
			  <p>Because we gather certain types of information   about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms   and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy   statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
			  <h3>Gathered and Tracked Information </h3>
			  <p>We gather two types of information about   users:</p>
			  <ul>
                <li>Information that users provide through optional,   voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic   newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend,   and from participation in polls and surveys.<br>
                    <br>
                </li>
			    <li>Information gathered through aggregated   tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites.   This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to   help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our   audience. Because this site derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and   advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping   our service free to users. </li>
	          </ul>
			  <h3>Electronic newsletters policy   </h3>
			  <p>We offer a free electronic newsletter to   users that choose to subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the   link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription   management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of   registration.</p>
			  <h3> Message boards/forums policy</h3>
			  <p>Users of the site's Discussion Boards  must   register  (free of charge) in order to   post messages. During   registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email   address.</p>
			  <h3>"E-mail this to a friend" policy</h3>
			  <p>Our site users can choose to electronically   forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a   friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the   recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and,   of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not   used for any other purpose.</p>
			  <h3>Polling</h3>
			  <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they   can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience   thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are   aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. The site may use a   system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a   particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about   individual users.</p>
			  <h3>Surveys</h3>
			  <p>The site  may occasionally conduct user surveys to   better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated   demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and   partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with   any third party.</p>
			  <h3>Children</h3>
			  <p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online   Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request   personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without   requesting parental consent.</p>
			  <h3>User tracking</h3>
			  <p>The site  tracks user traffic patterns throughout   all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about   individual users. The site does break down overall usage statistics according to   a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information   from the browser string (information contained in every user's   browser).</p>
			  <p>The site sometimes tracks and catalogs the search   terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never   associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which   areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We   do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs   overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
			  <h3>Cookies</h3>
			  <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the   browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal   Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to   information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only   personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A   cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other   sites. The uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described   above). </p>
			  <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your   browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you   will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have   cookies turned on to use this site. However, you may need cookies to participate   actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.</p>
			  <h3>USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
			  <p>The site  uses any information voluntarily given   by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to   provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare   future content based on the interests of our users.</p>
			  <p>As stated above, we use information that users   voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable   users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out   newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter),   and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be   particularly interested in something we are doing. </p>
			  <p>When we use tracking information to determine   which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those   areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page   performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We   track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what   interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user   enters.</p>
			  <p>We  create aggregate reports on user   demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This   allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to   receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track   the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know   that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information   about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal   process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
			  <h3>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</h3>
			  <p>We  use the above-described information to   tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand   our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We   will not share information about individual users with any third party, except   to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal   safety of our users or the public.</p>
			  <h3>OPT-OUT POLICY</h3>
			  <p>We give users options wherever necessary and   practical. Such choices include:</p>
			  <ul>
                <li><strong>Opting not to register to receive our   electronic newsletters.<br>
                      <br>
                </strong> </li>
			    <li><strong>Opting not to participate in certain   interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally   identifiable information from our users </strong></li>
		      </ul>
			  <h3>CONSENT</h3>
			  <p>By using this site, you consent to the collection   and use of this information. If we decide to change our privacy   policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of   what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we   disclose it.</p>
