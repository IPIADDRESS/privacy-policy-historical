  <div class="content">
    <p>Thank you for visiting <a href="http://www.toonix.com" title="www.toonix.com" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://www.toonix.com/_2&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">www.toonix.com</a> (“Toonix”) a site operated by Turner Broadcasting System Europe Limited (“Turner”, “we” or “us). This Privacy Policy explains how Turner, uses information it collects about you and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, any reference to “parent” shall include legal guardian.<br>
</p>
<p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>The type and amount of information we collect depends on the information that you provide when you contact us via e-mail and /or when you register to play Toonix.<br>
In order to play Toonix and access all the features of the game, you need to register. If you are under sixteen (“child”) and wish to register, we will ask for your parent’s e-mail address so that we can obtain your parent’s permission to process your personal information. We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from anyone under sixteen without notifying their parents via e-mail and giving parents the option to consent to their child’s details being included in the applicable database. If you are older than sixteen you can provide your own email address and activate the account yourself.</p>
<p>To register with Toonix, a child will need to provide a username, a password and a parental email address. We will keep this information on a temporary basis until we receive the child’s parent’s consent to the child becoming a fully active user of Toonix. During the period when parental consent is being requested the child account will be held in our database as a temporary user. If we do not receive the child’s parent’s consent we will delete the information provided by the child within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, and the child’s account will be closed down. </p>
<p>In order to register a child as a Toonix user, the child’s parent will need to provide, the child’s name, surname, gender and date of birth. The child’s parent may also provide the child’s email address if the parent has agreed to the child receiving Toonix newsletters.<br>
<br>
USE OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>Any information submitted will be used as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
We use the information collected to provide our services, respond to any queries, and ensure that we request and receive the correct consent from a child’s parents.<br>
We use the parent’s email address provided at registration to send the parent a message that can be used to activate the child’s Toonix account. In that initial message, parents are provided a link to this Privacy Policy and details about how their children can use Toonix, including the Terms of Use. Parents are required to provide their consent before their children's accounts can be activated. Parents’ email addresses are also used to communicate with parents about their children in relation to their activity at Toonix such as a forgotten password. </p>
<p>Upon activation of the Toonix account, the child’s details will be used to administer the account. The child email address, if provided, and with parent’s prior approval, will only be used to send him or her our Toonix newsletter. Toonix users will be identified only by their screen name and Toonix avatar. Date of birth, gender, name, surname and email address, if provided, will not be visible to other users. However, if a child invites a friend to join the Toonix world, his first name will be visible to the friend.</p>
<p>It is also possible for two or more registered users to become online "friends" and send each other pre-defined messages, send virtual gifts and visit each other’s worlds and virtual rooms. We only allow limited interaction and users’ personal details will not be accessible.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about how Toonix operates, we encourage you to read our <a href="/parents-page" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;https://web.archive.org/parents-page_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">Parents information</a> page.</p>
<p>If the child no longer wishes to receive Toonix newsletter, he or she may opt-out of receiving them by clicking “unsubscribe” included in each newsletter.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>We may share information about visitors to this site in aggregate with third parties including advertisers, business partners, and sponsors, to understand user trends and patterns and manage and improve our business relationships. Please be assured that such information will be anonymised so that identity is protected.</p>
<p>We may share personal information with third parties to administer and process user requests. We may also share personal information with third parties (such as auditors or legal advisors) to obtain professional advice.

<br>
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
<p>Toonix may contain links to other sites where information practices may be different to ours. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off Toonix. This includes links from advertisers, channel sponsors and partners that may use our logos as part of a co-branding agreement.

<p>We sometimes offer content (e.g., competitions, virtual goods and shops) that is sponsored by or co branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information. We are not responsible for and have no control over these third parties' use of this information. .<br>
<br>
CONTACT AND NOTICES </p>

<p>A user account can be deleted using one of the following procedures: (i) a parent can select the “Close My Account” link within the activation email; or (ii) the child may select the “Close my Account” link within the Toonix website. </p>
<p>If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. We will not use or disclose personal information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without informing you and providing you with an opportunity to opt-out of these unrelated uses.</p>

PARENTAL GUIDANCE</p>
<p>It is important to us that children can enjoy Toonix in a responsible fashion. We, therefore, encourage children to consult with their parents before providing personal information. We also encourage parents to supervise their children's online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. </p>
