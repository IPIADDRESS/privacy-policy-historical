      <p>Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered through this Web site and, where applicable, through our Support Forum and Web-shop in connection with this Web site or support for products you have purchased, and do not necessarily reflect our practices with respect to information gathered through other Web sites that we operate or through other off-line means.</p>

      <p><strong><u>What Information About Me Is Collected?</u></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Information You Voluntarily Provide</strong><br>
      We collect and store information that you enter into this Web site and Web-shop or that you provide to our Support Forum.  For example, information will be collected when you open an account, when you register and/or authorize a product, when you place an order, when you sign up to receive emails or other promotional communications, when you contact us with online enquiries and/or when you otherwise voluntarily submit or provide information to us.  The information we collect that you provide to us may include, but is not limited to: names, billing addresses, shipping addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, passwords, credit card numbers and expiration dates, serial numbers of purchased products, identification number(s) used to identify certain hardware in your computer(s), any arbitrary identifying name or number you provide of the computers on which products are installed, information regarding orders, demographic information and information regarding interests and preferences.  This information is used to complete transactions and provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, and for administrative and analytical purposes.  This information also may be used to contact you about sales, product updates, product recommendations and special offers, <u>unless you have opted not to receive communications</u> in connection with this Web site. </p>
      <p><strong>Information We Automatically Collect</strong><br>
      Like many Web sites, we use technologies to collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with this Web site.  For example, we may collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name when you visit this Web site.  We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage.  This information is used to analyze and improve this Web site and to provide our customers with a fulfilling experience.</p>
      <p>Also, like many Web sites, we use “cookies”, which are files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser.  Cookies help us to identify account holders and to optimize their log-in, account management and shopping experience.  Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this Web site without checking out.  Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them.  We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so that we can offer you a better experience on this Web site.</p>
      <p>We may from time to time also use pixels, transparent GIF files, Flash movies or other visual surfaces to help manage online advertising.  These files enable our ad management partner(s) to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.  The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with our ad management partner(s). With cookies, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.  It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>
      <p><strong>Other Information</strong><br>
        We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, such as a postal service providing notices of change of addresses and providers of consumer data, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations, updates and special offers that we think will interest you.<br>
      </p>
