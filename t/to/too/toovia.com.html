When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other TOOVIA settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit TOOVIA.</li>        </ul>        <p class="header"> Log file information:</p>        <ul>            <li> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e.: visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</li>            <li> In using our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.

A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by TOOVIA.</li>            <li> A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>        </ul>        <p class="header"> Metadata:</p>        <ul>            <li> Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</li>            <li> Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g.: to mark keywords when you post a photo or check-in), geotag (e.g.: to mark your location to a photo or check-in), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs, then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g.: through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</li>        </ul>        </div>        <div class="section row-fluid">        <blockquote><p> 2.
