<main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"><p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of toolsofmen.com ”we” or “us”). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the toolsofmen.com website (the “Site”), and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).</p><p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we’ll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</p><p>toolsofmen.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. “Period.”</p><h2>How we Collect and Use Email Addresses and Other Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>Like many websites, toolsofmen.com offers users the ability to sign up for an email newsletter. Your email is held within a trusted email service provider (Aweber Inc. and Campaign Monitor). You can unsubscribe from email communications at any time using the email service provider’s “unsubscribe” button. You can also email shawn (at) toolsofmen (dot) com if you’d prefer to be manually removed from the email list.</p><p>We will occasionally email you about consulting service offers, new content and special events happening with the toolsofmen community. Your email is never, rented sold or shared with any 3rd party.</p><p>If you have questions about how we manage your email address and other personally identifiable information, feel free to contact</p><p>shawn (at) toolsofmen (dot) com</p><h2>How we gather information from users</h2><p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in surveys, sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, toolsofmen.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</p><h2>Google Analytics Tracking</h2><p>We’ve implemented a tracking code in order to collect demographic information in Google Anayltics. You can opt-out of this program anytime by adjusting your <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a>. You may also wish to review other <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">available opt-outs</a>.</p><h2>What we do with the information we collect</h2><p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p><p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. Although we use remarketing, we don’t collect or store personally identifiable information, including demographic information. We also don’t send Google any precise information (ie. location) without your consent. In terms of Remarketing, Google reserves the right to display to users which remarketing lists they’re on, along with the corresponding domain name.</p><p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on toolsofmen.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by toolsofmen.com and other topics we think you might find of interest.</p><p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by toolsofmen.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p><h2>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</h2><p>toolsofmen.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.
