<h1>Student Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>In addition to the terms set forth on the Tooling U-SME (the "Company") Privacy Statement which apply to all users of this website (the "Website"), students enrolled in Tooling University courses ("Students") are also subject to the following specific privacy practices. We urge you to read this Student Privacy Statement in its entirety so that you will understand all of the practices and procedures that relate to your online privacy.</p>

<p class="lead">Overview</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement addresses your privacy by:</p>

<ul class="list">
	<li><strong>Informing you about:</strong>

	<ul class="list">
		<li>the type of personal information the Company collects about you through this Website;</li>
		<li>how that information is collected;</li>
		<li>the general purposes for which information is collected;</li>
		<li>what disclosures of information will be made;</li>
		<li>how, and to what extent, you can limit those disclosures; and</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Assuring you that:</strong>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>reasonable precautions are taken to protect your Education Records, including any Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosures, alteration, or destruction;</li>
		<li>Company employees who have access to your Education Records are informed about our privacy procedures for protecting such information;</li>
		<li>reasonable policies and procedures are in place to insure that the Company gathers only the information it needs in order to perform the tasks listed below and that your Education Records are retained only as long as necessary for the purposes for which they were gathered;</li>
		<li>you have reasonable access to any Education Records you provide; and</li>
		<li>there is a procedure for correcting or modifying your Education Records, if appropriate.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Accountability</p>

<p>The Company is responsible for your Education Records under its control. The Company has appointed an officer who is accountable for the Company's compliance with these privacy principles. Chad Schron Howard has been designated the Company's privacy officer in connection with these privacy principles. Chad Schron can be reached by telephone at (866) 706-6600, by e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@toolingu.com">info@toolingu.com</a> or by regular mail to Tooling University, 3615 Superior Avenue East, Building 44, 6th Floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44114. Questions, requests for copies of policies or practices, comments or challenges concerning compliance should be directed to the privacy officer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither Tooling University's computer systems, data storage systems, nor data transmission over the Internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Education Records, and to utilize such methods as are required under applicable law, since no method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of your Education Records.</p>

<p class="lead">Children</p>

<p>Students must be over the age of 18. Additionally, we do not use the Website to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>

<p class="lead">Cookie Disclosure Information</p>

<p>A "cookie" is a persistent, client-side, hypertext transfer protocol file. Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies facilitate web surfing by saving visitor preferences and other information. The rise of cookies is a widespread industry standard and thus many major websites use cookies. Using a cookie allows record-keeping while you are visiting a website and saves you the extra effort of entering certain information multiple times in one site.</p>

<p>Most browsers are initially configured to accept and process cookies. You can configure your browser to refuse cookies. Extensive information concerning cookies is available on the World Wide Web by searching for the word "cookies." If you have any questions concerning our use of cookies, please contact our privacy officer.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to use cookies and related technologies on our Website.</p>

<p class="lead">Internal Use of Education Records</p>

<p>PII as provided on the Create a Student Account page may be combined with other Education Records and used internally by the Company. We will not collect sensitive information (e.g., political or religious beliefs, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health, or medical condition) from Students.</p>

<p>Education Records we collect may be used by the Company for:</p>

<ul class="list">
	<li>monitoring Student's participation and performance in training programs and identifying skill gaps;</li>
	<li>responding to Student inquiries;</li>
	<li>providing general information that may be of interest to Students;</li>
	<li>editorial and feedback purposes;</li>
	<li>monitoring and improving our internal operations;</li>
	<li>customizing content and layout of our site; and</li>
	<li>marketing and promotional purposes as permissible under applicable law.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will protect PII against unauthorized access in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p class="lead">Use and Disclosure of Aggregated, Non-Personally Identifiable Data</p>

<p>Some information about your IP address, web browser, and computer system is automatically transmitted to our web servers as an integral part of the operation of the Internet, and we reserve the right to automatically collect and/or track such information. In addition, information regarding what pages of the Website you access may be combined with data regarding your school or employer and used and disclosed in a non-personally identifiable manner.</p>

<p>Non-personally identifiable data we collect will be aggregated and used for:</p>

<ul class="list">
	<li>monitoring and improving our internal operations;</li>
	<li>producing statistical and/or demographic data for use by advertisers, potential advertisers, and other business partners;</li>
	<li>customizing content and layout of our site; and</li>
	<li>marketing and promotional purposes as permissible under applicable law</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties</p>

<p><u>For all Students:</u> We will not disclose PII if such disclosure is prohibited under applicable law, and we will comply with applicable law in connection with any disclosures that are permitted thereunder.</p>

<p>We may provide Student Directory Information (but not other Educational Records) to marketing partners. In addition, we may share Educational Records with outside service providers. Any third party we share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose data to will be prescreened by us to as part of reasonable efforts to ascertain that they are reputable and that they will use the data only for the processing purposes we request or marketing purposes that we determine you might be interested in and in accordance with applicable law. We will use reasonable efforts to make sure that all such third parties are contractually prohibited from using or disclosing Education Records for any purposes other than for that which they have been engaged and are required to maintain the security of the Education Records provided by the Company, and to process such Education Records only on our instructions, in compliance with this Privacy Statement, and in an appropriate confidential and secure manner.</p>

<p><u>For all Students accessing Tooling University through an employer's account</u>: We may provide administrative reports containing Educational Records to employers providing Tooling University accounts to its employees.</p>

<p><u>For all Students accessing Tooling University through a school account</u>: We may provide administrative reports containing Educational Records to schools providing Tooling University accounts to its students.</p>

<p><u>For Students attending schools receiving funding from the U.S. Department of Education</u> (each, a "School"): We will comply with our privacy obligations, if any, under The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 ("FERPA"). See Section VIII, below.</p>

<p class="lead">FERPA Rights</p>

<p>[Applies only to Students attending eligible Schools]</p>

<p>As a provider of outsourced training services to Schools, the Company is committed to Student rights under FERPA in connection with Education Records.</p>

<p>As such, Company will work with each School to ensure that Students can:</p>

<ul class="list">
	<li>Inspect and review Education Records in Company's possession and under Company's control;</li>
	<li>Request the correction of Education Records in Company's possession and under Company's control which the Student believes are inaccurate or misleading;</li>
	<li>Opt-out of disclosure by Company to third parties of Directory Information by notifying Company in writing; and</li>
	<li>In cases where Education Records include PII (excluding Directory Information), opt-in prior to Company's disclosure of any such information to third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Company will only use Education Records provided by a School for the limited purposes for which the disclosure by the School was made. We reserve the right, for security reasons, to verify your identity before performing your requests.</p>

<p class="lead">Opting Out</p>

<p>You may opt out of having your Directory Information and/or other personally identifiable Education Records shared with third parties by contacting us by e-mail or regular mail. Please note that in order to fulfill certain obligations, we may need to continue providing certain Education Records to your School or employer and sending you notices or other important information concerning your account.</p>

<p class="lead">Special Circumstances</p>

<p>Due to the existing legal, regulatory and security environment, the Company may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose records about Website usage and/or Education Records. We will attempt to limit such disclosure to instances where we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in response to a subpoena or other legal process; where it is reasonably required to do so in order to maintain, update or otherwise implement our data security measures, equipment, technical operations and the like; or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce our rights.</p>

<p class="lead">CONSENT</p>

<p>I understand and agree that Education Records (defined above) about me may be collected, transmitted, stored and used by Tooling University and shared with third parties as set forth above. I understand that the privacy of Education Records and other information collected from me by Tooling University is governed by this Tooling University Student Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>I have read, understand and agree to abide by the Tooling University Student Privacy Statement.</p>
