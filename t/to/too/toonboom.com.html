            <p>Where 
              TOON BOOM considers it appropriate, TOON BOOM uses encryption and/or 
              authentication tools among other methods to protect certain web-based 
              personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure 
              when they are transmitted to us. </p>
            <p>Certain 
              sections of our Web sites allow you to order products and services 
              for which you may be required to provide your credit card information. 
              These sections use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol for browsers 
              that support 128-bit encryption (such as Netscape® Navigator version 
              2.0 or greater, or Microsoft® Internet Explorer version 2.1 or greater). 
              SSL encrypts information as it travels between the customer and 
              TOON BOOM so that your purchase information cannot be read as it 
              travels over the Internet. You will know that your browser is secure 
              by a change in the URL from http:// to https://. If the URL on a 
              page asking you to provide information remains as http://, beware 
              as this may result in an unsecure transmission. If you are not using 
              a browser which adheres to the SSL Protocol and supports 128-bit 
              encryption, the information you provide may not be secure and we 
              recommend that you contact TOON BOOM by telephone to place your 
              order. </p>
            <p>When 
              processing credit card purchases over the Internet, TOON BOOM or 
              our third party service provider will verify your credit card information 
              with the appropriate financial institution prior to processing your 
              purchase. Neither we nor our third party service provider will supply 
              your credit card information to any other third party. </p>
            <p>We 
              instruct our employees with access to your information that it is 
              to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this

            <p>From 
              time to time TOON BOOM may make online surveys available to users 
              of the Site. Participation in those surveys is voluntary. Some online 
              surveys may ask participants for personal information, such as an 
              email address, in addition to requesting answers to survey questions. 
              TOON BOOM may use that personal information to contact the participant 
              if necessary, or to send the participant information about TOON 
              BOOM or other topics TOON BOOM thinks will interest the participant. 
              TOON BOOM may make the results of any survey publicly available, 
              although TOON BOOM will not attribute any particular response to 
              you without your permission. Participants may opt-out of receiving 
              future informational mailings from TOON BOOM. See the section entitled 
              HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION? above. </p>
            <p>On 
              occasion TOON BOOM may make available to users of the Site contests 
              in which they may qualify for participation. Participation is always 
              voluntary and subject to the applicable contest rules. The contest 
              may ask participants to provide personal information as a condition 
              of participation. TOON BOOM may use that information to contact 
              the participant with regard to the contest itself, or when otherwise 
              necessary. TOON BOOM may also use that information to send participants 
              information about TOON BOOM or other topics TOON BOOM thinks will 
              interest the participant. Finally, TOON BOOM may make the names 
              of contest winners public, as provided in the rules of such contests, 
              or as required by applicable law. Participants may opt-out of receiving 
              future mailings from TOON BOOM. See the section entitled HOW DO 
              YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION? above. In some instances, 
              the applicable contest rules may contain additional or different 
              uses for the information you provide; please be sure to review those 
              rules carefully before entering. </p>
