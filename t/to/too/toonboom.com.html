                <p>You can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your e-mail address. In this case, our Web server may collect the name of the IP address you used to access the Internet and the web site you came from and visit next. This information is used by us and our business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to this Site in general. We may also use this data to monitor site performance, for systems administration purposes, to make this Site easier and more convenient to use and to report information in aggregate form to our advisers and other third parties (e.g. how many visitors log in to this Site). </p>
                <p><b>Cookies </b></p>
                <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive, which permits us to recognize you when you access this Site.

This cookie, by itself, doesn't tell us your e-mail address or who you are. If you decide to register on-line with us, we may collect additional information to provide tailored offerings or content to you. In this case, we use cookies to recognize you on subsequent visits and make your on-line experience more convenient, unless prohibited by the law of the jurisdiction where our server is located or which otherwise applies. </p>
                <p>You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. Please note, however, that by not accepting cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide you when you visit this Site. </p>
                <p>Tracking user preferences also helps us serve you targeted advertising. Targeted advertisements are probably more interesting for you and are more productive for our advertisers. Please note that we do not share your personal information with advertisers. </p>

                <p>There are times when we may ask you for or you may choose to provide for information about yourself and your business to assist us in meeting your various needs.

To provide these products or services, we may need to ask you directly to provide, among other things, your name, mailing address, postal code, e-mail address, phone number and date of birth. Also, you may elect to apply on-line for one of our products or services, which may require us and our subcontractors to gather additional information from our affiliates and third parties (including credit information) to determine your eligibility or to fulfill your order. At times, we also conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience of our visitors. You will be given the option of not participating in such surveys. Once you provide us such information about yourself, your browsing on this Site will no longer be anonymous to us. </p>

                <p>Where TOON BOOM considers it appropriate, TOON BOOM uses encryption and/or authentication tools among other methods to protect certain web-based personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us. </p>
                <p>Certain sections of our Web sites allow you to order products and services for which you may be required to provide your credit card information. These sections use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol for browsers that support 128-bit encryption (such as Netscape® Navigator version 2.0 or greater, or Microsoft® Internet Explorer version 2.1 or greater). SSL encrypts information as it travels between the customer and TOON BOOM so that your purchase information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. You will know that your browser is secure by a change in the URL from http:// to https://. If the URL on a page asking you to provide information remains as http://, beware as this may result in an unsecure transmission. If you are not using a browser which adheres to the SSL Protocol and supports 128-bit encryption, the information you provide may not be secure and we recommend that you contact TOON BOOM by telephone to place your order. </p>
                <p>When processing credit card purchases over the Internet, TOON BOOM or our third party service provider will verify your credit card information with the appropriate financial institution prior to processing your purchase. Neither we nor our third party service provider will supply your credit card information to any other third party. </p>
                <p>We instruct our employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. Employees who misuse customer information may be subject to disciplinary action. </p></td>
