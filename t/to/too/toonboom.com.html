                <p>Where TOON BOOM considers it appropriate, TOON BOOM uses encryption and/or authentication tools among other methods to protect certain web-based personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us. </p>
                <p>Certain sections of our Web sites allow you to order products and services for which you may be required to provide your credit card information. These sections use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol for browsers that support 128-bit encryption (such as Netscape® Navigator version 2.0 or greater, or Microsoft® Internet Explorer version 2.1 or greater). SSL encrypts information as it travels between the customer and TOON BOOM so that your purchase information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. You will know that your browser is secure by a change in the URL from http:// to https://. If the URL on a page asking you to provide information remains as http://, beware as this may result in an unsecure transmission. If you are not using a browser which adheres to the SSL Protocol and supports 128-bit encryption, the information you provide may not be secure and we recommend that you contact TOON BOOM by telephone to place your order. </p>
                <p>When processing credit card purchases over the Internet, TOON BOOM or our third party service provider will verify your credit card information with the appropriate financial institution prior to processing your purchase. Neither we nor our third party service provider will supply your credit card information to any other third party. </p>
                <p>We instruct our employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. Employees who misuse customer information may be subject to disciplinary action. </p></td>
