Inc. (TWS) is committed to protecting the privacy of all TWS Members, as well as all visitors to this Website (the “site”). The following
is the TWS privacy statement outlining our policies governing the collection
and use of personal information, including registered Member information. If you have any questions regarding
this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@togetherweserved.com">info@togetherweserved.com</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><b><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">Information Collection
&amp; Use</span></b><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">TWS requires Members to register for TWS Membership and provide personal information including but not limited to the Member's name, postal address, phone number and email address. TWS does not collect such information from others.  TWS uses this information to establish and deliver the benefits of Membership and to communicate with the Member about new offerings or potential Member benefits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">The collection and use of personal data (along with other kinds of data) is critical to the successful operation of TWS. We collect and use personal data from or about you to support and serve our membership, including to:
</span></p>

<ul style="font-size:7.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana; line-height:150%">
<li>Deliver the information, programs, products and/or services you request;</li>
<li>Evaluate and respond to your inquiries and submissions;</li>
<li>Provide you with customer support and Membership benefits;</li>
<li>Communicate with you through various channels, including postal mail, email, telephone, apps, online chats, in person, and social media;</li>
<li>Process your payments and account adjustments;</li>
<li>Create and manage your Membership registration;</li>
<li>Customize your experiences and identify you online, including by displaying offers and advertising tailored to your interests;</li>
<li>Evaluate and improve our services, Memberships, benefits, digital services, and other operations (e.g., developing and analyzing new or revised services; performing market research and data analytics; creating and applying data models; and assessing the effectiveness of our websites, apps, communications, advertising, and marketing programs);</li>
<li>Comply with and enforce applicable legal obligations, our policies, and our terms and conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">TWS may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf or as licensed or formally arranged service providers, and will need to share personal information with these agents to establish and deliver services, information, and other benefits of Membership. TWS's agents do not receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks. TWS will not disclose registration information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with TWS, without your consent or as otherwise stated in this privacy policy. If at some point TWS sells all or a portion of its assets, customer information is one of those assets that would be transferred or acquired by a third party; the third party would then have the right to continue using the personal information as set forth in this policy. TWS may release or exchange personal information if required to do so to comply with applicable law or to enforce its rights or agreements or prevent fraud or reduce credit risk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">TWS also collects and analyze information regarding the use of TWS's Memberships and TWS site activity (“personally identifiable information” or “PII”). PII collected may include but is not limited to web site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser and operating system, etc. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, administer the site, and improve the quality and types of Membership delivered. TWS may also collect, track and analyze information that does not personally identify a user in aggregate form. This aggregate data will be used at TWS's discretion and may be shared with third parties.  TWS also occasionally shares personal data with select, unaffiliated organizations for use in their own social or Veterans-related missions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">We may collect personal data about you from unaffiliated sources with whom we contract, such as other service providers and data aggregators, as well as from public sources or databases. We may obtain data such as your name, postal address, telephone number, demographic data (such as age, gender, income level, and purchasing profiles), and&nbsp;publicly observed&nbsp;data (such as activity on blogs, videos, and other online postings). We generally use such data to identify potential members or other individuals we try to reach as part of our services, to update personal data we already have about current Members and other individuals (such as an address update), or to enhance our data models.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">We may also purchase or license personal data lists from unaffiliated sources and provide access to those lists to other entities.&nbsp; Although we may enhance such lists by applying our data models, we do not contribute personal data related to TWS members to such lists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">Registered Members will be using the TWS site to view information supplied by other Members. TWS will not review, share, distribute or reference such information except as may be required in providing the requested TWS Membership service, or as provided in the TWS Terms of Use Agreement, or as may be required by law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">TWS has implemented processes designed to protect PII and Member information and maintain security. Each registered Member is assigned a unique user name and password which is required to access their account and relationship information. It is the Member's responsibility to protect the security of their login information. TWS's servers are located in secure server environments. Firewalls and other advanced security technologies are employed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black">These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website and associated interactions. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites.</span></p>

<li><b>Approved Vendors.</b>&nbsp;We may share personal data with unaffiliated companies or individuals we hire to provide services or perform business functions on our behalf (such as print, mail, or email vendors; web hosting vendors; cloud service providers; consultants; digital advertising and analytics vendors) because these vendors need access to the personal data to perform the functions we’ve requested of them. These vendors are contractually required to treat the personal data we provide as confidential, and to use the personal data only to provide the services we have requested they perform on our behalf.</li><br>
<li><b>Payment Processors.</b>&nbsp;We may share your personal data with banks or other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial&nbsp;services,&nbsp;and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction purposes.</li><br>

<li><b>Social Media Advertising Networks.</b>&nbsp;We may share personal data with social media networks to facilitate their delivery of our customized advertising or messages on their network. The limited personal data we provide as part of the networks’ custom audience programs (generally email addresses) facilitates the delivery of our content to the right social media user.
