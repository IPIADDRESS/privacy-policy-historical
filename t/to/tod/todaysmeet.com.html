    <h2>TodaysMeet Privacy Policy</h2>

  <span class="subtitle">Your privacy is important.</span>

  <p>TodaysMeet tries to collect as little information as
      possible to provide a quality messaging service. Here
      are some guiding principles:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>We don't collect information we don't need. We don't
          care about your gender or income.</li>
      <li>We don't share personal information except to comply
          with the law, develop the service, or protect our
          rights.</li>
      <li>We don't store information on our servers any longer
          than you ask us to.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This Privacy Policy is available under a <strong>Creative Commons
      Sharealike</strong> license. It is based on the Privacy Policy
      from <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Automattic</a>.</p>

  <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

  <p>Like most website operators, TodaysMeet collects
      non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
      web browsers and servers typically make available, such
      as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
      and the date and time of each visitor request. TodaysMeet's
      purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying
      information is to better understand how TodaysMeet's
      visitors use its website. From time to time, TodaysMeet
      may release non-personally-identifying information
      in the aggregate, ie: "30% of our users use Internet
      Explorer".</p>

  <p>TodaysMeet also collects potentially
      personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
      addresses. TodaysMeet does not use such information
      to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose
      such information, other than under the same circumstances
      it uses and discloses personally-identifying information,
      as described below.</p>

  <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

  <p>Certain visitors to TodaysMeet's website choose to
      interact with TodaysMeet in ways that require
      TodaysMeet to gather some personally-identifying and
      potentially personally-identifying information. The
      amount and type of information that TodaysMeet
      gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
      For example, when you post a message in
      a room, we ask for a name. In each case, TodaysMeet
      collects information only insofar as is necessary or
      appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
      interaction with TodaysMeet. TodaysMeet does not
      disclose personally-identifying information other than
      as described below. Visitors can always refuse to
      supply personally-identifying information, with the
      caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
      certain website-related activities.</p>

  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

  <p>TodaysMeet may collect statistics about the
      behavior of visitors to its website. For example,
      TodaysMeet may monitor the most popular public
      rooms. TodaysMeet may display this information
      publicly or provide it to others. However, TodaysMeet
      does not disclose personally-identifying
      information other than as described below.</p>

  <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

  <p>TodaysMeet discloses potentially personally-identifying
      information only to those of its employees, contractors,
      and affilated organizations that (i) need to know that
      information in order to process it on TodaysMeet's
      behalf or to provide services available at TodaysMeet's
      website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
      others. Some of those employees, contractors and
      affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
      home country; by using TodaysMeet's website, you
      consent to the transfer of such information to them.
      TodaysMeet will not rent or sell potentially
      personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than
      to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
      as described above, TodaysMeet discloses potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying
      information only when required to do so by law, or when
      TodaysMeet believes in good faith that disclosure is
      reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
      of TodaysMeet, its owner, third parties, or the
      public at large. If you send TodaysMeet a request (for
      example via a support e-mail or feedback mechanism) we
      reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
      clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
      other users. TodaysMeet takes all reasonable mesaures
      necessary to protect against the unauthorized access,
      use, alteration or destruction of potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying
      information.</p>
