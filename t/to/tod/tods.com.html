<p><strong><a name="article"></a>“<em>Article 7. Right of Access to Personal Data and Other Rights</em></strong><br> <em>1. </em><em>The data subject shall have the right to obtain confirmation as to  whether or not personal information concerning him exists, regardless of their  being already recorded, and communication of such information in intelligible  form.</em><br> <em>2. </em><em>The data subject shall have the right to be informed:</em><br> <em>a) of the source of the personal information;</em><br> <em>b) of the purposes and methods of the processing;</em><br> <em>c) of the logic applied to the processing, if the latter is carried out  with the help of electronic means;</em><br> <em>d) of the identification information concerning the data controller,  data processors and the representative designated as per article 5, paragraph  2;</em><br> <em>e) of the entities or categories of entities to whom or which the  personal information may be communicated and who or which may obtain knowledge  of said information in their capacity as designated representative in the State’s  territory, data processor or person in charge of the processing.</em><br> <em>3. </em><em>The data subject shall have the right to obtain:</em><br> <em>a) updates or rectification of or, where interested therein, additions  to the data;</em><br> <em>b) deletion, anonymisation or blocking of data that has been processed  unlawfully, including data whose retention is unnecessary for the purposes for  which it was collected or subsequently processed;</em><br> <em>c) certification to the effect that the operations as per letters a) and  b) have been notified, as also related to their contents, to the entities to  whom or which the data was communicated or disseminated, unless this  requirement proves impossible or involves a manifestly disproportionate effort  compared with the right that is to be protected.</em><br> <em>4. </em><em>The data subject shall have the right to object, in whole or in part:</em><br> <em>a) on legitimate grounds, to the processing of personal data concerning  him/her, even if it is relevant to the purpose of the collection;</em><br> <em>b) to the processing of personal information concerning him/her, where  it is carried out for the purpose of sending advertising materials or direct  selling or else for the performance of market or commercial communication  surveys.</em></p>

If you claim that your personal information has been used in a manner that is improper and/or contrary to these Terms of Use or that we have otherwise violated your rights or privacy, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to Richard Spata, An. Del. U.S.A., Inc.’s CFO at the following address: r.spata@todsgroup.com. We agree to review and negotiate your claim in good faith. If we reject your claim or if we are unable to negotiate a resolution of your claim with you, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings as provided herein (rather than in any judicial forum or court). Any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to use of your personal information and/or violation of your rights of privacy shall be resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in the city of New York, New York, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award either party any remedy permitted by applicable law.  If you wish to pursue your claim in arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to An. Del. U.S.A., Inc.’s registered agent, Corporation Service Company (at the following address:  80 State Street,  Albany,  NY 12207), in order begin arbitration. <br>
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) shall arbitrate all disputes pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. We each agree that any proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a member in a class, consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the above arbitration agreement will be void as to you.  An. Del. U.S.A., Inc. - a wholly owned subsidiary of TOD’S - complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. An. Del. U.S.A., Inc. has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

U.S.A., Inc.’s certification, please visit  <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a></p></div>            </div>
