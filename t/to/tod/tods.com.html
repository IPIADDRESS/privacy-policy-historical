The Company shall not be liable in any way for any illegitimate use of your data by third parties. Accordingly, for the exercise of the rights set out below in the paragraph “<em>Rights of the subjects concerned</em>” you are referred to the specific information to be made available to you by third parties in their position as independent Personal Data Controllers .</p>
<p>This notice is also in keeping with Recommendation no. 2/2001 that the European authorities for the protection of personal data, working as a Group set up pursuant to art. 29 of directive no. 95/46/CE, adopted on 17 May 2001 in order to identify certain minimum requirements for the on-line collection of personal data and, in particular, the modalities, timing and nature of the information that personal data controllers must provide to users connecting with a web page, irrespective of the purposes of the connection.</p>
<p>Specific summary information shall be given or displayed from time to time in the website pages concerning specific services supplied on request.</p>

<p>In the course of their normal operation, the IT systems and the software procedures used to operate this website acquire personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>
<p>Although personal information is not collected to be associated with identified subjects, nevertheless, on account of its very nature, through ad hoc processes and association with data held by third parties, personal information could lead to the identification of the users concerned.</p>
<p>This category of data includes the IP addresses and domain names of the computers used by the users to connect with the website, the addresses of the resources requested in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) notation, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in reply, the numerical code denoting the status of the reply by the server (completed successfully, error, etc.), and other parameters concerning the operating system and the IT environment of the users.</p>
<p>Such data are used for the sole purpose of collecting anonymous statistical information on the use of the website and to make sure that the site is working properly. Once processed, the data are deleted forthwith. The data might be used for the determination of accountability in the event of alleged IT crimes being committed against the website. Other than in this case, web contact data are not kept longer than fifteen days.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</span></strong></p>
<p>The website does not make use of cookies for the transmission of information of a personal nature, and the so-called permanent cookies are used solely for registered users, in encrypted mode, for the sole purpose of keeping their navigation sessions active.</p>
<p>The use of the so-called session cookies (which are not permanently saved in the user’s computer and disappear when the browser is closed) is strictly limited to the transmission of session identifiers (random numbers generated by the server) as needed to ensure an effective and secure exploration of the site.</p>
<p>The use of the so-called permanent cookies (lasting longer than the navigation session) are used solely to operate the user cart, if any. No tracing system is used for personal data and reserved information.</p>
<p>Users may configure their browser to reject cookies or to receive a warning every time a cookie is sent. To this end, users will find the instructions on how to disable the cookies in the tool bar of their browser, under the heading “Help”. However, this may affect the operation of some websites and our Company cannot ensure that its site will work properly when cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>The session cookies used avoid recourse to other IT techniques that may compromise the privacy of the users navigating the web, and do not permit the acquisition of a user’s personal ID data. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you claim that your personal information has been used in a manner that is improper and/or contrary to these Terms of Use or that we have otherwise violated your rights or privacy, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to Richard Spata, Chief Financial Officer, r.spata@todsgroup.com. We each agree to review and negotiate your claim in good faith. &nbsp;If we reject your claim or if we are unable to negotiate a resolution of your claim with you, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings which shall be conducted in New York, New York or such other jurisdiction as may be agreed by the parties in the interest of fairness and convenience.&nbsp; You agree that if you choose to pursue any such claim, you will pursue such claim in an arbitration proceeding (rather than in any judicial forum or court).&nbsp; Any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to use of your personal information and/or violation of your rights of privacy will be resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in the city of New York, New York, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall be authorized to award either party any remedy permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to pursue your claim in arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered &nbsp;to [name of agent] in order begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will arbitrate all disputes pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).
