    <h4>What Personal Information is Collected?</h4>
    <h5>Personal Information</h5>
    <p>
      When you purchase products on Tobi, we ask you for personal information. We use this information to process your orders and to communicate with you about the status of your membership, orders, and other transactions with us.
    </p>
    <p>
