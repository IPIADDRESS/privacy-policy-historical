<p><b>How Tower Hobbies Protects Your Online Privacy</b>

</p><p>Tower Hobbies is a firm believer in the protection of its online
customers' privacy. We have implemented a number of procedures and
policies which are designed to protect your personal information while
using our online services.

</p><p>Tower Hobbies has created this privacy statement in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses
our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site.

</p><p>Our site uses an order form for customers to request information,
products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like
their e-mail address) and financial information (like their account or
credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used
to send orders and information about our company to our customers. The
customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the
visitor when necessary and shared with other trusted companies who may want to
contact our visitors. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings;
see the information below. Financial information that is
collected is used to bill the user for products and services.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server,
and to administer our Web site. Our site uses "cookies" to keep track of your shopping cart.

</p><ul>

<li> Whenever sensitive personal or financial information is
transmitted, it is sent via a <a href="security.html">secured connection</a> directly to our
mainframe computer using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology. This
is the most successfully used method of ensuring private, secure
transmission of personal information over the Internet.

</li><li> Our online systems do not relay or retransmit your information
insecurely to other computers--when you send personal information
using our online ordering system, it is directly passed to our main
IBM AS/400 system.

</li><li> E-mail addresses are collected only for the purpose of contacting
you in the future. We WILL NOT share your e-mail address with other
companies or individuals.

</li><li> We do not collect the personal information for children under the age of 13.
We are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity
on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.
In cases where we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child,
the parent can always review this information, chose to have this information deleted
from our records and refuse to permit further collection or use of this information.

</li><li> We do occasionally share portions of our customer mailing list with
trusted and approved high-quality companies. We choose these
companies on a very high standard and will only allow postal mailings for
offers which we feel you may be interested in. We never release e-mail
addresses, phone numbers or financial information.

</li></ul>

This site gives users the following options for removing their
information from our database to not receive future communications or
to no longer receive our service.

<li>You can send e-mail to <a href="mailto:orders@towerhobbies.com">orders@towerhobbies.com</a>
