or other web sites owned or operated by Dotblu (the "Dotblu Sites")
(collectively or individually "Users") value their privacy. This
Privacy Notice details important information regarding the use and
disclosure of User information collected on the Dotblu Sites. Dotblu
provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an informed decision
about whether to use or continue using the Dotblu Sites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the <a href="http://townhog.com/tos">TownHog Terms of Use</a>.
Your use of the Dotblu Sites and any personal information you provide
on the Dotblu Sites remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice
and our <a href="http://townhog.com/tos">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that any video, image, or other content posted at the
direction of Users onto the dotblu Sites becomes published content and

Privacy Notice.</p>
<h3>The Information TownHog Collects</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b>User Provided Information:</b> You
provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address and phone number) to TownHog when choosing to participate in various
activities such as uploading files, posting messages, entering contests
or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys,
or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li><b>Cookies Information:</b> When you
visit the Dotblu Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text
file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer
that uniquely identifies your browser. TownHog uses both session cookies
and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close
your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on
subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by
following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is
temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset
your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
being sent. However, some features of the Dotblu Sites may not function
properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li><b>Log File Information:</b> When you
use the Dotblu Sites, our servers automatically record certain
information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.
These server logs may include information such as your web request,
Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language,
referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks,
domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages,
the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your
request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your
browser.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li><b>Clear GIFs Information/JavaScript:</b>
When you use the Dotblu Sites, we may employ "clear GIFs" (AKA Web
Beacons), or JavaScript, to track the online usage patterns of our
Users anonymously (i.e., in a nonpersonally identifiable manner).</li></ul>
<h3>The Way TownHog Uses Information</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li>If you submit personally identifiable
information to us through the Dotblu Sites, then we use your personal
information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and
functionality of the Dotblu Sites.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>Any personal information or content that you
voluntarily disclose online becomes publicly available and can be
collected and used by others. Any files that you share with friends may
be redistributed by them through the Internet and other media channels,
and may be viewed by the general public.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>We do not use your email address or other
personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing
messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program
or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We
may, however, use your email address without further consent for
nonmarketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Dotblu Site changes, townhogs that need to be settled, townhogs that
settle that you have been playing, monthly newsletters, comments on
your profile, messages sent to you from TownHog, and for customer
service purposes).</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>We use both your personally identifiable
information and certain nonpersonally identifiable information (such as
anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type,
clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Dotblu
Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and
services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and
trends.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>We use cookies, clear GIFs, and log file
information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to
re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the dotblu
Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c)
monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor
aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.;
and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions,
sweepstakes, and contests.</li></ul>
<h3>When TownHog Discloses Information</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li>We provide personally identifiable information
and nonpersonally identifiable information to our subsidiaries,
affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of
processing such information on our behalf. We require that these
parties agree to process such information in compliance with our
privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of
such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and
security measures.</li>
<p>The partners we currently share information with are the following:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><b>Yotify.com</b><br>
 <a href="http://www.yotify.com/misc/privacy.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.yotify.com/misc/privacy.aspx</a>
 </li></ul></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>We do not share your personally identifiable
information (such as name or email address) with other third party
companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or
except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have
the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>We do share nonpersonally identifiable
information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages
and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third
parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain
content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on
the Dotblu Sites.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>We may release personally identifiable
information and/or nonpersonally identifiable information if required
to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is
necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright
Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>Dotblu also reserves the right to disclose
personally identifiable information and/or nonpersonally identifiable
information that Dotblu believes, in good faith, is appropriate or
necessary to enforce our <a href="http://townhog.com/tos">Terms of Use</a>,
take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself
against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government
enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web
site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Dotblu, our Users or others.</li></ul>
<h3>Your Choices</h3>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable
information through the Dotblu Sites, in which case Dotblu may not be
able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your
personal profile information and email preferences at any time by
visiting your account profile page.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such
as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible
for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account
information at all times.</p>
<p>Please contact Dotblu with any questions or comments about this
Privacy Notice, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in
or opt-out choices.</p>
<h3>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>Dotblu allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
networks, to serve advertisements within the Dotblu Sites. These
third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly
to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Dotblu
Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or
Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and
to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
<p>Dotblu does not provide any personally identifiable information to
these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or
except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have
the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an
advertiser asks Dotblu to show an advertisement to a certain audience
(for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men
ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond
to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that
you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The
advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Dotblu
Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any
personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver
to you.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these
third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more
information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out
of certain practices. Dotblu's privacy policy does not apply to, and we
cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
<p>Currently, Dotblu has relationships with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><b>Google, inc.</b> - 
<a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a><br>
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on dotblu.<br>
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to dotblu and other sites on the Internet.<br>
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>
<p>Dotblu uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your
personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the
security of any information you transmit to Dotblu and you do so at
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Dotblu
makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our
systems. However, please note this is not a guarantee that such
information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by
breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>If Dotblu learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt
to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
protective steps. Dotblu may post a notice on the Dotblu Sites if a
security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a
legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To
receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your
consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us via
email.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment to Childrens' Privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
For that reason, Dotblu does not knowingly collect or maintain
personally identifiable information or nonpersonally identifiable
information on the Dotblu Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and
no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are
under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Dotblu
Sites at any time or in any manner. If Dotblu learns that personally
identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been
collected on the Dotblu Sites without verified parental consent, then Dotblu will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>
<h3>Special Note to International Users</h3>
<p>The Dotblu Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended
for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User
accessing the Dotblu Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other
region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection,
use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be
advised that through your continued use of the Dotblu Sites, which are
governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our <a href="http://townhog.com/tos">Terms of Use</a>, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
<h3>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>In the event that Dotblu is acquired by or merged with a third party
entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to
transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as
part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In
the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights
generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information
is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<h3>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Notice</h3>
<p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be
reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to
stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal
information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect
when we received the personal information you provided. Your continued
use of the Dotblu Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy
Notice and any future revisions.</p>
<p>For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less
restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you
have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent
before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.</p>
