<p>
ToLuna USA complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
</p>

<h3> Commitment </h3>
<p>
<b>ToLuna USA</b> is an online data collection company focused on providing high quality data to the full-service marketing research industry, advertizing agencies and consultancies. We build and maintain large online consumer Panels. You can be assured your privacy and the confidentiality of your information is our number one priority. All of the data that ToLuna USA collects in our research studies report as aggregate information, that is, information about groups - not individuals. Individual information is never reviewed or published without your consent, as it is irrelevant to the research conducted by our clients. All individual information provided is held confidential in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3> The Information We Gather </h3>
<p>
ToLuna USA gathers personal information when individuals register to become member of our panels, after registration we ask panel members to provide us with more personal information so that we may invite them to appropriate surveys. To become a panel member, we ask that you fill out a registration survey that gathers some personal and general consumer information. We ask for your email address so that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is for matching you with the appropriate marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify for particular projects. All email contact from <b>ToLuna USA</b> will be sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon registration. If you become a panel member, your information (name, address, city, state, and Zip) is also used for the purposes of incentive fulfillment. When incentive points are deposited in your account and you wish to redeem them, this information is required so that we may send your reward to the appropriate recipient address. From time to time, a third party may be used for issuing checks or processing the delivery of rewards; your personally identifiable information will not be used for any other reason, but to mail you your reward.
</p>
<p>
If you take a survey or provide us with personal information without being a member of our panel, the only personally identifiable information we will preserve is your email address, gender, age, ethnicity and zip code, machine ID and IP address. We do this so we may contact you if you have won a prize or are entitled to an incentive, to match you to appropriate surveys and improve the user experience. Unless you elect to become a member of the <b>ToLuna USA</b> panel, we will not contact you for any reason other than to notify you that you have won a prize or are eligible for an incentive. If you are entitled to a prize or an incentive, we will collect and maintain such personally identifiable information, as we are required to maintain or report by virtue of any law or regulation.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to use our referral service to invite a friend to join ToLuna, we will ask you for your friend’s email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. ToLuna stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may contact us at <a href="http://us.toluna.com/contactus" target="_blank">http://us.toluna.com/contactus</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>
<p>
If you use the Community Forum Area on our website to post blogs, bulletins or chat with fellow community members, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
</p>
<h3> Use of This Information </h3>
<p>
ToLuna USA does not sell or transfer the personally identifiable information collected about the members of its panels or the individuals that take surveys for us. Information which is personally identifiable will only be transferred with your prior permission on a case by case basis. If you are a member of the <b>ToLuna USA</b> panel, your information is stored in our proprietary database so we may call upon it to determine which people match up with specific research studies. If we think your profile makes you a potential candidate for a study, we will email you an invitation to make you aware of this opportunity. From time to time <b>ToLuna USA</b> may use third-party software for email list management and email distribution, or may use third party list management providers to match the members of our Panel to members of other lists or panels, or to validate accuracy of personal information you provide. We may use third parties to provide us with data they have collected about you, and append this data to your demographic profile. In such cases only a minimum amount of information is transferred to these third parties so as to enable them to perform specific functions on our behalf.

</p><h3>Digital Finger printing:</h3>
In general, digital fingerprinting technologies assign a unique identifier or “Machine-ID” to a user’s computer to identify and track the computer. ToLuna USA will not use digital fingerprinting technology (the “Technology”) to collect Personal Information, or track the online activities, of the user of a computer; and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or control of a computer or alter, modify or change the settings or functionality of a computer.

The Technology will analyze publicly available information and data obtained from the computer’s web browser and from other publicly available data points, including without limitation the technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, and the computer’s IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned to the computer. The unique identifier will be an alpha-numeric id. After creating the unique identifier, ToLuna USA does not retain the information analyzed by the Technology to create the unique identifier. In furtherance of ToLuna USA’s efforts to assist its clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of survey results, ToLuna USA (a) may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your Personal Information; (b) may share your unique identifier with ToLuna USA’s clients and with other sample or panel providers; and (c) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including without limitation a sample or panel provider or a client of ToLuna USA. Any unique identifier(s) received or obtained by ToLuna USA and linked to a specific individual will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<p></p>
<p>
ToLuna USA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Technology is safe, secure and do not cause undue privacy or data security risks.
</p>
<p>
ToLuna USA shall use and distribute the Technology in a professional and ethical manner and in accordance with (a) ToLuna USA’s privacy policy, (b) any statements and/or disclosures made by ToLuna USA to respondents, and (c) applicable Laws and Codes.
</p>
<p>
In the event that ToLuna USA discovers or learns of any unethical conduct in connection with the use of the Technology, or that the Technology is being used in a manner that is inconsistent with the statements and/or disclosures made by ToLuna USA to respondents or in violation of applicable Laws and Codes, ToLuna USA will take immediate action to prohibit such unethical conduct and to ensure the proper administration of the Technology.
