    <h3>Tree of Life Privacy Statement</h3>
    <p> The Tree of Life (ToL) Project is committed to respecting the privacy 
        of those who visit the ToL website and those who contribute materials 
        to the project or participate in discussions administrated by the project. 
        Please review the ToL Privacy Policy set forth below so that you can understand 
        your options in using the Tree of Life website and its services.</p>
    <p> The ToL is a not-for-profit project and does not engage in e-commerce. 
        The ToL does not sell or rent any information about its visitors or contributors 
        to third parties, and we do not contact visitors or contributors to promote 
        or sell any product.</p>
    <a name="coverage" id="coverage"></a> 
    <h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
    <p> This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information 
        (e.g. first and last names, email address, a home or physical address, 
        a telephone number, institution or affiliation) that the ToL Project may 
        hold. You can visit the ToL website without identifying who you are, or 
        revealing personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p> Any personally identifiable information the ToL obtains about a contributor 
        or visitor is information supplied voluntarily as part of using the website 
        or signing up for a particular service or activity, or in requesting information 
        from the ToL Project.</p>
    <p> The ToL Project is not responsible for the privacy practices of other 
        websites, services or organizations to which a ToL webpage or service 
        may link or refer.</p>
    <a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a> 
    <h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
    <p> The ToL Project only uses the personal information that you provide in 
        order to record and support your activities within the ToL website and 
        web-based services and to provide you information about the ToL and related 
        activities. Personal information about ToL contributors and visitors may 
        be shared only with ToL contractors, auditors, consultants, and collaborators. 
        The ToL informs recipients of information about safeguarding personal 
        information and requires them to use it only for an authorized purpose 
        consistent with this privacy policy, and to return it or destroy it upon 
        completion of the activity.</p>
    <p> The ToL will disclose your personal information if required to do so by 
        law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform 
        to the edicts of the law or comply with legal processes served to you, 
        the ToL, or the site.</p>
    <a name="generaluse" id="generaluse"></a> 
    <h3>General Use of the ToL Website and Services</h3>
    <p> The ToL website and related search and discovery systems maintain raw 
        log files of documents retrieved and search queries entered. Information 
        extracted from these log files (e.g. the pages requested, referral URLs, 
        estimation of time spent on a page, estimation of a user session, result 
        sets from search queries) is processed in aggregate to help the ToL gauge 
        the effectiveness of its website and services, improve the performance 
        and structure of its website and services, and for generating general 
        use statistics. The ToL may share this type of information with its collaborators, 
        sponsors, consultants, and contractors to evaluate and improve the site.</p>
    <a name="identify" id="identify"></a> 
    <h4>Persistent Identifiers</h4>
    <p> In order to use some ToL services, a user may be required to have a persistent 
        identifier (e.g. a login identifier.) These identifiers may link to personally 
        identifiable information the user supplies as part of registering or signing 
        up for a service. These identifiers will not be linked to general use 
        information except where the user has explicitly agreed to this action 
        when signing up for the service (and where it may be a requirement to 
        use the service) or when a user has volunteered to participate in an evaluation 
        study of ToL use.</p>
    <a name="ipdomain" id="ipdomain"></a> 
    <h4>IP Numbers and Domain Names</h4>
    <p> IP numbers and domain names are included in the raw log files and are 
        used in helping to compute aggregate statistics (e.g. as a basis for defining 
        a use session.) These IP numbers are not used to link the ToL use to any 
        other personally identifiable information that the ToL may hold.</p>
    <a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a> 
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p> The ToL website or service may use cookies to improve a visitor's interaction 
        with the site or service. The ToL does not use cookies to track visitors 
        except in conjunction with a service that requires keeping track of a 
        user's sessions, or actions, for example, a service allowing a user to 
        keep certain features (such as the on-page glossary, navigation menus, 
        etc.) turned on or off while moving from page to page on the ToL website.</p>
    <a name="forums" id="forums"></a> 
    <h4>ToL Discussion Forums and Email Lists</h4>
    <p> The ToL will host and maintain a number of public email lists and forums 
        for use by interested individuals. Some will be open for subscription 
        and use; others will be moderated, i. e., a list or forum moderator may 
        limit subscription and posting access. In each case, users can subscribe 
        and unsubscribe from these areas at any time.</p>
    <p> Please note that any information that you post to a public bulletin board 
        is available to all visitors accessing that site. Unsubscribing from a 
        list or forum will not remove any name, email address or information that 
        was part of any previous posting from any archive of these lists or forums. 
        In cases where this information came from information submitted in any 
        registration process, the information in the public forum will not be 
        removed when the registration is terminated and the registration information 
        removed.</p>
    <a name="contributors" id="contributors"></a> 
    <h3>Personal Information About ToL Content Contributors</h3>
    <p>ToL content contributors must register before being able to upload materials 
        to the ToL database. Upon registration, contributors are asked to provide 
        personal identifying information. The type of information requested depends 
        upon the nature of a person's contribution. Currently, the ToL distinguishes 
        four contributor categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#images">ToL Media Contributors</a></li>
        <li><a href="#treehouse">ToL Treehouse Contributors</a></li>
        <li><a href="#classroom">ToL Treehouse Classroom Contributors</a></li>
        <li><a href="#scientific">ToL Scientific Contributors</a></li>
    </ul>
    <a name="images" id="images"></a> 
    <h4>ToL Media Contributors</h4>
    <p>ToL media contributors must be at least 18 years old. Upon registration, 
        they are asked to provide the following information:</p>
    <table class="required">

                    can contact the contributor with questions regarding their 
                    images or other media. Throughout the ToL site, email addresses

                    by spambots.</p>
                <p>Upon request, a contributor's e-mail address is withheld from 
                    publication on the ToL web site. If a contributor chooses 
                    to have his or her e-mail address withheld from publication,

    <p><em>Note: For the time being, we can only register treehouse builders who 
        are at least 18 years of age. We are working on special privacy and parental

        (see <a href="#children">guidelines for children</a> below), but we need

    <h3>Guidelines for Children</h3>
    <p><em>Note: We are working on special privacy and parental involvement tools 
        that will allow us to work with young treehouse builders under 18 years 
        of age, but we need a little more time to get this system up and running. 
        The following procedures will be implemented as soon as the new tools 
        are made available on the ToL site.</em> </p>
    <p>Children and teenagers are advised to consult with their parents before 
        registering for any service or giving any personal information online. 
        Children and teenagers under 18 are eligible to register as Young ToL 
        Treehouse Builders. The Tree of Life Project collects and stores the names 
        and e-mail addresses of all Young Treehouse Builders. These data are maintained 
        for the sole purpose of protecting the security and liability of the site 
        or responding to law enforcement, if necessary.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html">Children's 
        Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a>, the Tree of Life Project maintains 
        the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information collected 
        from children. A child's personal information will be published on the 
        ToL site only after a parent has submitted a Parental Consent Form <em>(coming 
        soon!)</em>. Parents are provided access to their child’s personal 
        information and can delete the child’s personal information and 
        opt-out of future collection or use of the information. </p>
    <p>Upon registration as a Young Treehouse Builder, a child will be asked to 
        provide the following information:</p>
