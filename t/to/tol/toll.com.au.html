            <p>The Toll Group is committed to protecting the health and safety 
              of its employees, suppliers, customers and others who may be affected 
              by its activities.</p>
            <p> Toll’s objective is to provide all personnel at our sites 
              with an environment which is free of risk to their health and safety. 
              Health and Safety at work shall be both an individual and shared 
              responsibility.</p>
            <p>Commitment to safety is a team commitment involving managers, supervisors, 
              employees and subcontractors working together through consultation 
              and co-operation. It is unacceptable for any individual to observe 
              non-compliance with safety standards without immediately addressing 
              and correcting that non-compliance with the personnel concerned.</p>

            <h2><a name="Environment"></a>Environmental Policy</h2>
            <p> The Toll Group is committed to being an environmentally responsible 
              company. Legal compliance is regarded as a minimum standard and 
              actions beyond statutory regulations, which conserve or protect 
              the environment and support business goals are encouraged.</p>
            <p> The company participates in recycling programs, and promotes conservation 
              of natural resources such as, electricity, fuel and gas.</p>
            <p> On all company premises, particular attention will be given to 
              the storage and transport of Dangerous Goods, containment of run 
              off from workshops and washdown areas, and the safety and integrity 
              of underground fuel tanks. <br>
              The company is particularly mindful of the effect of heavy vehicles 
              on the environment, hence promoting a policy of regular maintenance 
              and monitoring of emissions for company vehicles.</p>

            <h2><a name="Health"></a>Health Information Management Statement - 
              July 2002</h2>
            <p>The Toll group of companies ("Toll") provides a range 
              of integrated logistics services through its constituent businesses. 
              Toll interacts with its clients, employees and suppliers of goods 
              and services in the conduct of those businesses and ancilliary activities.</p>
            <p> In the course of conducting its businesses Toll at times collects, 
              uses and may disclose health information of the kind referred to 
              in the Victorian Health Records Act 2001 ("Health Information"). 
              In the great majority of cases where Toll requires such information 
              it is within the context of the normal employment relationship with 
              its employees. </p>
            <p>Protecting Health Information provided to us is important. This 
              Health Information Management Statement is intended to help you 
              understand how Toll manages Health Information in accordance with 
              the Health Privacy Principles contained in the Health Records Act 
              2001 (Victoria).</p>
            <p><strong>Collection and Use of Health Information </strong></p>
            <p> In its capacity as an integrated provider of logistics and an 
              employer, Toll collects and uses Health Information about its employees 
              in particular, and at times about sub-contractors and others with 
              whom it deals. In the case of its employees this occurs primarily 
              in relation to assessing the fitness of individuals for particular 
              tasks, and in relation to absences or incapacity due to accident, 
              injury or illness. For non-employees, any Health Information is 
              likely to only be collected or used in connection with personal 
              injury or hurt to an individual which arises within the business 
              relationship. Toll's collection and use or disclosure of Health 
              Information is for these primary purposes. In most circumstances 
              the Health Information relates to the provision of medical certificates 
              or reports. Toll has legal and statutory obligations in relation 
              to the collection and use of some of this Health Information.</p>
            <p>To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of Health Information, 
              Toll will normally only disclose Health Information it holds to 
              the individual concerned or to someone having proper authorisation 
              or authority to request such information, or to fulfil legal or 
              regulatory requirements. Toll may also disclose Health Information 
              to its advisers and other parties in connection with the present 
              and future conduct of its business.</p>
            <p><strong>Access and Correction</strong></p>
            <p> Toll endeavours to ensure that Health Information it collects 
              and uses is accurate and current. Individuals can contact the Company 
              Secretary (see below) for details of Health Information which may 
              be held about them or to correct any Health Information held. If 
              deemed necessary from time to time, a fee may be charged for the 
              provision of Health Information.</p>
            <p> <strong>Storage and Security of Health Information</strong></p>
            <p> Health Information is principally held within employment records 
              in a secure and confidential environment. </p>
            <p><strong>Changes to this statement</strong></p>
            <p> Any changes made to this statement from time to time will be incorporated 
              in an updated version which will be made available on our website
