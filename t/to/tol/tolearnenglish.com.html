<p><b><span class="bodytext">We are committed to protecting your privacy while

  by ToLearnEnglish and/or other persons or entities, with whom such information 
  may be shared, your choices regarding the collection, use and distribution of 
  such information, your ability to edit, update, correct or delete such information 
  and the security procedures that we have implemented to protect your privacy.

<p><b><span class="bodytext"><font color="#FF0000">The Information We Collect</font></span></b></p>
<p><b>When you visit the site, no information is stored into a database. We don't 
  ask you to register or to give us personal information. Yet, when you join our

<p><b><span class="bodytext">In addition, ToLearnEnglish has several special relationships 
  with other web sites ("Partners"). In some instances, the site or 
  area of the site is "co-branded" with or "powered by" a 
  Partner's logo or a Partner's name may appear in the URL. When you provide registration 
  data on a co-branded site or area, personal and/or aggregate data may be shared 
  with that partner. You should review the individual privacy policies of these 
  partners and make an informed decision about whether to continue. You may opt-out 
  of sharing your information with that partner by choosing not to register or 
  use that site or service. For a listing of all of ToLearnEnglish Partners with 
  which we maintain information sharing arrangements, please contact us. <br>
  </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="bodytext"><font color="#FF0000">Banner ads</font><br>
  ToLearnEnglish uses leading third-party advertising companies to display ads 
  on our Site and through our tools. ToLearnEnglish shares web site usage information 
  about visitors to the Site with these companies for the purpose of targeting 
  our Internet banner advertisements on the Site and other web sites. For this 
  purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some of the pages you 
  visit on the Site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The 
  information collected by our third-party advertising company through the use 
  of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable. In addition, our third-party 
  advertising company may display banner ads that contain "cookies." 
  The "cookies" received with these banner ads are collected by our 
  third-party advertising company and we do not have access to this information.

<p><b><span class="bodytext"> <font color="#FF0000">Public Forums</font><br>
  The Site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, instant messaging, and web 
  polls available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed 
  in these areas becomes public information and users should exercise caution 
  when deciding to disclose information.<br>

<p><b><span class="bodytext"><font color="#FF0000">Protection of Children</font><br>
