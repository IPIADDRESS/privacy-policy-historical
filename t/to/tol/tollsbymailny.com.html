Thank you for visiting the Tolls by Mail website. Xerox State &amp; Local Solutions,
Inc. (“Xerox”) maintains this website on behalf of the New York State Thruway Authority, Metropolitan Transportation
Authority Bridges &amp; Tunnels (collectively, “New York Authorities”) and the Port

make it easier and more efficient for individuals and businesses to get information about Tolls by Mail and to maintain
their Tolls by Mail accounts. The Authorities and Xerox recognize that it is critical for individuals and businesses to be
confident that their privacy is protected when they visit the Tolls by Mail website.
<p><span>This policy describes the Authorities’ privacy practices regarding information collected

</p><p><span>For the purposes of this policy, “personal information” means any information concerning a
natural person, as opposed to a corporate entity, which, because of name, number, symbol, mark, or other identifier,
can be used to identify that natural person.  The Authorities and Xerox only collect personal information about you
when you provide that information voluntarily by sending an email or by initiating an online transaction, such as
paying a Toll Bill or modifying an existing Tolls by Mail account.</span>

</li></ul>
<span>None of the foregoing information is deemed to constitute personal information.</span>
<p><span>The Authorities and Xerox use the information that is collected automatically to improve
this website's content and to help the Authorities and Xerox understand how users are interacting with the website.

and least interest to our users, and to improve the utility of the material available on the website. The
information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and the Authorities and Xerox do not sell or otherwise
disclose the information collected from this website for commercial marketing purposes.</span>
</p><p><span></span></p><h4>Cookies</h4>
Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser to provide a means of distinguishing
among users of this website.  The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites.  To better serve
you, the Authorities and Xerox may use “session cookies” to enhance or customize your visit to this website.  Session
cookies can be created automatically on the device you use to access this website.  These session cookies do not
contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security. The Authorities and Xerox may use the
cookie feature to store a randomly generated identifying tag on the device you use to access this website. A
session cookie is erased during operation of your browser or when your browser is closed. 
<p><span>At times you may be asked if you would like to personalize this website by allowing the
Authorities and Xerox to store a “persistent cookie” on your computer’s hard drive.  This persistent cookie will
allow the website to recognize you when you visit again and tailor the information presented to you based on your
needs and interests.  The Authorities and Xerox use persistent cookies only with your permission.</span>
</p><p><span>The software and hardware you use to access this website allows you to refuse new cookies
or delete existing cookies.  Refusing or deleting these cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some
features of this website.</span>
</p><p><span></span></p><h4>Information Collected When You Email this Website or Initiate an Online Transaction </h4><br>
During your visit to this website you may send an email or submit a feedback form to the Authorities and Xerox.  If
so, the Authorities and Xerox will collect your email address and the contents of your message. The information
collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video and graphic information formats included
in the message.  The Authorities and Xerox may use your email address and the information included in your message
to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this website, or to forward your message to another
State agency or authority for appropriate action.  The Authorities and Xerox do not collect your email address for
commercial purposes and the Authorities and Xerox do not sell or otherwise disclose your email address for commercial
purposes.
<p><span>During your visit to this website you may initiate a transaction such as Viewing, Paying or Resolving your Toll Bill. The Authorities and Xerox may use the
information, including personal information, that you volunteered by paying a Toll Bill or modifying your Tolls by Mail account. The Authorities and
Xerox may disclose such information for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms
of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted.</span>
</p><p><span>The Authorities and Xerox do not knowingly collect personal information from children or
create profiles of children through this website.  Users are cautioned, however, that the Authorities and Xerox will
treat personal information submitted in an email or transaction as though it was submitted by an adult, and such
information may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access.  The Authorities
and Xerox strongly encourage parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to provide
guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.</span>
</p><p><span></span></p><h4>Information and Choice</h4>
As noted above, the Authorities and Xerox do not collect any personal information about you during your visit to
this website unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an email, submitting an online form, or
initiating an online transaction such as paying a Toll Bill or  modifying an existing Tolls by Mail account.  You may choose not to send the Authorities and Xerox an email, submit an online form or initiate an online
transaction.  While your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to receive specific
services or products through this website, it will not prevent you from requesting services or products from the
Authorities and Xerox by other means and will not normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other
features of the website, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.
<p><span></span></p><h4>Disclosure of Information Collected Through This Website </h4>
For the New York Authorities, and Xerox when acting on behalf of the New York Authorities, the collection of
