Created: April 25, 2017<br>
<br>
ToryWorks, Corp. (“TORYCOMICS”) respects the privacy rights of its
users and protects the personal information collected, stored and used
in connection with our service (our "Service"). To further this
commitment, we have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to
guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.<br>
By accessing our Service, including registering for a TORYCOMICS
account, downloading and using software made available by TORYCOMICS,
or by clicking the “I accept” button (or its equivalent), you are
accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY</span><br>
This Privacy Policy describes TORYCOMICS’s collection and use of
personal information submitted and collected through our Service.
Personal information includes any individually identifiable information
about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail
address, and information concerning you collected and/or maintained in
personally identifiable form.<br>
Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from our
Service may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy
does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other
advertisers or websites.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span><br>
We may collect and process the following data about you:<br>
• Personal information such as your name, address, telephone number,
e-mail address, and credit card number when you register for an account
with TORYCOMICS, make sales inquiries, request support, or make a
purchase or payment.<br>
• We collect certain information automatically and store it in log
files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses,
operating system, browser type, date/time stamp, and/or program or
system error messages and other system information. We may combine this
automatically collected log information with other information we
collect about you to improve our Service, to improve marketing,
analytics, or website functionality.<br>
• If you contact us or respond to messages and communications that we
send to you, we may keep a record of that correspondence.<br>
• We collect details of your use of our Service and the resources that
you access. Such usage information includes information about how, when
and from where you access or use our Service.<br>
• User feedback, community discussions, chats and other interactions on
our Service.<br>
• If you access our Service on your mobile telephone or other mobile
device, including tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers,
including MAC Address, and IP Address. Certain aspects of our Service
will create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to
an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with
your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other
information you choose to provide or allow us to access, such as
geo-location.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
&amp; COOKIES</span><br>
TORYCOMICS and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics
providers, may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags
and scripts. These technologies are used in analyzing trends,
administering our websites, tracking users’ movements around the
websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as
a whole. We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping
cart, to remember users’ settings, and for authentication. Users can
control the use of cookies by adjusting individual browser settings.
However, if you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but
your ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be
limited.<br>
We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know
which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge
the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of
our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are
tied to personally identifiable information.<br>
We may also use tools or third party analytical software to
automatically collect and use certain non-personal information that
does not directly enable TORYCOMICS to identify you.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. USE AND SHARING OF
INFORMATION COLLECTED</span><br>
We use your personal information and non-personal information, both
individually or combined together:<br>
• To help us manage, operate and deliver our Service to you<br>
• To improve your experience with our Service<br>
• To develop new products or services for you<br>
• To provide you with customer and technical support<br>
• To provide you with software updates<br>
• To communicate with you about our Service (unless you have not
consented to allow us to use your information for these purposes)<br>
• For marketing and promotional purposes<br>
• For internal training purposes and statistical analysis<br>
TORYCOMICS does not sell or rent your personal information to
third-parties for marketing purposes without your consent. However, you
hereby agree that TORYCOMICS may share your personal information with
our affiliates to provide you our Service or information about other
services and promotional materials. In addition, TORYCOMICS may share
personal information with third party service providers that assist
TORYCOMICS in providing you our Service. As a result, your information
may be transferred to countries outside your residence.<br>
When we share your personal information with third party vendors and
suppliers, we require them to adhere to confidentiality and
non-disclosure obligations.<br>
If the ownership or control of all or part of our Service or their
assets changes, we may transfer your personal information to the new
owner.<br>
Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial
authorities to provide personal information to the appropriate
governmental authorities. We will disclose personal information upon
receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law
enforcement investigation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY
SITES OR SERVICES</span><br>
You should be aware that our Service may from time to time contain
links to third-party sites, products or services. TORYCOMICS is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites or
services. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain
third party, you should read the privacy policy of the site or service
to which you link before you submit any personal information.<br>
We may also use Google remarketing services, which allow third parties,
including Google, to serve advertisements to you on our behalf based on
your activity on our Service. This involves placing in certain areas of
our Service a small piece of code provided by Google. This code enables
third parties, including Google, to place a cookie on your computer
that tells them about your use of our Service and allows them to
recognize you and display relevant advertisements when you visit other
websites within the Google Display Network. We may also use similar
remarketing services from other companies. If you would like to opt-out
of Google Analytics collecting data from your browser when you visit
websites, you can download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out
Browser Add-on here:https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">6. ACCESS TO PERSONAL

your personal information to resolve disputes, enforce TORYCOMICS user
agreement(s), and comply with technical and legal requirements and
constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our

the removal of information collected and already put in aggregate form

undue burden to us. We are not able nor are we obligated to remove any
of your information from a third party provider or platform. Moreover,
