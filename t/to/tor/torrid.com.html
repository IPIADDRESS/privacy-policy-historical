          <p>Respecting and protecting the privacy of users of torrid.com (the  ''Site'') is of great importance to us at Torrid. This notice describes  our policies of information collection and our use practices with  respect to the Site, and highlights choices you may have about the way  we use and share such information. Please read and understand this  policy so that you can understand how we use your personal  information.&nbsp; Please be aware that if you use the Site, register in any  fashion in connection with the Site, or participate in a survey,  contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion available on the Site, you are  agreeing to both the terms of our privacy policies and our Terms of Use  set forth elsewhere on the Site, each as in effect from time to time.&nbsp;  Please also be aware we reserve the right at our discretion to make  changes to this policy at any time, and all such changes shall be  immediately applicable.&nbsp; Please check this page periodically for  changes.&nbsp; Our privacy policies and information collection and use  practices in connection with the Site may vary from related policies  and practices related to our offline activities such as our stores and  our offline marketing activities.</p>
          <strong>Collection of Information</strong>
          <p>On the Site, you may be able to purchase merchandise, participate in  our community features like chat rooms or bulletin boards, become a  registered user, maintain a “wish list” or store other information on  the Site, enter sweepstakes and contests, participate in surveys and  polls, e-mail or instant message, subscribe to a service, or enroll to  receive certain entertainment or information.&nbsp; We may need or request  certain types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information  that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be  contacted, such as name, address, age, date of birth, sex, grade level,  e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and credit card  information) and collect it in connection with these various activities  and offerings.&nbsp; We do not consider indications of your interests, likes  and dislikes, or general characteristics such as clothing size or hair  color, to be personally identifiable information unless it is somehow  grouped with other information so as to permit identification of you  specifically; but from time to time we collect such information also,  in order to provide you better service or to get to know our user base  and its general traits.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For  example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an  electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it  sent directly to a friend, you might submit the friend's name and  address, should we be offering that service.&nbsp; The types of personally  identifiable information that may be collected about other people at  these pages may include: recipient's name, address, age, date of birth,  grade level, e-mail address, sex and telephone number.</p>
          <p>The personal information you provide is considered a company asset  and may be included among our transferred assets and the assets of any  or all of our subsidiaries or affiliates if any of their assets is ever  acquired by a third party. </p>
          <strong>Use of Information</strong>
          <p>We use personally identifiable information for various purposes.&nbsp;  For example, we may use information you provide to process your  purchases of merchandise or to provide for merchandise delivery to your  home.&nbsp; As a registered user, you provide us with information that we  maintain and reference as part of our attempts to provide better and  more personalized service to you.&nbsp; We might also use online registries  or other databases to permit you to use and participate in certain  portions in or features of our Site.&nbsp; We also use information users  provide to conduct sweepstakes and contests, notify you if you win, and  fulfill prizes or awards.&nbsp; In addition, unless you tell us not to, we  like to provide you with certain information about our merchandise,  sales or other offerings, and other marketing materials designed to  help you use our Site and visit our stores with more information.&nbsp; We  also use such information to make our online marketing and other  communications with you more efficient.&nbsp; Similarly, we may use  personally identifiable information in connection with certain of our  activities with our partners, such as marketing efforts,  co-sponsorships, and other initiatives.&nbsp; We also collect this  information as may be reasonably necessary for tracking/verifying  compliance with federal, state and local laws or for editorial and  feedback solicitation purposes.</p>
          <p>We may from time to time augment information you give us with  information from other sources, such as information validating your  address. Thus, information we obtain through the Site may be  intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained  through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online  sources. </p>
          <p>We sometimes share personal information given to us with third  parties.&nbsp; For instance, there may be third party service providers for  our operations or business activities, with whom we have an agreement  for services who transmit, store, analyze or otherwise use such  information in connection with their services to us.&nbsp; We also  occasionally share information about our users with advertisers,  business partners, sponsors and other third parties in aggregate, not  as individuals. For example, we will say torrid.com’s visitors are x  percent females, and x percent males.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>We may offer e-mail services, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions  that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies.  Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain  personally identifiable information that site visitors voluntarily  submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We  have no control over the use of this information by these companies. </p>
          <strong>Opting Out</strong>
          <p>We strive to make sure your preferences are respected.&nbsp; Therefore,  you can tell us if you don’t want us to share your personal information  with third parties (other than in connection with administration of the  Site or use over which we have no control, as described above) and we  will do our best to respect that.&nbsp; In any event, when you receive  e-mails or other communications from us our our partners, you should  have the ability to “opt out” of receiving any further such  communications, and we encourage you to exercise those rights should  you see fit.&nbsp; Note that if you’ve signed up or provided information at  different times for different purposes, you may have to opt out  multiple times.&nbsp; If you don’t want to reply to an e-mail you receive,  or want a simpler way to opt out of receiving e-mails from us, you can  just tell us what you want by contacting: </p>
