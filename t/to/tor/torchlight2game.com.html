    <em>Last updated August 10, 2011</em>
  </strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
  Our Privacy Commitment
</p>

<p>
  Runic Games, Inc. ("<strong>Runic</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>") is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the Runic websites where this Privacy Policy is posted (the “<strong>Site(s)</strong>”) (we refer to the Site(s), the services and the video games made available through the Site(s), collectively, as the “<strong>Runic Features</strong>”).  As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site(s) and users of the Runic Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site(s).  By visiting the Site(s) or using any of the Runic Features, you consent to Runic’s collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site(s) and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site(s) which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.
</p>

This policy answers the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</li>
  <li>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</li>
  <li>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</li>
  <li>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
  What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?
</p>

<p><strong>Types of Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p>
  Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information to access certain areas of the Site(s), but if you do not want to disclose certain personal information to us, you will not be able to access certain aspects of the Runic Features.
</p>

  We collect personal information when you create an account through the Runic Features; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in chat rooms, forums, polls, surveys, and questionnaires; participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions; purchase a product through the Runic Features; register a product that you have purchased; or receive customer or technical support.
</p>

<p>
  To create an account for the Runic Features, we require you to provide your name, date of birth and email address.  You will also need to create a screen name and you may choose to provide us information for certain instant messaging programs (such as AIM, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo Messenger and Skype) that you may use if you would like us or other users of the Runic Features to contact you through IM.  When you are purchasing products through the Runic Features, in addition to your name, e-mail address and screen name that you choose, we will ask for your shipping and billing address, telephone number and credit card or other payment information.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, we may also collect other types of information (known as demographic information) such as your gender, hobbies, occupation, platform preferences, and other game ownership information. This demographic information may be associated with your personal information.
</p>

<p>
<strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service questions or issues; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers. We also use your e-mail address to send you messages about the Runic Features and other general announcements.  If you provide us your IM screen names, we and other users will be able to contact you through the IM screen names that you submit, and those screen names will be made publicly available to other users through your forum or other Runic Features profiles.
</p>

<p>
We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Runic Features.

In addition, we will share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:
<ul>

  <li> Asset transfers.  If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of Runic’s assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Runic Features, could be included in the transferred assets.  Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on the Site(s).</li>
  <li> Service Providers.  We may share your personal information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf.  For example, have partnered with other companies to maintain or manage the Runic Features and our video games, fulfilling product orders and processing payments.  Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process consumer surveys, fulfill prizes, or to process, analyze, and/or store data.

To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
  <li> Publishing Partners.  We may share your email address with our publishing partner, Perfect World Entertainment, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “<strong>Perfect World</strong>”) for the purpose of notifying you about our products and services, including, but not limited to, contests, promotions, or special events and offers related to the Runic Features that Perfect World provides.

<p>
<strong>Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties</strong>
</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site(s). Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information.  You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.

You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Seattle, Washington with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</strong></em></span>
</p>

<p>
The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information.  In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Runic employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Runic Features.  All Runic personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information.  However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of any of the Runic Features and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk.  Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.
