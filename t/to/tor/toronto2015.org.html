the 2015 Pan American and Parapan American Games</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Toronto
Organizing Committee for the 2015 Pan American and Parapan American Games
(“TO2015™”) is a not-for–profit organization the mandate of which is to plan,
organize, promote, finance and stage the Pan/ParaPan American Games to be held
in the Golden Horseshoe Region of southern Ontario in the summer of 2015 (the “Games”).</p>
<p><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">OBJECTIVES</span><br><br></p>
<p>This Privacy
Policy has been developed by TO2015™ as an extension of our desire to combine
our commitment to the delivery of excellent Games with the highest level of
integrity and transparency in dealing with our stakeholders. The Policy is
designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard the
personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed
decisions when communicating with us and receiving news and related content
through our online properties. It reflects our commitment to protecting the
privacy and confidentiality of the personal information entrusted to us by our
stakeholders. This Policy will be continuously assessed against new
technologies, business practices, and stakeholder needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Policy applies to all current and prospective
stakeholders of TO2015™ as well as to users of our online properties. It is to be read in conjunction with our Terms of Use
which can be found at&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Terms of Use" href="lang/en/website-terms-of-use.html">www.toronto2015.org/lang/en/website-terms-of-use.html</a>.</p>
<p><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </span><br><br></p>
<p>In order to
develop and execute the Games, there may be times when TO2015™ has to collect
personal information which may include names, addresses, date of birth, phone
numbers and email addresses. This may be collected from you in a variety of
circumstances, such as when you purchase merchandise from us, enter into
contests, participate in surveys, join our social networking sites, apply for
paid or volunteer positions, or communicate online with our customer service
representatives. If you use our "email
this style to a friend" functionality, or if you choose to send an email from
our site to a friend, we will also collect your friend's name and email
address.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><em>What we collect</em>: We may
collect personal information through surveys, questionnaires, and other means.
In addition to name, address (postal and/or e-mail), telephone number, and
transaction/credit card information, we may collect demographic information
(i.e., age, gender, income, occupation, and education) and opinions of our
stakeholders. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and, if
so, shall treat that as personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>Modes of Collection</em>: TO2015™ collects personal
information about its stakeholders through various applications and order
forms, including credit applications, surveys and questionnaires, face-to-face
interactions, and our online properties. For certain transactions, we may
obtain personal information about a stakeholder from third parties, such as
consumer reporting agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>Personal Information of Children:</em>&nbsp;We
are committed to protecting the online privacy of children under the age of 18.
We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's use of the
internet. Where a child is providing us with personal information, it is the
responsibility of each parent or guardian to supervise them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </span><br><br></p>
<p>TO2015™ uses the
personal information we collect to provide stakeholders with news about the
Games, manage our business, sell merchandise and tickets, and comply with
regulatory and industry requirements. More specifically, we use personal
information to create and maintain vendor accounts, communicate with our stakeholders,
and supply stakeholders with information about the Games. We may also use
information about stakeholder interests and preferences, as well as feedback we
receive from surveys, to improve our delivery of the Games. TO2015™ makes all
reasonable efforts to ensure that information is used responsibly, and only for
its intended purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We
may provide your private information to a third party that administers any
facility, service or promotion operated via our website, <a href="http://www.toronto2015.org/">www.Toronto2015.org</a> (the “the Site”) on our behalf to enable such third party to administer
that facility, service or promotion properly. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>We
may use your personal information to operate the features of the Site and to allow
you, when you choose to do so, to participate in features available only to
registered users or interactive features of the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We
may from time to time operate online job or volunteer application systems. If
you submit such an application, we may process the information provided by you
for the purpose of considering the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When
you sign up to take part in a program or initiative that we may operate from
time to time, or to receive online and/or email communications (e.g. our
supporters’ or partners’ newsletters or business e-alerts) or text
communications (e.g. communications enabled via the Site between us and users
of mobile telephones or other portable devices), we may use the information
that you provide to maintain appropriate databases and otherwise to operate and
facilitate such programs, networks and</p>
<p> communications.</p>
<p>
The
data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a
destination outside Canada
for processing by staff operating outside Canada who work for us. If you
submit personal information, you specifically consent by doing so to such
transfer, storing or processing. We will endeavour to ensure that your data is
treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>To whom we
disclose your personal information</em>: Depending on
the nature of the information our stakeholders require, we may disclose
personal information to our funding partners, financial institutions, credit
reporting agencies, and third party service providers such as data processing
and marketing companies. In addition, if you have applied for any position, whether
paid or volunteer, with TO2015™, we will disclose your personal information to
agencies conducting security and background checks on our behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will disclose your personal
information if we reasonably believe that we are required to do so by law,
regulation, court order or any competent governmental, statutory or public
authority or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of
our stakeholders. We may also co-operate with law-enforcement agencies in any
official investigation, and we may disclose your private information to such
agencies in doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are bound by the provisions of
the <em>Freedom of Information and Privacy
Protection Act (Ontario)</em>
and the disclosure obligations set out therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>When we will get your consent</em>: We will request your express consent to the use and disclosure of
your personal information for specific types of transactions on the application
or other forms used in connection with those transactions. Where it is
reasonable to imply your consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information
in accordance with this Policy (e.g., in connection with a background check
following an application for accreditation), we may do so. Where it is
reasonable, we may also imply your consent to the use and disclosure of your
personal information in accordance with this Policy from continuing requests
for information now that you are knowledgeable about our personal information
practices. We will obtain your express consent before using or disclosing your
personal information for any purposes not identified in this Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIMITING THE
USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </span></p>
<p>Subject to
contractual and other legal obligations, you are entitled to withdraw your
consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information. Specifically,
if you prefer that we do not use or disclose your personal information for
marketing and promotional purposes, please notify our Privacy Officer. Please
note that your request may take three to four weeks to implement. We are
legally bound to inform you that withdrawing your consent may preclude us from
providing you with certain information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of
personal information obtained from third parties, we will work with stakeholders,
list owners, and other media owners to fulfill the right of clients to know of
the existence, use, and disclosure of their personal information and to provide
access to that information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note
that the Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our control
and are not covered by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you access other
websites using the links provided, the operators of those websites may collect
information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their
privacy policies, which may differ from ours. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECURITY
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>Once
we have received your private information, we will use reasonable commercial
efforts to protect it by using physical, managerial and technical procedures
and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access to it. We cannot,
however, guarantee the security of any personal information provided to us in
an email or in online form while it is being transmitted to us, as the internet
is a potentially non-secure method of information transfer. Any such
transmission is at your own risk. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">USE OF
COOKIES </span></p>
<p>Similar to other
commercial websites, our Site utilize a standard technology called
"cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our Site
is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include
the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Site, and the
websites visited just before and just after our Site. This information is
collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with
you as an individual. If you choose to correspond with us via e-mail, we may
retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address
and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic
communications that we employ in the maintenance of non-electronic information,
such as that received by mail and telephone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information
obtained through cookies on our Site is used for internal review, to improve
the content of our web pages, and to customize the content and/or layout of our
pages for each individual visitor; it is not shared with other organizations
for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web beacons are
small strings of code that are placed in a web page or in an email message.
They are sometimes called "clear GIFs" (Graphics Interchange Format)
or "pixel tags". Web beacons are most often used in conjunction with
cookies to track activity on our websites. When you visit a particular web
page, web beacons notify us of your visit. Since web beacons are used in
combination with cookies, if you disable cookies the web beacons will only detect
an anonymous website visit. When used in an email, Web beacons enable us to
know whether you have received the email. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACCURACY OF
PERSONAL INFORMATION </span></p>
<p>TO2015™ will try
to ensure that information about you is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. We
may update the personal information in our records from time-to-time, where
current information is required for the provision of a particular product or
service. Please inform us of any change of name, address, or other information.
Should you have questions about the accuracy of factual information we have
collected about you, you will have access to that information to verify and
update it. If we have disclosed inaccurate information about you to a third
party, we will be pleased to contact the third party in order to correct the
information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDIVIDUAL
ACCESS </span></p>
<p>If you have any
questions about the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information
by TO2015™, or if you simply want to know whether we have any of your personal
information on file, you may contact our Privacy Officer. TO2015™ will respond
to your requests for access in accordance with applicable privacy legislation.
In the event that we refuse access to you, we will provide you with the reasons
for our refusal upon request. Exceptions may include information that contains
references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for
legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons, and information that is
subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MISCELLANEOUS</span></p>
<p>Please
note that this Privacy Policy and any privacy notices displayed on the Site
("Privacy Documents") have been drawn up in the English language and
shall be interpreted in the English language. Where any of the Privacy
Documents (or any part of a Privacy Document) is translated into any language
in addition to English and there is any conflict in meaning between the
English-language version and the translated version, the English-language
version shall prevail in all respects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

may, from time-to-time, change the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your use of
our Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be
bound by the terms, as changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy
