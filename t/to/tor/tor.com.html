<h3><strong>TOR.COM PRIVACY AND COOKIE NOTICE</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Effective Date: July 17, 2018</strong></p>
<p>We at Tor.com (“we” or “us”) respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship we have with you. This Privacy and Cookie Notice applies to personal information we collect through any online interface (e.g., website, mobile application, or other interactive service) that contains a link to this Notice authorized by us (the “Site(s)”).

The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, and dates and times of visits to the Sites.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cookies and Online Tracking<br>
</span></strong>A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We use two kinds of cookies on the Sites: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser, they disappear. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they remain on your hard drive after you exit your browser. The cookies used on the Sites include those which are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies), remember your choices (functionality cookies), and cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising (described more below under “Interest-based Advertising”). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.</p>
<p>We may use the information we obtain from your use of our cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<ol style="line-height: 1.5">
<li>to recognize your computer when you visit the Sites;</li>
<li>to track you as you navigate the Sites, and to enable the use of any e-commerce facilities;</li>
<li>to improve the Sites’ usability;</li>
<li>to analyze the use of the Sites;</li>
<li>in the administration of the Sites; and</li>
<li>to personalize the Sites for you, including serving targeted advertisements which may be of particular interest to you both on and off the Sites.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also may use “web beacons” on our Sites. A web beacon, also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to our service providers’ servers. These web beacons are the technique by which our service providers compile information about your browsing activity on the Sites.</p>
<p><strong>Interest-based Advertising<br>
</strong>We may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. This section of our Privacy and Cookie Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.</p>
<p>You may see certain ads on other websites or in your emails based on your visits to our Sites and third-party sites because we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors, such as Google AdWords. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests, to track your browser across multiple websites, and to build a profile of your web browsing. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Some of our advertising and content partners that may access and use cookies and other data through our Sites are set out below with information about their privacy and opt-out practices. You can also delete and/or block specific cookies from your browser (as explained above):</p>

These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event of a prospective or completed merger, sale or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).
