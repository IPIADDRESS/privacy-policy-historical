        <h2 class="p">What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? </h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you are accessing the Website and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
        <h2 class="p">What Personal Information Does Company display or Collect? </h2>
