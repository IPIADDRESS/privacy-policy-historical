				<h2>8. Cookies</h2>
				<p>A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed on a user's computer hard drive by a website. There are several types of cookie and the most common are often referred to as 'session' cookies. These are used to keep track of information needed by a user as they travel from page to page within a website. These cookies have a short lifetime and expire within a few minutes of the user leaving the site.</p>
				<p>Other types of cookies can be used to track internet activity after the user has left a website. These are usually sponsored by organisations external to the website being visited and are generally known as 'third party' cookies. These usually have a long lifetime with several months being quite common. They are 'harvested' and 'refreshed' whenever the user visits a page where the same or a similar cookie is being used.</p>
				<p>TOPPS TILES uses benign, short lived 'session' cookies to tell whether a website user has logged, in, where to find details that can be used to pre-fill parts of on-line forms and to personalise the user's visit to the website. They are also used to track anonymously which areas of the site are popular and which are not used, this allows us to target carefully our website resources.</p>
				<p>TOPPS TILES also uses cookies in its email communications to personalise the email and track whether the mail has been opened or read and whether the recipient has used any website links contained in the email communication. This allows us to monitor and improve our email communications and website.</p>
				<p>Internet browsers normally accept cookies by default; however, it is possible to set a browser to reject cookies. If this is done it is important not to exclude the benign and useful session cookies. Choose an option that rejects all third party and long lived cookies.</p>

				<h2>9. Links to Third Party Websites </h2>
				<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the personal data collected by TOPPS TILES and does not apply to third party websites.</p>
				<p>TOPPS TILES is not responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites. TOPPS TILES advises users to read the privacy policies of other websites before registering any personal data.</p>

				<h2>10. Security</h2>
				<p>The TOPPS TILES website holds your personal data in accordance with the security provisions of UK data protection legislation.</p>
