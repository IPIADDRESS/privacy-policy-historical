You may request the Notice of Information-Sharing Disclosure by writing to us at. TOP10SUPPLEMENTS.COM, Marketing Department at Top10Supps.com, Attn: Privacy. &nbsp;We will respond to your request for a Notice of Information-Sharing Disclosure within 30 days.</p>
<p><b>Additional Information about Our Sites</b></p>
<p><b>Visiting Our Site </b>In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites.</p>
<p><b>Cookies and Tracer Tags </b>Our Sites use a technology called âcookiesâ. A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our Service Providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites.</p>
<p>We also use cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on other websites. Although you may not opt out of receiving online advertisements generally, you may control the collection of data on our site used for targeted TOP10SUPPLEMENTS.COM.com advertising during your visits to other websites. To opt-out of TOP10SUPPLEMENTS.COM.com data collection for targeted advertising on other sites, please contact us at Top10Supps@gmail.com</p>
<p>Tracer Tags: Our Sites may also use a technology called âtracer tagsâ. These may also be referred to as âClear GIFsâ or âWeb Beaconsâ. This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Sites. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Sites for you and other future website visitors.</p>
<p><b>Security of Personal Information </b>We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of Personal Information in our custody and control. We also are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our Sites. However, even with the best technology, no website is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures which we believe are appropriate to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and, where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer such information to take comparable steps to protect that security.</p>
<p><b>Secure Shopping </b>When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your Personal Information. Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites. The most recent versions of Netscape Navigatorâ¢ and Microsoft Internet ExplorerÂ® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively.</p>
<p><b>Passwords </b>To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your Personal Information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. TOP10SUPPLEMENTS.COM will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).</p>
<p><b>Our Privacy Statement and Outside Links </b>This Privacy Statement only applies to the various Sites. Our Sites may include links to the websites of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. These other sites are outside of our control. Please be aware that these websites may collect information about you, and operate according to their own privacy practices which may differ from those contained in our Privacy Statement. Remember to consult that websiteâs own privacy policy, as once you are outside any of the Sites, any information you submit is no longer in our control.</p>
<p><b>Privacy Statement Modifications </b>From time to time we may modify or amend this Privacy Statement in order to comply with new laws or regulations or to reflect future changes in our business practices. Any changes in our policies will be communicated in this page so please check back on occasion. We also may post a notice on our Sites or send an email describing the changes.</p>
<p><b>Contacting Us </b>If you have any questions about our handling of Personal Information, please contact us at TOP10SUPPLEMENTS.COM, Marketing Department at <a href="mailto:Top10Supps@gmail.com">Top10Supps@gmail.com</a> Attn: Privacy</p>
