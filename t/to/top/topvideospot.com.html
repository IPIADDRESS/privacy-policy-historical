</p><p>This Privacy Policy covers TVS's treatment of personal information that TVS gathers when you are on the TVS website and when you use TVS services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that STN does not own or control.
</p><p>
Sharing Your Information
TVS will not rent nor sell your personal information to any third party.
</p><p>
Information Collected by TVS

</p><p>

TVS receives and stores information you enter on our website.
</p><p>
Registration: In order for you to use some TVS services, such as submitting new media links to the website, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require personal information (including your full name, e-mail address, year of birth, and country of residence).
</p><p>

</p><p>
Automatic Information:
<br>
- TVS receives and stores certain information whenever you interact with us. TVS and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, TVS cookie information, and the page you requested. TVS uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.
<br>
- TVS may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. 
</p><p>
E-mail Communications<br>
TVS may send out e-mails with TVS-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from TVS, which inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, you will have the ability to opt-out by clicking on an unsubscribe link at the bottom of an email message. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.
</p><p>
Cookies<br>
Cookies enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. TVS cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.
<br>
- Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.
