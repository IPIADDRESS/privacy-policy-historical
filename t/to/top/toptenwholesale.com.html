		<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than stated in this Privacy Policy or for the purpose for which it was collected, we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>

		<p>JP Communications only shares Personal Information with other companies or individuals outside of JP Communications in the following limited circumstances:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>We may provide Member Information, such as your email address, to companies or individuals who may wish to contact you to offer their goods or services.  We do not provide credit card information, your user ID or any password to anyone outside of JP Communications.</p></li>

		<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of Aggregated, Non-personal Information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisers link or searched for a particular term, for example.  Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
		<p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.  If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year.</p>

		<p>We restrict access to Personal Information to JP Communications employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.

		<p>When you use JP Communications services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information that they want to access, correct or remove before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that we cannot authenticate, would jeopardize the privacy of others, would require us to access information that is not readily accessible or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>
		<h2>Enforcement:</h2>

		<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
