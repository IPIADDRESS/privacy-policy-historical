TOP40-CHARTS.COM PRIVACY STATEMENT <br>
<br>
This confirms that TOP40-CHARTS.COM  is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  This privacy statement discloses the 
privacy practices for http://top40-charts.com . <br>
<br>
TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users’ trust and confidence in the Internet by 
promoting the use of fair information practices.  Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, 
it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.  By 
displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of:<br>
<br>
1.   What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through 
the web site <br>
<br>
2.   The organization collecting the information <br>
<br>
3.   How the information is used <br>
<br>
4.   With whom the information may be shared <br>
<br>
5.   What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information <br>
<br>
6.   The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under 
TOP40-CHARTS.COM control <br>
<br>
7.   How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. <br>
<br>

satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org.  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with 
the Web site to resolve your concerns. <br>
 <br>
<b>Information Collection and Use</b> <br>
Company X is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to 
others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  Company X collects information from our users at several 
different points on our website.<br>
  <br>
<b>Registration</b><br>
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form.  During registration a user is required to 
give their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to contact the user about the 
services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information 
(such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a 
more personalized experience on our site.  <br>
<br>
<b>Order</b><br>
We request information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping 
address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes 
and to fill customer’s orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with 
the user. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no 
way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie 
simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than 
once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to 
this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to participate in any 
of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests 
of our users to enhance the experience on our site. <br>
<br>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control 
over these cookies. <br>
<br>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information 
for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
<b>Sharing</b><br>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal 
information that can identify any individual person. <br>
<br>
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. <br>
<br>
We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or 
other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. <br>
<br>
These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we TOP40-CHARTS.COM are not responsible for the privacy practices 
of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each 
and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information 
collected by this Web site. <br>
<!--<BR>
Newsletter<BR>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. <BR>
--><br>
<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or 
contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information 
requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, 
age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for 
purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. <br>
<!--<BR>
Tell-A-Friend<BR>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and 
email address.  [COMPANY X] will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  [COMPANY X] 
stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  The friend may contact [COMPANY X] at [INSERT 
URL] to request the removal of this information from their database. <BR>
--><br>
<b>Security</b><br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the 
website, your information is protected both online and off-line.  <br>
<br>
While we try to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  
All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only 
employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service 
representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected 
screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your 
information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as 
any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what 
they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable 
information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.  <br>
<br>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@thiswebsite.com. <br>
 <br>
<b>Site and Service Updates</b><br>
We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or 
phone. <br>
<br>
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, 
we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be 
done at the member information page. <br>
<br>
<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what 
information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use 
personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users 
by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will 
use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. <br>
