						<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
						<br>
							We hold only a minimal amount of information on each registered client.  In order to register, we only require an email address (and a password). Prior to sending any payments, we will also require a name and address.
							<br><br>
							We only hold information in order to allow users to log into and run their accounts.  We will also keep accounts updated with commission levels.  Registered users may update their account details online by following the relevant links from within their account page.  
							<br><br>
							<ul>
							<li>We may monitor traffic patterns in order to improve our services, to help monitor purchases and commissions and keep accounts up to date.</li>
							<li>We do not send Junk Email or Spam.  We may send emails with site updates or offers, but users will be able to specify the type of emails received.</li>
							<li>We do not pass users details on to third parties, unless specifically requested to do so by the users.</li>
							</ul>
							Users may request to see any information that we hold on them.  This may include purchase information, account totals, contact details and other information.  Users may request this information by using our ‘Contact Us’ form.  There may be a small administration fee for using this service, which will be no more than £10.
							<br><br>
							It is possible that we will wish to use customer information in unanticipated ways, not stated in our Privacy Policy.  In this event, we will contact individuals before using the data for new purposes, so that the individual users may opt-out if they wish.
							<br><br>
							We aim to be very flexible and transparent in the use of users details.  If users wish for their account to be deleted or amended in any way – or if they wish to prevent us from using their information for any purposes, either as initially stated or for any new purposes, then they may contact us using our ‘Contact Us’ form and we will endeavor to comply with their wishes.
							<br><br>
							If any user feels this site is not following its stated information policy, then they may inform us through our ‘Contact Us’ form.
							<br><br>
							<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
							We recommend that all users enable cookies in their browsers in order to make full use of the site and in order to ensure that any purchases on third party sites are recorded.  Cookies are small pieces of data or information that are stored by a users browser onto their hard-drive.  The information cannot be seen by any other websites (so the information is secure) and is used by us to provide features to aid the use of our services.  If users do not have cookies enabled, it is likely that third-party retailers will not record some of their purchases.
							<br><br>
							If a user can sign-in to our site, then they most likely have cookies enabled.  Users may also check if they have cookies enabled using our ‘Tracking Test’ page.
