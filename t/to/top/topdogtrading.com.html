<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br><strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing the products and services you requested, to process your payment, </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">, </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">to monitor the use of the service, </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">our marketing and promotional efforts</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> and </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">improve our content and service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, services</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> and for other lawful purposes.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. </span><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. </span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IP Addresses</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Sharing and Selling Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual address. </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br></span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site. <br style="mso-special-character: line-break"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.

Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. </span></p>

<p><em><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Our Commitment To Data Security:</span></b></em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Surveys &amp; Contests </span></b></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.
