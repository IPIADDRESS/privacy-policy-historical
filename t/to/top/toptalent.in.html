    <p>Thank you for visiting TopTalent.in job search and hiring management   Internet web site located at the URL www.toptalent.in. This Privacy   Policy details certain policies implemented throughout TopTalent.in   governing the use of personally identifiable information provided to   TopTalent.in via this Site or otherwise. By accepting the policy at the   time of registration, you expressly approve and consent to our   collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as   described in this Policy.</p>
    <p>Due to the rapidly evolving nature of Internet, TopTalent.in may need   to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, TopTalent.in   will post its updated Privacy Policy on its web site. TopTalent.in   encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.   Your continued use of this Site will be subject to the then-current   Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><u><strong>Personal Information</strong></u><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>In order to operate the Site in an efficient and effective manner and   provide users with information on job postings and services that may be   of interest to them, Toptalent may collect personal information,   including contact information (such as an email address), from its   users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users with   private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on   our site (e.g., jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain   information based upon your behavior on the Site and use this   information to do internal research on our users demographics,   interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in   general. This information may include the URL that a user has just come   from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), the URL a user goes to   next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), a user`s computer browser   information, and their IP address.</p>
    <p>You agree that TopTalent.in may use your personal information to   contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is   targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings and services),   or provides administrative notices or communications applicable to your   use of the Site. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree   to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these   communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt by   following the opt-out provisions provided in each such communication.</p>
    <p>We do not sell our user`s personal information to anyone for any   reason. All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily   display or distribute personal information (such as their email address   or resume), that information can be collected and used by others. This   may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which   TopTalent.in is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at this Site   by following a link from a TopTalent.in affiliate and the affiliate may   use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this   one.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>TopTalent.in may also disclose specific user information when we   determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to   cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the   interests or safety of Toptalent or other users of the Site. In   addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a   third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a   bankruptcy of TopTalent.in.</p>
    <p><strong><u>Credit Card Security</u></strong></p>
    <p>TopTalent.in employs encryption for secure credit card transactions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><u>About Cookies</u></strong></p>
    <p>At TopTalent.in, we use cookies only for the protection and   convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our   users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. If a user`s system is   idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie will expire, forcing the   user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents   unauthorized access to the user`s information while they are away from   their computer. You may have the ability to reset your browser to refuse   all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, some   Toptalent features or services may not function properly without   cookies.</p>
    <p>Third-Party Cookies: We may use third-party advertising companies to   serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use information   (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number)   about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide   advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would   like more information about this practice and to know your choices   about not having this information used by these companies, please send   us an email to the email ID mentioned at the end of this page.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><u>What You Should Know</u></strong></p>
    <p>TopTalent cannot ensure that all of your private communications and   other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise   described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we are committed   to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not   expect, that your personal information or private communications will   always remain private. As a user of the Site, you understand and agree   that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Site,   the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for   your conduct on and off the Site.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><u>Feedback &amp; Complaints</u></strong></p>
    <p>It is our constant endeavor to provide unique experience in Online   Recruitments. However, in the unlikely event of our services not meeting   your expectations, we would like to hear from you. For speedy   resolution of your complaints, it is important that your write to the   correct email address as explained below.</p>

If you ever   receive a request for this type of sensitive information, please do not   respond and immediately contact TopTalent customer service to report the   suspected fraud.</p>
