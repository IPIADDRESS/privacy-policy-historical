<div class="alert alert-info">This Tophatter privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through Tophatter. This includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.</div>
<h3>User Consent</h3>
<p>By accessing or otherwise using Tophatter, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

<h3>Regarding Children</h3>
<p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Tophatter and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information permanently from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent’s permission before submitting information over the internet. By using Tophatter, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have a parent’s or guardian’s permission to use Tophatter.</p>

When you win an auction or purchase an item, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information, which we may collect and store, so that our service providers can process your payment for the item.

<b>Personal Information from Other Sources</b>
<p>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.</p>

<b>Information Collected Via Technology</b>
<p>As you use Tophatter, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, type of device, operating system, and the address of the referring website. We may also place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, Flash Cookies, Silverlight Cookies, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications ("Cookies"). We use these technologies to: recognize you as a customer; customize Tophatter Services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; help ensure that your account security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent fraud; and to promote trust and safety across our site.  We use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. In order to use our Services offered through Tophatter, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of Tophatter may not work properly, and you may not be able to receive our Services. This type of information is collected to make Tophatter and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Tophatter to meet your special interests and needs</p>

You may opt out of this ad serving using the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Tophatter to assist with ad targeting.</p>
<p>We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Tophatter. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.</p>
<h3>Use and Disclosure of Information</h3>

Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network with which you have connected to Tophatter, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.</p>

Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service. We require our third-party service providers to agree not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us.
