            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><em>UPDATED: July 11, 2013</em></p>
<p>TopGolf International, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("TopGolf" or "we" or "our" or "us") are committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected from you, what we do with it and with whom we share it. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing any personal information at our physical locations ("Locations") or through this website at www.topgolf.com (this "Site").</p>
<p>Please note that the headings contained in this Privacy Policy are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not in any way define or affect the meaning, construction, or scope of any of the provisions contained in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AGREEMENT FOR THE SITE CAREFULLY. YOUR USE OF THE SITE SIGNIFIES YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect </strong></p>
<p>Information is collected about you, including without limitation, a person’s full name and address, telephone number and email address, as well as other information we maintain about a person in identifiable form, when you visit our Locations and voluntarily contact us through this Site, including without limitation information you provide on signup and membership registration pages, surveys, or other submission and/or purchases through this Site.</p>
<p><strong>How Information We Collect is Used</strong></p>
<p>The information collected may be combined with other information collected about you and is used and disclosed in a number of ways by us, to help us better understand and serve our customers, including without limitation the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide you with, or otherwise respond to your requests for, information and/or services, including but not limited to e-newsletters, marketing programs, forward-to-a-friend or other options in our marketing programs.</li>
<li>To provide you with information about new products or services, events at our Locations, events that TopGolf sponsors, including but not limited to contests, sweepstakes and surveys, and other special offers and marketing programs, which may include information about partner companies or other programs any of us or them are involved with.</li>
<li>To display a member’s first and last name on Leaderboards at a TopGolf facility as well as on any digital platform such as the Site or mobile app.</li>
<li>To enhance our customers' experiences at our Locations and on this Site.</li>
<li>To analyze customer behaviors and trends.</li>
<li>To conduct research and analysis and to otherwise measure the effectiveness of our online and offline marketing efforts and to develop products, services, and marketing programs.</li>
<li>To coordinate program activities and communications with other marketing programs conducted by us.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell or rent to third parties any of the personal information that you provide to us through this Site or at our Locations, or authorize any of our suppliers to sell or rent any such personal information, and we do not authorize any of our suppliers to make independent use of your personal information for their own purposes, including but not limited to direct marketing.&nbsp; However, aggregated information about customers utilizing this Site, in surveys or otherwise providing information to TopGolf may be utilized by TopGolf and/or suppliers in connection with research, benchmarking and other like uses.</p>
<p><strong>Site Usage Information </strong></p>
<p>Like most web sites, this Site gathers traffic patterns, site usage information and other aggregated data in order to evaluate our visitors' preferences and the effectiveness of this Site. This aggregate usage data does not identify you individually. We may share anonymous, aggregated statistics about visitors to this Site with third-parties, and we may allow third-parties to collect aggregate data through this Site and/or supplier sites accessible from or though this Site.</p>
<p>This Site may use cookies to enhance the browsing and usage experience on our Site. "Cookies" are small files or records that are placed on your computer's hard drive (by us or a third party provider of ours) to collect information about your activities on our Site. The information captured about your activities on our Site will make it possible for us (i) to speed navigation and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of certain of our marketing email campaigns; (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and banners served on our Site, and (v) enforce limitations on downloads described for on-line coupons and other similar offers. If you refuse cookies, your experience on our Site may be affected — for example you may not be able to utilize all of the functions on this Site.</p>
<p><strong>Contests/Sweepstakes</strong></p>
<p>On occasion, TopGolf may conduct or sponsor contests/sweepstakes with the opportunity to win prizes. Each contest/sweepstakes has its own terms and conditions ("Official Contest/Sweepstakes Rules"). As part of entering a contest or sweepstakes on-line through this Site or through a third party provider site, certain personally identifiable information (including but not limited to name, address, phone number, etc.) may be required. This information will be used as described in the applicable Official Contest/Sweepstakes Rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Our Community </strong></p>
<p>The law requires that we and our suppliers may be required to share your personal information and non-personal information pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or other like orders. If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the law. In addition, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we and our suppliers reserve the right to use and disclose your personal and non-personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, and/or violations of this Site's Terms and Conditions statement as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy </strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13) years.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Site is directed to persons who are at least thirteen (13) years of age. If a parent or guardian is made aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information through any point of contact, we ask to be contacted at the below address or email address and we will delete the information about the child referenced from our files.</p>
<p><strong>Security of Your Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>TopGolf requires that its suppliers take appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential. Although we can't guarantee that there will never be a security problem, we have in place appropriate security measures to carefully guard against the loss or misuse of the information collected on this Site and at our Locations.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in Our Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy from time to time — for example, by altering our policy on sharing personal information. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer of Assets or Business </strong></p>
<p>In the event of a transfer or sale of some or all of our business or assets, TopGolf may disclose your personal information to those involved in such a transfer or sale of business or assets.</p>
<p><strong>Changing Your Information </strong></p>
<p>Moved? Changed e-mail addresses? If you need to update or verify your personal information, please email <a href="mailto:update@topgolf.com">update@topgolf.com</a> or in writing at TopGolf, 9400 N Central Expressway (Suite 1616), Dallas TX 75231, ATTN: Marketing Resources. Upon request, TopGolf will remove your personal information from our active database as soon as reasonably possible, unless we need to retain information for dispute resolution, troubleshooting and other valid legal or business reasons. Please note that we will not remove your historical usage information.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites </strong></p>

TopGolf requires that its suppliers take steps to keep your personal information confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TopGolf assumes no responsibility for third-party web sites, including but not limited to the privacy practices of these third-party sites.
