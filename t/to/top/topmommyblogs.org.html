<h3 class="dot">WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Blog Nation's treatment of personal information that Blog Nation collects when you use or access the Blognation.com website (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) or when you use Blog Nation's services on the Site. As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a username which can be your name, email address, or other account number), and information about that individual or his or her activities when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of users, products, or services from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Blog Nation does not own or control, or to people that Blog Nation does not employ or manage.</p>
<h3 class="dot">WHAT INFORMATION BLOG NATION COLLECTS</h3>
<p>Blog Nation collects personal information when you directly provide it, such as when you register or claim your blog on the Site’s directories and maintain a profile associated with such blog.</p>
<p>Blog Nation also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website and your activity on the Site. Blog Nation may use log files, IP addresses, and browsing history and information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Some of this information may be shared with third parties. These third parties (except for the entity which "anonymizes the data") will only use or have access to the information in anonymized form.</p>
<p>Blog Nation may also collect certain information through the use of “cookies” and “pixel tags” as discussed below.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="dot">COOKIES AND PIXEL TAGS</h3>
<p>Like many other websites, certain information may be automatically collected from you through the use of "cookies" or "pixel tags." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie may be linked to personal information. Pixel tags (also known as clear gifs, web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site.&nbsp; Advertisers and other third parties may also place cookies, clear gifs or other devices on your computer to collect nonpersonal information.</p>
<p>Cookies and pixel tags may be used, among other things, to enhance the user experience, serve advertising targeted to your interests, to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and to gather information. For instance, by setting a cookie, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while accessing the Site. Cookies can also enable Blog Nation or third parties to track and target the interests of users to enhance the user experience.&nbsp; Nonpersonal information collected through cookies and pixel tags may be shared with and disclosed to third parties, who in turn may share and disclose such nonpersonal information. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies in third party ads or services, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the Service may not function properly.&nbsp; For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or services</p>
<h3 class="dot">LINKS TO WEBSITES</h3>
<p>The Site contains links to other websites. Blog Nation is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website to learn how such website collects and uses personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other personal information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you.

<h3 class="dot">INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
<p>Blog Nation may share your personal information, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on the Site or offline with us through a third-party advertising partner and its service providers such as Google Mail, Outlook, Mad Mimi, Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook, which will merge that information with information gathered from other sources in order to deliver to you advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our advertising partner will make the data we provide it anonymous and will only use the data in its anonymized form.

<p>Blog Nation may disclose any of your information (including personal information and browsing information, to the extent available) to law enforcement, in response to a subpoena, or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is lawfully authorized or required, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to respond to claims or to protect the rights, property or safety of Blog Nation, our users, our employees or the public.</p>
