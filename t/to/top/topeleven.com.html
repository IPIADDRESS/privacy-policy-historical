						<h2 style="text-align:center">Nordeus Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">Valid from 07 Jul 2017.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Nordeus Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><b>A quick summary:</b></p><b>
</b><p><b>1.	This document explains what information is collected regarding the Nordeus games and services.<br>
2.	It also explains how we use that information, where we store it and how we protect it.<br>
3.	We can share the information with partners for the purpose of providing the Nordeus Services.<br>
4.	We will not share your information for third party advertising purposes.<br>
5.	We explain your rights in relation to the information.</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains to you how your personal information is collected and stored and what happens to it regarding the Nordeus Services. Because we know legal wording is not much fun, we have included a short and informal summary of each section (but the full version is the legally binding one). If you have any queries you can contact us at support@nordeus.com. </p>
<p>We’d also like to remind you that our Nordeus User Agreement has more information about how we operate the <a href="http://www.topeleven.com/terms-facebook/" title="Terms of Use" target="_blank">Nordeus Services</a>.</p>
<h3>1.	WHO WE ARE AND WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY GOVERNS</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains the different kinds of information Nordeus can collect from you when you’re using the Nordeus Services. Legally, we cannot and will not collect personal information about children below 13 without parental/guardian involvement. We will comply with applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>We can change this Privacy Policy, but if we do we will put the changed version online and normally it will take effect 30 days afterwards. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions with regards to the changes. </p>
<p>1.1.	Who is Nordeus? We are Nordeus Limited, incorporated and registered in Ireland with company number 526421 having an address at Nordeus Limited, 3rd Floor, Kilmore House, Park Lane, Spencer Dock, Dublin 1, Ireland and its group of companies (“Nordeus”).</p>
<p>1.2.	Which services does this Privacy Policy apply to? This Privacy Policy applies to our video games including Spellsouls: Duel of Legends and Top Eleven, our websites (including but not limited to www.Nordeus.com), plus all other Nordeus products and services, including (but not limited to) user accounts, customer and technical support, official forums, wikis, blogs and social media services (we will just refer to “Nordeus Services” to cover all these things).</p>
<p>1.3.	What information does this Privacy Policy apply to? Specifically, this Privacy Policy governs personal information (or, in the USA, personally identifiable information) and non-personal information (or, in the USA, non-personally identifiable information), which we collect from you when you are using the Nordeus Services (“personal information” means information, which, on its own or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you).</p>
<p>1.4.	What about children? We recognise we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We do not and will not knowingly collect personal information from any child under the age of 13 without consent from their parent or guardian. If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned about the transfer of personal information about your child, please contact support@nordeus.com.</p>
<p>1.5.	Will we ever change this Privacy Policy? We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in our services or to reflect applicable laws. If we do, we will make the changed Privacy Policy available online, make reasonable efforts to notify you of this and update the “Last Updated” date. Once we change the Privacy Policy, it will become legally binding on you 30 days after we post it online. During that period, you are welcome to contact us if you have specific questions about the changes at support@nordeus.com. If you do not agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using all Nordeus Services: in order to make the Nordeus Services work properly we need to have everyone using them under the same rules instead of different people having different rules.  </p>
<p>1.6.	We respect your right to privacy and will only process personal information in accordance with applicable legislation in the EU, the USA and elsewhere. For personal information contained in this Privacy Policy which is used by Nordeus in connection with the Nordeus Services, Nordeus is the data controller under European Union data protection legislation.</p>
<h3>2.	WHAT INFORMATION IS COVERED?</h3>
<p>We may collect certain information when you use the Nordeus Services such as your name and email address (more information below). We do not receive or store your payment details. Please also read our Cookie Policy below.</p>
<p>2.1.	What information might we collect from you? When you sign up for, download, use or play the Nordeus Services then we will collect certain information from you. This information may include:</p>
<p>i.	Your name;<br>
ii.	Your date of birth;<br>
iii.	Your email address;<br>
iv.	Any user name used to identify yourself;<br>
v.	Details of your digital platform account;<br>
vi.	Any other information which you supply us via our services (including the content of messages sent using any chat / communications systems);<br>
vii.	Technical details about any device which you use to access our services, including: Internet and/or network connection (including IP address); any mobile device identifier; your operating system, browser type or other software; or your hardware or other technical details. This is technical data about our users and their actions and patterns which does not provide personal information;<br>
viii.	Details of your use of our services including, but not limited to: metrics information about when and how you use the services; traffic data; and your geographical location data;<br>
ix.	If/when we decide to deploy social networking features in any of the Nordeus Services, and if you link our services to a social networking account(s), then we may collect details about your use of social networking account(s) and our services). This may potentially include certain information from (for example) Facebook or other social networks (including access to your name, location, gender, birth date, email address, photo, profile URL and friends list as well as aggregated non-personal analytics data about our users) strictly in accordance with the social network(s)’ terms and conditions; and<br>
x.	Other information required in order to help you with any queries or support matters.<br>
Some of the information types referred to above may be collected on an aggregated or anonymised (e.g. hashed) basis, or we may use it or share it in an aggregated or anonymised way, for research or analysis into the way our services operate and are used.</p>
<p>2.2.	What about the storage of payment details? The processing and storage of payment details is a matter for the relevant platform and payment method/processor. Nordeus will not receive, process or store any of your payment details. This is because the payment transactions themselves are completed through the relevant platforms (e.g. Apple’s App Store or Google Play) via the personal email address you have associated with that platform account. If you make in-game purchases within the Nordeus Services, we are notified by the payment processor once a transaction takes place, but we will not receive any of your actual payment details. </p>
<p>2.3.	What about cookies? We also collect information about you via cookies. You can find out more about our use of cookies in our Cookie Policy below. The Cookie Policy forms part of this Privacy Policy.  </p>
<h3>3.	HOW IS INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM YOU?</h3>
<p>We will collect information ourselves or via third parties for appropriate matters.</p>
<p>How might we collect this information from you? Information may be collected or processed regarding you in the following ways: (a) information you give us via the Nordeus Services; (b) information given when you contact us or report a problem with the Nordeus Services; and (c) we may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you don’t have to respond to them. We may collect this information via the Nordeus Services or trusted third parties connected with us for optional things like surveys or polls.</p>
<h3>4.	WHERE IS YOUR INFORMATION STORED?</h3>
<p>We will store your information in the European Economic Area. We will do our best to keep this information secure. No information security system is perfect so please remember to be careful.</p>
<p>Where will your information be stored? The information we hold will be stored and processed in the European Economic Area. By submitting your personal information, you agree to such transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that this information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>All information we hold is stored on our secure servers (which we own or license from appropriate third parties). We use industry standard procedures and security standards to prevent unauthorised access to our servers, however no online service or website can be completely secure, so please protect the account information in your possession as well.</p>
<h3>5.	HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION STORED?</h3>
<p>We will use your information to run, maintain and improve the Nordeus Services as well as to communicate with you (e.g. with newsletters or emails).</p>
<p>Sometimes we may share anonymised, non-personal information like operating system types with partners in order to run our services.</p>
<p>5.1.	How might your information be used? Your information may be used in the following ways:</p>
<p>i.	To ensure that the Nordeus Services are presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device from which you access them;<br>
ii.	To provide you with marketing information, products or services that you request from us and which we feel may interest you – for example, we may send you newsletters or emails about the Nordeus Services (of course, it’s optional and we will ask you for permission first where required);<br>
iii.	To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and us;<br>
iv.	To allow you to participate in interactive features of the Nordeus Services when you choose to do so;<br>
v.	To notify you about changes to the Nordeus Services;<br>
vi.	To provide, maintain, protect and improve the Nordeus Services and to protect Nordeus and other Nordeus Services users;<br>
vii.	To provide you with player to play chat functionality and other communication systems (Nordeus reserves the right to monitor the content of any of your messages and prevent your use of any such chat or other communication systems for any reason);<br>
viii.	To comply with intellectual property protection obligations we have under applicable laws including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the E-Commerce Directive; and<br>
ix.	To assess the performance of the Nordeus Services.</p>
<p>5.2.	Will we ever share any of your information with other parties? We may share some aggregated and general non-personal information on user behaviour (e.g. sales per region) with our partners who work with us to provide the Nordeus Services to you (for example, with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend the Nordeus Services. We may also share non-personal information with data analysis services to help us run the Nordeus Services.</p>
<h3>6.	HOW YOU USE YOUR INFORMATION AND THIRD PARTIES?</h3>
<p>You have the option to share your own personal information with others parties, in which case it will be governed by those parties’ own privacy policies – make sure to take a look at them. </p>
<p>Please remember that any communications you have via the Nordeus Services may reveal details about you. Also, any information you post publicly will be publicly available to other people. We are not responsible for your use of any otherwise private personal information which you make available, or the activities of other users or other third parties to whom you give or make available your information or content. The Nordeus Services may, from time to time, contain or connect you with third party content or services. Our Privacy Policy does not extend to external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies.</p>
<h3>7.	OTHER MATTERS</h3>
<p>See below for a few miscellaneous data matters… </p>
<p>7.1.	Please be aware that we are subject to various laws and we may be required to release personal information in order to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements.</p>
<p>7.2.	In the unlikely event of a reorganisation or merger of Nordeus we may transfer personal information to an involved third party who will protect this to at least the same level as we do in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>8.	YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
<p>You have rights about how your personal information is used, which can vary depending on where you live. If you have any questions, please contact us at support@nordeus.com.</p>
<p>8.1.	Can you ask us to stop processing your personal information? You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can change your email settings to unsubscribe from email communications.</p>
<p>8.2.	Can you see what information we store for you? Depending on where you live, you may have additional privacy rights. For example, in the EU you have the right to access your personal information we possess; you may have the legal right to contact us to request that we delete your personal information from our system; and you may have the legal right to ask us to rectify/correct your personal information if appropriate. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honour your request, but we may decline requests that are unreasonably repetitive, are disproportionate or infringe the privacy of others. </p>
<p>8.3.	Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to: Nordeus Limited, 3rd Floor, Kilmore House, Park Lane, Spencer Dock, Dublin 1, Ireland. This same California law permits us to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information.  You may exercise that choice by contacting us at the address above.</p>
<p>8.4.	Who should you contact if you would like to exercise these rights? If you would like to exercise any of these rights or have any queries regarding them, please contact: support@nordeus.com.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Nordeus Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>We (meaning Nordeus Limited) use technologies in our video games including Spellsouls: Duel of Legends and Top Eleven, our websites (including but not limited to www.Nordeus.com), plus all other Nordeus products and services, including (but not limited to) user accounts, customer and technical support, official forums, wikis, blogs and social media services (which we’ll call the “Services”) to collect information that helps us improve your online experience.  We refer to these technologies, which include cookies, collectively as “cookies.”  This policy explains the different types of cookies used on the Services and how you can control them.<br>
We hope that this policy helps you understand and feel more confident about our use of cookies.  If you have any further queries, please contact us at support@nordeus.com.<br>
Please also see our Privacy Policy above and our <a href="http://www.topeleven.com/terms-facebook/" title="Terms of Use" target="_blank">User Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>1.	By accessing or using the Services you authorise us to collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyse usage of the Services; (ii) provide a more personalised experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We, and our third party service providers, may use server log files or web log files and tracking technologies to collect and analyse certain types of technical information, including but not limited to, cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, URLs, domain names, landing pages, game state, the date and time of usage of the Services, and other similar information.</p>
<p>2.	We may also use other technologies, including but not limited to, web bugs, tracking pixels and cookies. Web bugs allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an email was opened, while tracking pixels allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites. Cookies allow us to improve the quality of the Services, make recommendations, and make the Services easier to use for you. A cookie is a small text file recorded on your hard drive that identifies you as a unique user and contains certain information about your particular login session and/or your use of the Services. Please note that companies delivering advertisements within the Services may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>

<p>a.	These sites use Google Analytics including its Remarketing feature based on Display Advertising (www.google.com/analytics/) for online advertising and for website analytics purposes – meaning that we use them to see how many visitors come to our site, the pages that generate interest and the links that visitors most often click on (amongst other things). Google Analytics uses cookies – small text files that are placed on your computer that store certain limited information about you. The cookies we use do not enable any visitor to our site to be individually identified and will only be used for online advertising and website analytics purposes. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager.</p>
<p>b.	In addition, the sites mentioned above use cookies, flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about you. This enables us to tailor our service offering (including our sites) to provide you with products and services which are more relevant to your individual tastes. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our sites. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. You may change your website browser settings to reject cookies, although please note that if you do this it may impair the functionality of our sites. For further information about cookies, including how to refuse cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<p>5.	We may change this Cookie Policy at any time:  please take a look at the “LAST UPDATED” date at the top of this policy to see when it was last revised.  Any amendments to this Cookie Policy will come into effect a reasonable period of time after this “LAST UPDATED” date (normally we consider 30 days to be a reasonable time period) unless you contact us before that date to discuss or query any of the amendments.  </p>

Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
<h3>8. DISCLAIMER</h3>
<p>8.1. You expressly agree that the Services are provided on an “as is” basis without warranties of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control.

<h3>12. DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h3>
<p>If you are a California based user of the Services, please note that there is no consensus on how companies like ours should interpret “Do Not Track” signals in the context of recent amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act.
