<p>We are committed to protecting Your Information and providing You with a safe, efficient and customised experience. To this effect, We have created this Privacy Policy to let You know what Information We collect when You use the Services, why We collect this Information and how We use the collected Information.

<h3>1. ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY (the “Privacy Policy” or the “Policy”)</h3>
<p>1.1 This Policy represents an agreement between you (“<b>You</b>” or “<b>Your</b>”) and Nordeus Limited, 53 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, Ireland (“<b>Nordeus</b>”, “<b>We</b>”, “<b>Us</b>” or “<b>Our</b>”). This Policy sets out the ways that We use the personal information which we may gather in providing you with games, software, updates, add-ons (including virtual goods and virtual currency) and services that are offered to you by us as well as any Nordeus website which you access to avail of any of the above (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”). </p>
<p>1.2 References to Nordeus in these Terms shall include any Nordeus affiliates which shall include subsidiaries, parent companies and any other entities under common ownership.

You will also be subject to these third party terms and you should review them carefully. </p>
<p>1.4 Please note that if you follow a link to any third party website, We do not accept any responsibility or liability for such a website, its policies, nor do We endorse such websites.</p>
<h3>2. AGREEING TO THESE TERMS</h3>

<p>2.3. Where you access the Services through a third party platform (for example, Facebook) or where you download the Services as an app (for example, from the App Store), you will be subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of that third party platform and you should also review those terms carefully.</p>
<p>2.4. We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time and You shall be notified of any such amendment via the platform through which You access the Services and/or by Us publishing the modified Privacy Policy on any platform through which You access the Services. We recommend that You revisit this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. For the avoidance of doubt, Your continued use of the Services shall be interpreted as deemed acceptance of any modifications to the Privacy Policy.</p>

We may collect, store and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy certain Information where You provide such Information either (i) directly to Us; or (ii) through Your use of a third party platform, which may, upon Your acceptance, provide this Information to Us through its application programming interface. We may also receive Information from Our third party service providers. We will have access to any Information You provide to such third party service providers, and We will use that Information to provide you with the Services and as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>3.4. By accessing or using the Services via Your mobile phone, or other mobile device, You are authorising Us to collect its identifier and IP address.

<p>3.5. We receive and store the information that You provide, including Your telephone number, when You sign up to have SMS notifications sent directly to Your mobile phone.

<p>3.7. Should You purchase a licence to use Virtual Items through a third party platform, and that purchase is processed by a third party (e.g. Apple Inc. where You have made a purchase on an iOS device), We may receive payment information which You provide to that third party but only in order to allow us to provide you with the licence to use Virtual Items. Any purchases which You make through a third party in this manner may be subject to their policies and it is Your sole responsibility to ensure Your compliance with those policies. We do not collect, nor do we have access to any of your billing or credit information. That data is collected and stored by third party payment service providers (for example, the platform through which you are accessing the Services).</p>
<p>3.8. We may collect this data through Our Services or third party services connected with them (including in particular Facebook and Google Analytics).</p>

<p>4.5.

<p>4.6. We may further provide Your Information to any third parties and data processors providing services to Us, including but not limited to, payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist Us in our marketing efforts.

<h3>5. COOKIES AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
<p>5.1. By accessing or using the Services You authorise Us to collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyse usage of the Services; (ii) provide a more personalised experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We, and our third party service providers, may use server log files or web log files and tracking technologies to collect and analyse certain types of technical information, including but not limited to, cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, URLs, domain names, landing pages, game state, the date and time of usage of the Service, and other similar information.</p>
<p>5.2. We may also use other technologies, including but not limited to, web bugs, tracking pixels and cookies. Web bugs allow Us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an email was opened, while tracking pixels allow Us to advertise more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to You on other websites. Cookies allow Us to improve the quality of the Services, make recommendations, and make the Services easier to use for You. A cookie is a small text file recorded on Your hard drive that identifies You as a unique user and contains certain information about Your particular login session and/or Your use of the Services. Please note that companies delivering advertisements within the Services may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>
<p>5.3. In the case the websites <a href="http://www.topeleven.com" target="_blank">www.topeleven.com</a> and <a href="http://www.nordeus.com" target="_blank">www.nordeus.com</a>:</p>
<p>(i) These sites uses Google Analytics including its Remarketing feature based on Display Advertising (www.google.com/analytics/) for online advertising and for website analytics purposes – meaning that We use them to see how many visitors come to Our Site, the pages that generate interest and the links that visitors most often click on (amongst other things). Google Analytics uses cookies – small text files that are placed on your computer that store certain limited information about you. The cookies we use do not enable any visitor to Our Site to be individually identified and will only be used for online advertising and website analytics purposes. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager.</p>
<p>(ii) In addition, the sites mentioned above use cookies, flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about you. This enables Us to tailor Our service offering (including Our Site) to provide you with products and services which are more relevant to your individual tastes. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to Our Site. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. You may change your website browser settings to reject cookies, although please note that if you do this it may impair the functionality of Our Site. For further information about cookies, including how to refuse cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<h3>6. PROTECTION OF MINORS</h3>
<p>6.1. The Services provided by Nordeus (including the game Top Eleven) may only be played by a person over the age of 16 or a person between the age of 13 and 16 where that person’s parent or guardian has reviewed and consents to the Terms and this Policy on their behalf. Any person who provides Information to Nordeus through any part of the Services represents to Nordeus that they are 16 years of age or older or that they are between 13 years of age and 16 years of age and their parent or guardian has reviewed the Terms and this Policy and has consented on their behalf. </p>
<h3>7. SAFETY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>7.1. Data encryption: To protect Your Information during communication with Your web browser, We encrypt transmissions of that Information using secure socket layer technology.</p>
<p>7.2. Further technical security measures: In order to prevent illegal manipulation by third parties and to identify and prevent any form of misuse, We record the IP addresses of all computers used to access the line-up on the Services. In addition, all Your Information are protected from unauthorised access by a firewall (a computer that is fitted with complex security technology specifically designed to shield Our network from the internet). Additionally, We use reliable internal data protection mechanisms combined with a restrictive security system. However, no website or internet transmission is completely secure, and We cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We thus urge You to take steps to keep Your Information safe, and to log out of your platform account after use. If your platform account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorised use of the Services, so be careful to keep your account information secure.</p>
<p>7.3. Although We strive to protect Your Information, We cannot guarantee the security of Your Information while it is being transmitted to Us; any transmission is at Your own risk. Once We have received Your Information, We have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<h3>8. DISCLAIMER</h3>
<p>8.1. You expressly agree that the Services are provided on an “as is” basis without warranties of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of Our technology and business, We cannot guarantee, nor do We represent, that there will be an error-free performance regarding the privacy of Your Information, and We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to the use or release of Your Information.</p>
<p>8.2. We cannot ensure the protection of any Information that You provide to a third party websites that links to or from the Services, since these third party websites are owned and operated independently of Us. Any Information collected by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy, if any, of such third party. If You have questions about a third party’s information practices, please read its privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of such third parties, and We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such online sites.</p>
<h3>9. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>9.1. Your Information collected by Us may be stored and processed in any country in which We or Our affiliates, suppliers, ESPs or agents maintain facilities. By using the Service, You expressly consent to any transfer of Information outside of Your country (including to third countries outside the EEA that may not have been assessed as having adequate privacy laws). Nevertheless, We take steps to ensure that Our agents, affiliates and suppliers comply with Our standards of privacy regardless of their location.</p>
<h3>10. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER</h3>
<p>10.1. If We should ever file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, or be acquired by a third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of Our assets, or transfer substantially all or part of Our relevant assets to a third party, We are entitled to share Your Information You have provided through the Services to potential and subsequent business and merger partners. By agreeing to the Terms of Service, You hereby give Your consent to such transfer of this Information.</p>
<h3>11. YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
<p>11.1. The following applies only to the processing of Your personal data by Nordeus in the provision of the Services:</p>
<p>(i) You have the right to ask Us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes (opt-out). We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes. You can exercise this right by contacting Our Helpcenter at <a href="http://support.nordeus.eu/home" target="_blank">support.nordeus.eu/home</a>.</p>
<p>(ii) You can contact Our Helpcenter at <a href="http://support.nordeus.eu/home" target="_blank">support.nordeus.eu/home</a> to request that We provide you with access to your personal information or that We update or delete your personal information from Our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honour your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records if required to do so by law or for legitimate business purposes (for example, where deletion of your personal data from our database may severely disrupt or disable your use of Services).</p>
