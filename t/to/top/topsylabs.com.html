</strong></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE</strong>:</p>
<p>We’re updating our Privacy Policy to highlight our new collaboration with Apple Inc. Our new Privacy Policy is effective November 26, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected prior to November 26, 2013, please click <a href="http://about.topsy.com/privacy-policy-previous" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TOPSY PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Topsy Labs, Inc. (“Topsy”) cares about privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose personal information.&nbsp; We may collect personal information you provide to us on www.topsy.com or other sites where this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the “<strong>Sites</strong>”). Topsy may also collect personal information that is publically available on third party sites and then make that data searchable on the Sites (the “<strong>Services</strong>”).&nbsp; By using the Sites or the Services provided, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information COLLECTED</strong></p>
<p>“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your first and last name or email address. We receive this Personal Information when you provide it directly to us on our Sites.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">In addition, Topsy may also collect information about you, some of which may constitute Personal Information that you have made publically available on third party sites (“Public Information”). If you do not want Public Information about you included in the Services, we recommend that you adjust the privacy settings of any third party site you use. You may also contact Topsy via email at </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="mailto:support@topsy.com">support@topsy.com</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> to request that Topsy delete Personal Information about you. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.</span></p>
<p><strong>USE of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Topsy may use Personal Information you provide directly to us to respond to your inquiries, notify you of important changes to our Services and fulfill your requests.&nbsp; We use Public Information to provide an index of the public social web and to improve our product offerings and Services.&nbsp; This allows users of our Sites and Services to view data aggregated across social networking sites, analyze trends on various topics and identify key thoughts, opinions and content over time or in real time. &nbsp; All data, including Personal Information, is processed by Topsy on servers located in the United States.</span></p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Topsy may share Personal Information with third parties who provide Topsy with services such as website hosting, data analysis, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, and auditing.&nbsp; These companies are obligated to protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Topsy may share Public Information that contains Personal Information with users of the Services.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Topsy may share Personal Information with a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, or assets (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</span></p>
<p>Topsy may share Personal Information or Public Information that contains Personal Information with its parent, Apple Inc.&nbsp; Apple will treat such information in compliance with the Apple Privacy Policy.&nbsp; In no event will Apple combine the personal information it has about an individual with any Personal Information collected by Topsy about that same individual without first obtaining his or her consent.</p>
<p>Topsy will also disclose information as it deems necessary or appropriate: (i) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (ii) to comply with legal process or respond to exigent circumstances; (iii) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (iv) to enforce the Topsy terms and conditions; (v)&nbsp;to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (vi) to protect Topsy and its customers’ rights, privacy, safety or property; and (vii) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">OTHER Information</span></strong></p>
<p>We and our third party service providers may also collect and use information not tied to any Personal Information that does not identify you as an individual.&nbsp; Such information includes browser and device information, demographic data and aggregated data as well as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Data about your access or use of Services:&nbsp; When you access or use our Services, we and our service providers may track, collect, and process usage data, such as your search queries, web pages that you requested, your activity on the Services, and errors you have encountered.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>〈 Cookies and other Technologies:&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.&nbsp; Cookies allow us and our service providers to collect information such as browser type, session information, time spent on the Services, pages visited, and anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for internal purposes such as security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services.&nbsp; We also gather statistical information about the use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and to assist us with resolving questions regarding them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies.&nbsp; If you do not accept cookies, however, you may be unable to take advantage of some of the features of our Services.</p>
<ul>
<li>〈 IP Address:&nbsp; Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned by your Internet Service Provider to the computer that you are using.&nbsp; An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.&nbsp; Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.&nbsp; We use IP Addresses for internal purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.&nbsp; Log files containing IP addresses will be retained for a maximum of one year and then deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may use and disclose the information described above for any purpose, except where prohibited by law. If we combine this data with Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTY SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link.&nbsp; The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.&nbsp; We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of such third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Topsy takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard Personal Information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<p><strong>use by MINORS</strong></p>
<p>The Topsy Sites and Services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and children under 13 may not submit Personal Information through the Sites or Services. If we learn that we have collected the Personal Information of a child under 13 we will delete the information as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>
<p>Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) features.&nbsp; We interpret the DNT feature to apply to third party tracking on a website.&nbsp; Since we do not allow third parties to track users on our Sites, we take no action when we receive a DNT signal.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; The “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page indicates when it was last revised.&nbsp; Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services.&nbsp; If we make material changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you via e-mail or by posting an announcement on this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>CONTACTING US</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@topsy.com.</p>
