                    Our websites use the third-party Cloudflare network to mitigate the security risks for our users during cyber-attacks.
                    Cloudflare processes online identifiers such as your IP address to help identify malicious visitors to our websites and to
                    reduce the chance of legitimate users from being blocked from accessing our websites.

                            We log the <b>search queries</b> that you make on our sites to help us to detect and prevent
                            malicious activity against our sites. The logs are deleted within two months.

                            We have <b>discontinued</b> email newsletter sign-ups and have deleted our mailing list of email addresses that users
                            had previously provided to us. We have decided to take this action since GDPR would require us to implement a complex
                            system of parental consent and proof of age, since many of our users are under 13 years old. If you wish to keep up to date

                    channels where we are present has a privacy policy, which we take care to adhere to, particularly with regard to sharing
                    potentially sensitive information and images featuring children's faces. We are keen that our sites and social media channels should
                    be as safe as possible for users. For more information you can review the privacy policies of

                <p>
                    For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the apps referred to include the standalone software applications for mobiles, tablets
                    and desktop devices, as featured on our <a href="/apps">apps pages</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Topmarks <b>does not</b> collect or share any personal data about you via our apps. All pupil data is stored locally on your
                    device so only you have access to the profile information. Our apps have no adverts, no in-app purchases or external links.

                <p>
                    When you purchase our apps you are entering into an agreement with the app store (e.g. Apple iTunes, Google Play or Amazon)
                    from which you purchase the app, rather than Topmarks. Be sure to check the privacy policy of the respective app store. 
                    We do not collect or use any personal data or payment details associated with your transactions with the app stores.
                    The app stores share with us anonymised, aggregated data on the number of apps sold, basic download and session information,
                    if you have opted-in to allow the respective app store to collect this data.

                <p>
                    When you email us or contact us on our websites with questions or support requests, you provide
                    your name and email address, as well as details of your query. This data is emailed to us and we use it only to deal 
                    with your specific query, after which time your details are deleted. We do not share the personal data that
                    you provide with any third parties.

                <h2>Protecting your information</h2>
                
                <p>
                    We take steps to protect your personal information from unauthorised access using generally accepted security measures.
                    The measures and safeguards include limiting access to the data to those persons who need it to complete their work for Topmarks,
                    encrypting web traffic and emails which may include personal data using Transport Layer Security (TLS), using firewalls and
                    anti-virus software to protect computer systems, and storing personal information in secure operating environments. That said,
                    Topmarks cannot and does not guarantee and does not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
