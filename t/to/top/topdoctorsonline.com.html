            d. Consulting<br>
            TopDoctorsOnline.com may partner with another party to provide specific services. When You sign up for these services, TopDoctorsOnline.com will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. Per TopDoctorsOnline.com's contractual arrangements with parties, these parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the explicit purpose of providing these services.<br>
            Medisurge Technologies hosts its own site (www.TopDoctorsOnline.com) as well as sites for Medisurge Technologies partners (typically some variation of www.TopDoctorsOnline.com///partners). Medisurge Technologies uses a similar registration process for users at our partner sites, and only Medisurge Technologies stores personally identifiable information collected at these sites. Any questions arising from collection of information through the Medisurge Technologies service at our partner sites should be directed to service@TopDoctorsOnline.com.<br>
            <br>
            e. Services through the Site <br>
            You provide us with information during the process of using the Medisurge Technologies service. We break down users of our service into two categories, Clients and Experts (you may register as both a Client and an Expert). Clients must provide financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date in order to pay for and use the Medisurge Technologies service. Experts must provide contact information, like name and mailing address, in order to receive their payment from Medisurge Technologies. The information we collect from both Clients and Experts is to provide users with the best possible Medisurge Technologies service. If we have trouble providing that service, we may use contact information to get in touch with the user.<br>
            <br>
            f. Member Client-Expert Communication Using the Medisurge Technologies Service<br>
            The main purpose of Medisurge Technologies is to allow registered Medisurge Technologies Experts to provide Clients with services that the Clients need. Experts and Members can negotiate and enter into a contract for a service using the Medisurge Technologies site. Certain communications may be recorded and maintained by Medisurge Technologies. Medisurge Technologies does not screen or edit the content of communications between Clients and Experts. Such communications are personal and private unless both parties agree to additional distribution. Information that is relayed between the Client and the Expert during either the negotiation phase of their relationship or during the actual relaying of service is kept completely confidential, and no other users of Medisurge Technologies have access to this information.<br>
            <br>
            g. Publicly Accessible Information<br>
            Medisurge Technologies makes Public Boards (e.g. Q&amp;A etc.) available to its registered users. The Public Boards allows members to post questions etc. that can be viewed by any Expert. All postings, descriptions, etc. are public to registered members and Experts. Medisurge Technologies clearly denotes to its users which communications are visible to all registered users and those that are visible to a specific, individual user only.</p></td>
