    <h1>Privacy and Cookies Policy</h1>
<p>Any words in capitals and/or defined in the Toasted Balls <u><a href="http://www.toastedballs.com/terms">Terms of Services</a></u> of which this Privacy and CookiesPolicy forms part shall have the same meaning as the one given to them in the said Terms of Services.</p>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, the Company may change this Privacy and Cookies Policy from time to time, and in the Company's sole discretion. The Company encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to this Privacy and Cookies. Your use of the Site after any change in this Privacy and Cookies Policy will constitute Your acceptance of such change.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy and Cookies Policy or the Site in general, please <a href="http://www.toastedballs.com/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The Company takes your privacy very seriously and is committed to being transparent with how it uses Your information.</p>
<p>This privacy policy, which has been adapted from a policy originally provided by <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> (<a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>) under a    <u><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Share-Alike License</a></u>, describes how the Company treats the information it collects when You visit and use the Site. Please read this notice very carefully.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, the Company collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Company's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the Site's visitors, users and/or subscribers (generically referred to in this Privacy and Cookies Policy as "visitor" or "visitors")use the Site. From time to time, the Company may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>The Company also collects Personal Data (Personal Data, Data Controller and Data Processor shall have the same meaning as in the Spanish Organic Law 15/1999, on Personal Data Protection - the Data Protection Law-) such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the Site. The Company only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses Personal Data as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personal Data</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to the Site choose to interact with the Site in ways that require the Company to gather Personal Data from them in which case the Company will be deemed as being the Data Controller of such Personal Data. The amount and type of information that the Company gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors who sign up at <u><a href="http://www.toastedballs.com/">the Site</a></u> are asked to provide a username and email address. In each case, the Company collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with the Site and/or the Company. The Company does not disclose Personal Data other than as described below and visitors can always refuse to supply Personal Data, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities or from using the Services.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>The Company may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Site. For instance, the Company may monitor the most popular collections on the Site. The Company may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, the Company does not disclose Personal Data other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Personal Data</h3>
<p>The Company discloses Personal Data only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it (as Data Processor) on the Company's behalf or to provide services available at the Site, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

The Company primarily uses its various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so it is expected that this type of email will be kept to a minimum. If You send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users but no Personal Data will be disclosed along such publication. The Company takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of Personal Data.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If the Company, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that the Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of the Company may continue to use Your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.</p>

It does not apply to the practices of companies that the Company does not own or control, or employees that the Company does not manage. The Site may contain links to third party websites. Any information You provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any.
