<b>Security</b><br>
We are committed to taking actions to help ensure your information is secure. While no method is 100 percent secure, in order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure we have put in place what we believe are suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to Our Websites. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on Our Websites.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. If we have given you (or where you have chosen) a username and password for access to certain parts of Our Websites, you are responsible for keeping these credentials confidential.

<br><br>
<b>How we use cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a small file which Our Websites you visit may place on your computer's hard drive. When the file is added, the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets us know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about webpage traffic and improve Our Websites in order to tailor Our Websites to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better experience when you are using any of Our Websites, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us or as described here. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

<br><br>
<b>Do Not Track</b><br>
Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a �do not track� setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This is different form disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the �do not track� setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. We do not respond to web browser �do not track� signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. Our Websites may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave Our Websites, you should note that we do not have any control over the content of other websites. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy policy applicable to the website in question.<br>
