        <h3 class="title">TJX Rewards Privacy Notice</h3>  
        <p>Effective date:  March 2014</p>
        <p>Welcome to the TJX Rewards™ website (the “Website”), which is operated by The TJX Companies, Inc. (“TJX”).  TJX, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Sierra Trading Post, Derailed, and other affiliates are the “TJX Businesses.”  This Privacy Notice applies to personal information TJX collects from Rewards members and users on the Website, in our stores and through other means.
</p>  
        <h4 class="subheader">Information We Collect</h4>

        <p>We may collect certain personal information from you in connection with your activities with TJX Rewards™, such as when you sign up to become a member or participate in promotions in our stores or online. This information may include: </p>

        <ul style="position:relative;left:30px;">
            <li>contact information (including name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone number);<br><br> </li>
            <li>date of birth;<br><br></li>
            <li>shopping history;<br><br></li>
            <li>other personal information you provide to us on our Website, on feedback forms,  in our stores, when you use your card or when you interact with us in other ways, both online and offline. <br> </li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Additionally, we or companies acting on our behalf may collect certain computer and browser information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons when you visit our Website (whether or not you have signed in as a register user) or otherwise interact with us online. A “cookie” is a file that a website sends to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.</p>
        <p>The information collected using these tools may include your IP address, the address of the web page that referred you to our Website, dates and times of Website visits and the location of your device. These automated technologies also permit the collection of “clickstream data,” which may include a log of content you access while browsing a website.  Companies acting on our behalf may combine the information collected from your visit to our Website with other information they have collected previously. 
</p>
        <h4 class="subheader">Opt-Out From and/or Restrict Cookies</h4>
        <p>Your web browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict, reject or disable certain cookies (but please note that we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals from web browsers). Additionally, you may opt-out of data collection from the particular companies that we use to collect information from users of our Website.</p>
        <ul style="position:relative;left:30px;">
            <li>We use a company called Adobe to collect and analyze information about the use of our Website.  To learn more about Adobe’s collection and analysis of information by automated means, including how to opt out, click <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html" target="_blank" title="Adobe Analytics Privacy Notice">here</a>.</li>

        <h4 class="subheader">Information We Share</h4>

We do not control other sponsors' use of your personal information, and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to participate in such jointly sponsored contests, sweepstakes or promotions. Such offerings may also be subject to additional rules and regulations governing your participation.</p>
        <p>We may also share certain personal information we collect about you with partners or third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. For example, we may use third parties to host our Website, operate certain of its features, send e-mails, print or send mailings, run our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, conduct customer research, authorize and process your payments, manage and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness, and fulfill orders. Such third-party service providers are given the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for their own or any others' marketing purposes. </p>
        <p>When you apply for the TJX Rewards™ Card, we share the information you provide with the financial institution that issues the card, and it is that institution’s privacy policy that applies to the information you provide on the TJX Rewards™ Card application.
