	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>At  Typing Agent, (located in Edmonds, WA 98020) we are acutely aware of the trust  you place in us and our responsibility to protect your and your students’  privacy. We keep all user and account information, including free trial  registrants and licensed users, strictly private and confidential. We only use  the information we collect to process orders and to provide product technical  support.</p>
<p>Your  email address will serve as your login username. Your email address may be used  to send a confirmation email at registration, as well as information and  updates to the programs. We may use the email address as an additional means of  communicating with you about the Programs and Typing Agent, including notifying  you of updates to the Web Site or its related policies.</p>
<p>If  you choose to provide us with personal information by ordering our products,  sending an email, or by filling out a form with your personal information and  submitting it through our Web site, we use that information to fulfill your  order, respond to your message or to help us provide you with information or  material that you request.</p>
<p>Typing  Agent will not sell, trade, rent or publish customer data to any advertisers,  or third parties, other than for purposes of processing a transaction and  providing direct product support for Typing Agent and its subsidiaries. Student  data, most specifically is not used, accessed, or shared with any third party  and is kept strictly confidential by Typing Agent LLC.</p>
<p><strong>Details of Transactions:</strong><br>All payment details you provide during online transactions are processed by a secure third party and transaction details are NOT retained or kept on our secure servers.</p><br>

<p><strong>How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong><br>Any customer information received by Typing Agent directly, from its authorized resellers or from its online registration service providers (see below) is hosted on a secured server. Firewalls, passwords, and encryption technology protect the information about our customers that we collect and securely store.</p>

<p>Typing Agent may release customer information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our member agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Typing Agent our customers or others. We will not send you unsolicited third-party promotional emails.</p>

<p>Except for the circumstances set forth in the previous paragraph, we will not knowingly distribute customer information to be used in mailing lists, surveys, or any other purpose other than what is required to perform our services.</p>

<p><strong>How does Typing Agent Protect Student Data:</strong><br>Student information collected is limited to what is required for the teachers to identify the students in their class. This includes: username, password, name and grade. Only this information is stored securely online for students. Furthermore, Typing Agent understands the importance of protecting student data and information. Personal student information is NOT required to be able to use the Typing Agent program. In light of this, the only parties that have access to student information will be: District Administrators, Teachers and Typing Agent support and their respective resellers and this is strictly limited to customer or technical support purposes only.</p>
<p>In  the event of an unauthorized disclosure of a student’s records, Typing Agent  will report to the master account holder of the affected school or district in  an app communication and email as to the depth and breadth of the data breach  and provide messaging that can be shared with the parents of legal guardians of  the students.</p>
<p>In  addition, following a one year period of time after a school or districts  account expires, student identifying records will be deleted from our database  archives and no longer available for use by Typing Agent. For reporting  purposes, an overview report of the school or districts progress (excluding  student identifying data) will be retained for analytical purposes. Prior to  this one year period and during the duration of the Typing Agent subscription,  students, parents, teachers, and administrators can print a report of an  overview of the work that the student accomplished while on the program.</p>
<p>Please  note: student passwords are visible to teachers and administrators of the  program. Best practice is NOT to have students use common passwords or  passwords they use elsewhere.</p>
<p>Typing  Agent shall take actions to ensure the security and confidentiality of all  students, including but not limited to designating and training responsible  individuals on ensuring the security and confidentiality of student records, by  securely storing student data behind a 256 Bit secure SSL certificate. Schools  and districts have control over how they would prefer to identify their  students within the Typing Agent program. In addition, only Typing Agent  support staff, teachers or school administrators have access to student  records. The minimal student identification information that is required to use  Typing Agent, is a username. Personal student contact information is NOT  required to be able to use the Typing Agent program. Typing Agent does allow  schools or districts to enable third party single sign on applications. Schools  and Districts who elect to do this are responsible for managing their student  privacy relationship with those third party entities.</p>
<p>Parents,  legal guardians, or eligible may review personally identifiable information in  the student’s records and correct erroneous information by contacting their  teacher or school administrators directly.</p>
