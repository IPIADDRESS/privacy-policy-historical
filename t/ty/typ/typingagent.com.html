	<h1>Typing Agent&nbsp;LLC Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>At Typing Agent, we are acutely aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to protect your privacy. We keep all user and account information collected strictly private and confidential. We only use the information we collect to process orders and to provide technical support.<br>
<br>
Your email address will serve as your login username. Your email address may be used to send a confirmation email at registration, as well as information and updates to the Programs. We may use the email address as an additional means of communicating with you about the Programs and Typing Agent, including notifying you of updates to the Web Site or its related policies.<br>
<br>
If you choose to provide us with personal information by ordering our products, sending an email, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our Web site, we use that information to fulfill your order, respond to your message or to help us provide you with information or material that you request.<br>
<br>
Typing Agent will not sell, trade, rent or publish customer or student data to any third party.<br>
<br>
<strong>Details of Transactions:</strong><br>
<br>
All of the payment details you provide during online transactions are processed by a third party and none of these details are kept on our servers.<br>
<br>
<strong>How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong><br>
<br>
Any customer information received by Typing Agent directly, from its authorized resellers or from its online registration service providers (see below) is hosted on a secured server. Firewalls, passwords, and encryption technology protect the information about our customers that we collect and store.<br>
<br>
Typing Agent may release customer information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our member agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Typing Agent our customers or others. We will not send you unsolicited third-party promotional emails.<br>
<br>
Except for the circumstances set forth in the previous paragraph, we will not knowingly distribute customer information to be used in mailing lists, surveys, or any other purpose other than what is required to perform our services.<br>
<br>
<strong>How does Typing Agent Protect Student Data:</strong><br>
<br>
Student information collected is limited to what is required for the teachers to identify the students in their class. This includes: username, password, name and grade. Only this information is stored online for students. Just like our customer data, Typing Agent understands the importance of protecting student data and information. In light of this the only parties that have access to student information will be: District Administrators, Teachers and Typing Agent support and their respective Resellers and this is strictly limited to customer or technical support purposes only. Please note: student passwords are visible to teachers and administrators of the program. Best practice is NOT to have students use common passwords.<br>
<br>
NO teacher or student data is ever resold or made available for marketing purposes outside of alerts to account status sent out by Typing Agent.<br>
<br>
<strong>What about Cookies?</strong><br>

Typing Agent may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time and we will notify you by email regarding any material changes to our privacy and security practices.<br>
