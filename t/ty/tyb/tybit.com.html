            <p align="center"><strong>tyBit,  INC. PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>tyBit, Inc. (“<strong>tyBit</strong>”)  understands your concern regarding the personal information (“<strong>Information</strong>”)  that you supply or which may be collected while you enjoy its search engine and  other applications. This Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time (“<strong>Privacy  Policy</strong>”), sets out the type of Information collected and the potential use  of that Information. By utilizing tyBit’s search engine and other applications,  you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy  Policy and the Terms of Use, and you consent to the use of your Information in  accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. tyBit may change its  practices at any time without notice and it is your responsibility to review  this Privacy Policy from time to time. You agree that any changes made to this  Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date posted on its website or other  applications, as the case may be.&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><br>
              </strong><br>
              <strong>Privacy Philosophies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br>
              Although our business and search engine have unique services and offerings,  they share a similar privacy philosophy. tyBit follows these privacy principles  in our conduct in the collection, use, release and security of Information both  online and offline: </p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Providing you <strong><u>NOTICE</u></strong> of our information practices. </p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Giving you <strong><u>CHOICES</u></strong> about how your data will be used. </p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Providing you the opportunity to <strong><u>UPDATE or CORRECT</u></strong> your personal information. </p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Using information <strong><u>SECURITY</u></strong> safeguards. </p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Limiting the <strong><u>SHARING</u></strong> of your information. </p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Committing to <strong><u>COMPLYING</u></strong> with applicable privacy  requirements. </p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Providing you with means to <strong><u>CONTACT US</u></strong> about  privacy-related issues. </p>
            <p><strong>Our Technology and the Information We Collect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            </strong>tyBit’s technology provides a method and program for its partners  and advertisers (“<strong>Advertisers</strong>”) to distribute its marketing materials  contained within the tyBit search engine and other applications to you while  receiving valuable and accurate feedback on what you think is interesting.&nbsp; We  collect your  name, electronic mail address and zip code when you  install our technology onto your computer or mobile device.&nbsp; Our technology enables  us to determine (i) your geographic location from either the zip code that you  provide to tyBit when installing tyBit’s search engine and/or other  applications onto your computer or through your GPS of your mobile device; (ii)  your age and income if you voluntarily submit it to tyBit; (iii) your search  terms or interactive behavior with our search engine; (iv) your purchasing  behavior; (v) your computer location through your unique computer IP address;  (vi) source of the information sought by you during your search; and (vii) the  age of your results data (collectively, the “<strong>Collected Information</strong>”). &nbsp;</p>
            <p>This type of technology,  as described in greater detail below, is similar to that used by websites for  the past several years.&nbsp; In fact, when you visit a website and surf around,  your click stream data, or mouse clicks, are being recorded by the web server.&nbsp;  We have essentially transferred a similar capability to our search engine and  other applications and programmed them to send these recordings to a server.&nbsp;  The data is then available for analysis and reporting sorted by unique  computers, rather than unique users.</p>
            <p><strong>TCP-IP</strong> <br>
              In accordance to <em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Wikipedia</span></em>, <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">“[t]he Internet  protocol suite is the set of communications protocols that implement the  protocol stack on which the Internet and most commercial networks run. It has  also been referred to as the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is named after two of  the most important protocols in it: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and  the Internet Protocol (IP), which were also the first two networking protocols  defined.”&nbsp; tyBit utilizes TCP-IP to communicate your Collected Information to  tyBit.</span></p>
            <p><strong>How We Use And Share Information</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              The Collected Information is used to generate reports from your use of our  search engine and other applications, as well as the overall use of all of our Advertisers’  marketing campaigns distributed to you utilizing our technology. &nbsp;tyBit also  uses the Collected Information to create online communities that are based on  their members’ common interests.&nbsp; tyBit does not collect the Collected  Information for any other purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              tyBit discloses to its Advertisers the Collected Information.&nbsp; Again, this data is then available for analysis  and reporting sorted by unique computers, rather than unique users.&nbsp; tyBit also  discloses to its US and foreign subcontractors the Collected Information in  order to provide tyBit related services to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Since our Advertisers are also committed to high privacy standards, they agree  to use the reports that we provide to it to deliver to you their advertisements  based on your interests and demographics, and to evaluate the success of their  search engine or other application marketing campaigns and will not share the  reports with any other party.&nbsp; For a better understanding of our Advertisers’  privacy standards, please visit their Privacy Policy when viewing their  websites.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              From time to time, tyBit may be required to provide the Collected Information  in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as  otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law  enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be  unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such  release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of  others and ourselves. We may also release personal information in the event of  a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              <strong>If you are accessing our search engine or other applications from a country  other than the United States, the Collected Information may be transferred  outside of the country in which you reside or work. Your submission of the Collected  Information constitutes your consent to such transfer of the Collected  Information.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              tyBit takes reasonable efforts to protect the security of the Collected  Information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (“<strong>SSL</strong>”)  software. Further, tyBit takes reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized  third parties from accessing the Collected Information stored at tyBit. Despite  such efforts, hackers may wrongfully gain access to transmissions or to stored  data. tyBit is not liable for damages caused by any such wrongful access. </p>
            <p>Email that you send us is not necessarily  secure against interception. If your email communication includes sensitive  information like your Social Security number, your bank account number, or your  credit or charge card numbers, contact us through one of our secure online  forms or by<strong> </strong><strong>mail or telephone (listed below)</strong>. </p>
