            <h4 align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">WELCOME TO THE TY 
            PRIVACY POLICY</font></h4>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ty Inc. strives to maintain an 
            educational playground for kids and adults all over the world! We 
            have put this section together to provide information for our 
            visitors about privacy concerns, particularly concerns from a 
            parent's perspective. With the attention being given to online 
            safety, we would like to take advantage of this opportunity to 
            address the following issues: </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. What Type of Information We 
            Collect and Why.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As with any site on the World Wide 
            Web, any individual can observe the events taking place on Ty.com; 
            however, in order to participate in the interactive portions of our 
            website, Ty Inc. requires users to register. These interactive 
            portions have a number of features that allow users to post 
            information and write content to our site. By requiring users of our 
            interactive features to register, we can work to make sure that 
            Ty.com remains a safe environment for everyone. For example, in the 
            event questionable material is posted on our site, we have the 
            information necessary to track down the source of the messages and, 
            if necessary, block that user from posting entries in the 
            future.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">During the registration process we ask 
            <i>adult</i> users their names, e-mail addresses, dates of birth, 
            country and state of residence and zip codes. We do not request a 
            home address or telephone number. Before allowing children under 18 
            to register at our site, we first ask for parental permission. Of 
            course, we must collect limited information from children (first 
            name, country and state of residence, and the child and parent's 
            e-mail addresses) in order to obtain parental permission. If we do 
            not obtain permission in a reasonable period of time, that 
            information is destroyed. Before parents provide consent, we ask 
            that they read through this document carefully to understand our 
            privacy policies with regard to their children. After parents 
            provide consent, we will ask children to give some additional 
            personal information, namely gender and zip code. We ask this data 
            so that we can better provide our services to you and your child. 
            Parents, we may also send surveys to your child. Their responses 
            will be aggregated and stored on a non-personal basis.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">At the time of registration, we 
            require both adult and child visitors to establish a "USER ID" which 
            is a password-protected screen name. This is your identity on the 
            site, and all the other users will know you by your USER ID. This 
            eliminates the disclosure of full names or e-mail addresses on our 
            website. However, on the Beanie Board of Trade (BBOT), adult 
            registered users may provide and access contact information from 
            other adult users.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In one, limited circumstance, we will 
            collect personal information from non-registered users, 
            specifically, to fulfill purchase orders at the Ty Store. 
            Non-registered users may purchase product on provision of a valid 
            credit card. The information provided will be used to fulfill the 
            order request, as well as to notify the individual about other Ty 
            products in which we believe he or she may be interested. If you do 
            not want to receive these messages, simply notify us of your wishes 
            by e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@ty.com">contact@Ty.com</a>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We use the information we collect from 
            adult and child users to provide you with a better online 
            experience, to assist us in providing you with our BEANIE products 
            in a fast and efficient manner, and to notify you about exciting new 
            products or features in which we think you may be interested. To 
            give you a better idea, here are a few examples: we ask you for your 
            zip code so that we can find out where our fans live, and make sure 
            our distributors in those areas have enough product on-hand. We ask 
            you for your e-mail address so that we can send you information 
            about our site or our products. We ask for your country so that we 
            know what privacy laws apply to you.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In addition to information we 
            expressly request, we also record certain non-personally 
            identifiable information through the standard operation of Ty's 
            Internet servers. This information allows us to keep our website 
            running efficiently. The information that we record includes the 
            browser (such as Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.) and the 
            operating system (such as Macintosh, Windows 95, etc.) being used by 
            the visitor. Another use of this type of information includes the 
            number of visits to the various pages in our site. E-mail addresses 
            and other personally identifiable data about visits to this site are 
            known only when voluntarily submitted. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ty utilizes a "cookie" application for 
            the limited purposes of recognizing registered visitors, and 
            communicating a personalized welcome message and data displays based 
            on personal preferences (a "cookie" application automatically 
            collects information from a visitor to a website and transfers such 
            information to the visitor's hard drive). We also use cookies to 
            recognize and protect our child visitors.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Personally identifiable information, 
            including names and identities, collected through our website is 
            kept by Ty (and our agents) and is not released, sold, or in any way 
            transferred outside the company or our agents. Ty firmly believes in 
            safety and privacy on the Internet and does not collect information 
            about or disclose the identity of children on the Internet without 
            prior parental approval, nor does it disclose the identity of adults 
            without prior approval. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">One closing note about what we collect 
            and why: Due to overwhelming popular demand, Ty Inc. is pleased to 
            offer a trading forum for its fans, the Beanie Board of Trade 
            (BBOT). On this forum, adult registered users may list items that 
            they wish to sell. Sellers' electronic mail addresses will then be 
            available on demand to potential purchasers (who must be registered 
            adult users). You should not participate in this forum&nbsp;unless 
            you wish for your e-mail address to be shared. To learn more about 
            the BBOT, please read the <a href="/BBOT_RulesOnly">Rules and 
            Regulations</a> for that area.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>2. Your Options.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ty Inc. strives to make its site user 
            friendly, and we have worked hard to give you options about the 
            information you provide to us, and about the activities in which 
            your children may participate. Here are some of the ways we give you 
            control:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you register, you may select 
            whether or not you wish to receive e-mail notices from us about 
            exciting new additions to the Ty.com site. If you change your mind, 
            you may return to your "My Info" profile at any time and update your 
            choice.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Although Ty Inc. will not share your 
            personal information with third parties without your consent, it 
            does provide adult users the opportunity to share information on the 
            BBOT. So please, be careful! Adult users who do not want their 
            personal information to be shared with third parties should not use 
            this area. Remember, if you post something on the BBOT, anyone who 
            wants to contact you will be able to access your electronic mail 
            address.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We want parents to retain control over 
            their children's online experience. When providing parental consent, 
            parents can decide (1) whether or not they want their children to 
            participate in moderated forums, (2) whether or not their children 
            can send electronic mail messages using our web site to people they 
            already know (like sending a BEANIE GREETING to a friend or MY TY 
            FOLIO to a grandparent), and (3) whether we can send e-mail 
            information to the child. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">For users who purchase product at Ty 
            Store, you have the ability to opt out of receiving notices from us 
            by sending us an e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@Ty.com">mailto:contact@Ty.com</a></font></p>

            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Parents, if you want to access the 
            information your child has provided, you have two options. Of 
            course, you can always send us an e-mail message. We'll ask you 
            those same questions to make sure you are who you say you are, and 
            then we'll send it on its way. Also, when you give consent, we will 
            share with you your child's username and password. If you would like 
            to see what information your child has provided, log in as your 
            child, select the "My Info" page, and you will be able to see what 
            additional information (gender and state) they have 
            provided.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>5. Protecting Your Children on 
            Ty.com and other Safety Concerns.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ty is particularly dedicated to 
            providing children with a safe and fun Internet environment. Ty has 
            developed privacy policies that are focused on protecting children, 
            including a general policy not to disclose a child's identity on the 
            site, nor to let the child disclose his or her identity on this 
            site. It is Ty's intention to adhere to the Federal Trade 
            Commission's Rule implementing the Children's Online Privacy 
            Protection Act ("COPPA") as well as the Children's Advertising 
            Review Unit ("CARU") Guidelines for Advertising on the Internet and 
            Online Services.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Before children age 17 or younger can 
            participate in those areas of our site that require registration, 
            including Ty Talk Cyberboard, TyFolio, and Ask Ty, we require 
            parental consent. We do this not only because the law requires it, 
            but also because we are dedicated to providing children with a safe 
            online environment at the Ty.com website. When seeking parental 
            consent, we send parents a notice that includes a copy of this 
            privacy policy so that they can more fully understand our 
            information collection practices. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Moreover, not only do we require 
            parental participation on our site, we have also set up language 
            filters to electronically monitor all entries for objectionable 
            content. Any objectionable entries which are not removed by our 
            electronic filters are removed by our human monitors. If you happen 
            to see a posting anywhere on our website that you feel is 
            objectionable, please use the </font><a href="/Privacy_report"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Emergency E-mail Form</font></a><font face="Comic Sans MS"> </font><font face="Comic Sans MS">which will 
            direct your message to an individual at Ty who will look into the 
            matter as soon as possible.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ty believes that parents should 
            actively supervise and participate in their children's online 
            activities. We comply with the requirements of COPPA, and allow 
            parents to modify any selections they have made for their children. 
            If you no longer want your child to participate in Ty Talk 
            Cyberboard or TyFolio, or if you would like to correct any 
            information that your child has submitted to us, please notify us at 
            contact@Ty.com, and we will make your requested changes within 48 
            hours. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally, to take further measures to 
            protect your child, Ty recommends the use of parental control 
            software tools that are readily available from online services and 
            software manufacturers. Such parental software tools are designed to 
            not only screen out objectionable content, but also to allow parents 
            to prevent their children from disclosing names, addresses, and 
            other personal information without parental permission.</font></p>
