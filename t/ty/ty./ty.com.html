WELCOME TO THE PARENT's RESOURCE:<br></p><p></p></center>

<img src="/graphics/4998.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100">Hi!  My name is Batty<superscript><font size="-2">TM</font></superscript> the bat and I am a proud member of Ty's <i>Beanie Babies Collection</i>.  I have put this section together with my friends at Ty to provide information for our visitor's from a parent's prospective.  <br><p>

My friends at Ty strive to maintain an educational playground for kids and adults all over the world!  With the attention being given to on-line safety, we would like to take advantage of this opportunity to address the following issues:<br></p><p>

As with any site on the World Wide Web, any individual can observe the events taking place on the Web; however, in order to participate in any shape or form, Ty Inc. requires users to register.  Our registration form requests users to include their name and e-mail address.  Any other entries are completely optional.  Birthdays are requested so that Ty can send you or your child a birthday wish.  You do not have to enter your or your child's birthday if you do not want to do so.  That information is never shared with anyone outside of Ty, and it is never used for advertising, promotion or marketing purposes.  We do not request a home address or telephone number.  The interactive nature of our Web site has resulted in a number of features that allow users to post information and write content to our site.  As a protective measure, we request all individuals to provide some minimal information about themselves.  In the event questionable material is posted on our site, we have the necessary information to track down the source of the messages and if necessary, block that user from posting entries in the future.  Additionally, we require our visitors to establish a "USER ID" which is a password protected screen name.  This is your identity on the site, and completely eliminates the disclosure of full names or e-mail addresses on our Web site.  <br>
</p><p>
Ty does not utilize a "cookie" application, which automatically collects personal information from a visitor to a Web site and transfers such information to the visitor's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  However certain non-personally-identifiable information is recorded by the standard operation of Ty's Internet servers.  This information allows us to keep our Web site running efficiently.  The information that we record includes the browser (such as Netscape, Internet Explorer) and the operating system used (such as Macintosh, Windows 95) being used by the visitor.  Another use of this type of information includes the number of visitors to the various pages in our site but only in a combined and non-personally-identifiable form.  E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known only when voluntarily submitted.<br>
</p><p>
Information, including names and identities, collected through our Web site is kept by Ty and is not released, sold, or in any way transferred outside the company.  Ty firmly believes in safety and privacy on the Internet and does not disclose the identity of children or adults on the Internet without prior approval.<br>
</p><p>
Ty is particularly dedicated to providing children with a safe and fun Internet environment.  Ty has developed privacy policies that are focused on protecting children, and it is Ty's intention to adhere to the Children's Advertising Review Unit ("CARU") Guildlines for Advertising on the Internet and on-line services.  Before children age 17 or younger can interact with others at our site, we require that they obtain parental consent.  Furthermore, we have developed a symbol (<img src="/graphics/heart-star.gif" alt="" width="35" height="30&quot;">) that will allow parents and children to easily distinguish material that is of an advertising or promotional nature.  
<br>
</p><p>
When references are made to children in the Internet diary, we include first names only.  Additionally, in the Internet Gallery, Scrapbook and Art Gallery, we edit all letters and envelopes to make certain that last names and addresses are not disclosed.  With the Beanie Babies Honor Roll, any listing to this section of the site is completely voluntary and requires parental permission.  Furthermore, when we reprint newspaper articles in the Beanie Babies Honor Roll, we makes certain to block out any last names and will only include photographs of children once we have received a Consent and Release form from a parent and have confirmed the parental consent over the telephone.  Even when parents request and provide written permission for their child's last name to be included in the Beanie Babies Honor Roll lists, we refrain from posting any references to the geographical areas of residence.  <br></p><p>

The Beanie Babies Guestbook is monitored regularly for objectionable content.  All segments of this Web site that allow users to post information have language filters that are designed to electronically monitor all entries for objectionable content.  Any entries which are not removed by our electronic filters are removed through our regular monitoring.  If you happen to see a posting anywhere on our site that you feel is objectionable, please utilize the emergency e-mail address listed in the <a href="http://www.ty.com/cgi-bin/guestbkcomplaint.cgi">Beanie Info</a> section which will direct your message to one of my friends at Ty who will look into the matter as soon as possible.<br></p><p>

My friends at Ty are always learning of new ways to promote safety on the Internet, particularly for children.  Following is a preview of some of the changes we will be making to our Web site in the near future to promote safety on the Internet:<br></p><p>

</p><ul list="disc">
<li>A section completely devoted to safety on the Internet brought to you by our Web expert, Waves the whale!  He knows all about the Internet and how to be safe - he will be sharing some of his best tips with us.
</li><li>My friends at Ty are going to amend the Beanie Babies Network to allow users to locate penpals within a selected age group without having to disclose their e-mail address.
</li></ul>

Ty believes that parents should actively supervise and participate in their children's on-line activities.  Further, Ty recommends the use of parental control software tools that are readily available from on-line services and software manufacturers.  Such parental software tools are designed to not only to screen out objectionable content, but also to allow parents to prevent their children from disclosing names, addresses, and other personal information without parental permission.  For information about obtaining parental control tools, please visit an Internet directory site, such as <i>Yahoo</i>Â® at Business and Economy: Companies: Software: Internet: Blocking and Filtering: Titles).<br>
<p>
My friends at Ty believe in on-line safety and would welcome any suggestions that you may have.  If you would like to e-mail my friends at Ty regarding any questions or suggestions that you have about this Web site or on-line safety, please mail them at parents@ty.com.  If you would like to report an emergency, please use the form in the <a href="http://www.ty.com/cgi-bin/guestbkcomplaint.cgi">Beanie Info</a> section.  <br>

Thank you for reading my letter!<br></p><p>
