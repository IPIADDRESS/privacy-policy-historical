          Tyndale.com, the Internet site located at <a href="http://www.tyndale.com">http://www.tyndale.com</a> (the "Site"), is operated and
          maintained by Tyndale House Publishers ("Tyndale").  This Privacy Policy describes Tyndale's policies and
          procedures for the collection of personal information by this Site, and our use and dissemination of such

          periodically so that you are up to date on our policies and practices. If there is a material change in
          those policies or practices that relate to the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal

Tyndale.com's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.  This policy's statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it.  Using the internet should be a fun and positive experience and we want to help you enjoy it.

          collection, use and disclosure of personal information furnished to us by visitors to our Site who are age
          13 and over. Section II describes the special additional policies Tyndale applies to the collection,
          use and disclosure of personal information about visitors to our Site who are under age 13. Parents
          should read both Sections to obtain a full understanding of Tyndale's privacy policies and practices. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
<b>          I. POLICIES THAT APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS AGE 13 AND OVER COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY TYNDALE</b></font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"=""><b>

          General.</b> Personally identifiable information about visitors to this Site (that is, information such as a
          visitor's name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number) is collected only when knowingly
          and voluntarily submitted. Such information may be requested in connection with our sweepstakes,
          contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards,
          guestbooks, requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for products or services, and visitors' requests
          for additional information. Tyndale does not require a visitor to disclose more information than is
          reasonably necessary to participate in the online activity he or she is interested in.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Joint Collection of Personal Information. Sometimes Tyndale collects personal information jointly
          with business partners or sponsors. The identity of the entities collecting personal information will be
          clear at the time your personal information is collected. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
        <b>  WHAT TYNDALE DOES (AND DOESN'T DO) WITH THE PERSONAL
          INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
         <b> General.</b> Tyndale uses personally identifiable information only for the purpose for which it is
          submitted unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection, in which case you will have the
          opportunity to instruct us not to use your data in other ways (i.e., "opt-out").
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Sharing Personal Information. Tyndale may share personally identifiable information with our affiliates or with 
          some of our business partners who would like to send you information about their products or services. However, 
          when we collect your information you will have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information in these 
          ways (i.e., opt-out"). 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">

   <b>       LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Tyndale has established relationships with advertisers and reputable business partners that allow
          visitors to our Site to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites, may be
          "co-branded" with a Tyndale logo; however, they are not operated or maintained by Tyndale.
          These sites may collect personal information from you. This Privacy Policy will apply to any personal
          information we obtain in this manner from our partners.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Tyndale chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, Tyndale is not
          responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our
          Site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute
          sponsorship, endorsement or approval by Tyndale of the content, policies or practices of such third
          party sites. We are not responsible for any information these sites may obtain and do not oversee their
          policies or practices in collecting personal information. Therefore, once you have left this Site via such a
          link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          This Site may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with Tyndale.
          Tyndale may share information collected by these affiliated companies; however, this
          Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we receive in this manner. Visitors to our affiliated
          sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices when providing any personally
          identifiable information.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
   <b>       NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things,
          which web pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks, if any, were
          "clicked" by the visitor. Tyndale, like most major web sites, collects such information by placing
          small bits of information, known as "cookies", on the hard drive of your computer to log IP addresses,
          operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), type of browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator
          or Internet Explorer), and Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) used by each visitor to
          the Site. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Cookies enable us to do a number of things to make your visit and future visits to the site more
          enjoyable. For example, cookies allow a visitor to quickly log on to a site he/she has used before by
          storing a password. By tracking how many people visit our Site and where they go, we are able to
          determine which part of the Site users like the best, which part needs some improvement and what
          changes should be made. By obtaining this information, we are able to continually improve our Site and
          bring you the best online experience possible.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Although the cookie itself does not collect any personally identifiable information about a visitor, and
          Tyndale does not use cookies in order to obtain such information, the cookie can be used to
          determine the IP address of the visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or
          her point of connectivity to the Internet. Tyndale may also disclose some of the non-personally
          identifiable information we obtain to advertisers to inform them how many people have seen or linked
          to their advertisements on our Site. However, we do not disclose personally identifiable information to
          these advertisers. Visitors may also receive cookies from third parties, but Tyndale cannot control
          the content of these cookies.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Tyndale does not save credit card information in a cookie.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          You should consult your browser owner's manual for instructions on how to refuse cookies.

   <b>       REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
          INFORMATION </b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Visitors may review or delete personal information from our records at any time. If you would like to
          know the types of personal information Tyndale collects from visitors to the Site, please contact us
          at <a href="mailto:comments@tyndale.com">comments@tyndale.com</a> or write to us at Tyndale House Publishers Attn: Internet Group, 
          351 Executive Drive, Carol Stream, IL 60188. If you would like to know whether we have collected personal
          information about you, please provide us with the activities that you participated in on the Site, which
          requested personal information. After we have reviewed the relevant databases, we will confirm
          whether we have collected such information about you. Prior to changing or deleting such information,
          we require that you provide us with proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver's license.
          Once we have received such proof and determined that it is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or
          modify your information in our database and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable
          information from you, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain
          within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This residual
          information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
<b>          SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Tyndale has established and maintains reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security
          and integrity of personal information collected by this Site.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
   <b>       II. ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT APPLY TO CHILDREN UNDER 13 KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          We at Tyndale understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new
          and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and
          contests, email, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. Tyndale also recognizes
          the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information this
          Site collects from children. Parents of children who visit this Site can be confident that any personal
          information that may be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained in accordance with the
          Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Tyndale encourages parents to supervise their
          children's activities online and to participate with their children's online activities whenever possible.
          However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their children's activities on
          the Internet. That's why Tyndale has developed a Site that parents can feel is safe for their children
          and kids will find cool, informative, educational, and fun! Because there's always room for
          improvement, Tyndale welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, safer place to
          hang out.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
   <b>       COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM
          CHILDREN UNDER 13</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, Tyndale does not require the disclosure of more
          personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an
          activity as a condition of such participation. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          Tyndale may use different types of personally identifiable information submitted to this Site by
          children under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below. In each instance, we comply with
          the parental consent requirements of COPPA.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
          

          A. Use of a Child's Information by Tyndale
</font></p><ul><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
    <li>     We may collect a child's email address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole
          purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest winner).
          This information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be deleted from our records when the
          contest or game is over. Parental consent will be obtained before we send the winner a prize.<p>

    </p></li><li>     We may collect a child's email address in order to respond more than once to a child's specific
          request. For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online
          communications from Tyndale. In these instances Tyndale will also obtain a parent's email address
          along with the child's. Before any further contact with the child, Tyndale will send an email to the
          parent (a) notifying him or her we have collected the child's email address in order to respond more
          than once to the child's request for a subscription, information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or
          she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (c) informing the parent that if
          he or she does not respond to the email within 72 hours, Tyndale may use the child's information for
          the purpose for which it was submitted.<p>

     </p></li><li> We may collect a child's personally identifiable information (including name, email address, mailing
          address and phone number) for such activities as chats, forums, surveys, games, guestbooks, bulletin
          boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content submissions, requests for products
          or services, or requests for additional information. In these instances we will initially collect only the
          child's name and online contact information and the email address of the child's parent. Before using this
          information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email that (a) informs the parent that we wish to
          collect and use the child's personal information and need the parent's consent to do so, and (b)
          provides the parent with a link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information
          collection and use policies as required by COPPA. If the proposed use of the child's personal
          information does not involve disclosure to a third party, then Tyndale will ask the parent to provide
          consent by return email. Upon receipt of the email consent, we will send the parent a confirming email.
          If the proposed use of the child's personal information involves disclosure to third parties, the email we
          send to the parent will ask the parent either to (i) return by postal mail or fax a consent form that will be
          attached to the email, or (ii) call a toll free number where consent can be given over the phone. If
          parental consent is not obtained by one of these methods within one week Tyndale will delete all of
          the child's and parent's personally identifiable information from its records. In addition, parents can
          revoke a prior consent at any time.<p>

     </p></li><li> We may collect a child's name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the
          security of this Site, to protect against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information collected
          for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.
</li></font></ul><font face="arial" "helvetica"="">
<p>
          B. Sharing Children's Personal Information With Third Parties. 
</p><p>
          Tyndale may share a child's personal with other affiliates who may send you information about their products or
          services. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the
          personal information they obtain from Tyndale. As noted above, parents may exercise their option
          not to consent to the disclosure of their child's personal information to third parties. Parents may
          consent to Tyndale's collection and use of a child's personal information without consenting to the
          disclosure of the information to third parties. 
</p><p>
   <b>       LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES</b>
</p><p>
          As noted in Section I of this Privacy Policy, this Site may link directly to sites operated by Tyndale House Publishers
          advertisers, business partners and affiliated companies. Those sites, which are not controlled by
          Tyndale House Publishers may collect personal information from your child. Parents should therefore check the
          relevant site's privacy policy to understand how it collects and uses children's personal information.
          Tyndale House Publishers will not share in any personal information obtained by a site from a child under the age of 13
          unless that site follows the requirements of COPPA.
</p><p>
   <b>       REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
          INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13</b>
</p><p>
          Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from
          our records at any time. If you would like to know the types of personal information we collect, please
          contact us at <a href="mailto:comments@tyndale.com">comments@tyndale.com</a> or write to us at Tyndale House Publishers Attn: Internet Group
          351 Executive Drive, Carol Stream, IL 60188.  If you would like to know whether we have collected 
          personal information about your child, please provide us with the activities that he or she participated in
          on the Site which requested personal information. After we have reviewed the relevant databases, we
          will confirm whether we have collected such information about your child. Prior to changing or deleting
          such infromation, we require that you provide us with proof of your name and address, such as a valid
          driver's license, and proof that your child resides with you or is otherwise in your custody. Once we
          have received such proof and determined that it is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or modify
          your child's information in our database and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable
          information from your child, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will
          remain within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This
          residual information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.
