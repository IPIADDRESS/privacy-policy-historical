                  <p>We at TYNT, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“TYNT”) are committed to providing web sites and software products that respect the privacy of its visitors and users respectively.&nbsp; This page summarizes the privacy policy and practices for all TYNT Web Sites, as well as for the TYNT software products.</p>

            <p>When you first register TYNT Products, you will be asked to provide us with personal information such as your name, an Email address for us to contact you and certain information you wish to share with other users.&nbsp; Certain aspects of this information will be displayed for others users of TYNT Products, depending on your selection of privacy settings.&nbsp; As well, we may occasionally use your name and Email address in order to send you information on products or services, provided by TYNT or others, which we feel may be of interest to you.&nbsp; Further, TYNT may send you service related announcements, such as warning you of upcoming updates, service outages, or other information which we feel you may be interested in.&nbsp; You will have the option to opt out of some of these announcements, but TYNT reserves the right to provide certain of these announcements regardless of your opting out of receipt of these announcements, should you choose use the TYNT Products.</p>
