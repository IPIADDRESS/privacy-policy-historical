          FUND’S PRIVACY POLICY</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your privacy concerns 
          are important to TDF. This Policy Statement is designed to inform you 
          about TDF’s privacy principles and its policy regarding use data.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Overview</b><br>
          The only information TDF obtains about individual visitors to its Web 
          site is that supplied voluntarily. Personally identifiable information 
          provided by a visitor (name, email or home address, etc.) will not be 
          disclosed to anyone unless the visitor expressly permits TDF to do so. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination 
          practices:<br>
          <br>
          <b>Personally Identifying Information</b><br>
          TDF does not require you to register or furnish any personal information 
          as a condition of using our Web site. We collect personally identifying 
          information only if you voluntarily provide it to us.<br>
          <br>
          TDF logs Internet protocol (IP) addresses to conduct system administration, 
          report aggregate information, and conduct site analysis. An IP address 
          is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access 
          the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted 
          with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and 
          communicate with each other. If a visitor requests pages from TDF, TDF 
          servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor 
          anonymity, TDF does not associate IP addresses with records containing 
          personal information. However, TDF will use IP addresses to identify 
          any visitors who refuse to comply with TDF's in-house rules or terms 
          of service, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, 
          customers or others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cookies</b> <br>
          TDF uses cookies only to enhance your web browsing experience. (A cookie 
          is a unique number assigned to you and stored on a cookie file on your 
          computer). The first time TDF serves you a page, our site places a text 
          file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. 
          Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's 
          hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Our site uses cookies only to 
          identify you during your visit; they do not contain personal information 
          and we do not use them to store personal information about you, track 
          your movements to other sites or sell information about you to others. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>External Links</b><br>
          In order to provide visitors with greater value, TDF may provide links 
          to various third-party Web sites. However, even if an affiliation exists 
          between TDF and that third-party site, TDF exercises no control over 
          linked sites, each of which maintains independent privacy and data collection 
          policies and procedures. If you visit a website which is linked to TDF, 
          you should consult that Web site’s privacy policy before providing 
          any personally identifying information.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Surveys and Questionnaires</b><br>
          Our online surveys and questionnaires may ask visitors, on an anonymous 
          basis, for health and demographic information. If contact information 
          is requested, TDF will use it only for the purpose of contacting the 
          visitor when necessary. Demographic and profile data collected at our 
          site is not shared with others. Public Forums<br>
          TDF may provide its users with chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or 
          news groups. Please remember that any information disclosed in these 
          areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when 
          deciding to disclose your personal information. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Security</b><br>
          TDF’s Web site has security measures in place to protect the loss, 
          misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Personal 
          information furnished to TDF as part of its clinical trial survey is 
          stored in a secured database and always sent via an encrypted Internet 
          channel. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Privacy Policy Changes </b><br>

          those changes here so that you will always know what information we 
          gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose
