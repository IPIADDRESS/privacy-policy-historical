                  <p><strong><strong>TDS Privacy Policy</strong></strong></p>
<p>By using  our Web site or subscribing to one or more of our “Services,” You agree to our  collection and use of Your personal information as described in this Privacy  Policy. If we change our privacy policy and procedures, we will post these  changes on our Web sites: <a href="http://www.tdstelecom.com" target="_blank">www.tdstelecom.com</a>; <a href="http://www.tdsmetro.com" target="_blank">www.tdsmetro.com</a>; <a href="http://www.tds.net" target="_blank">www.tds.net</a>; <a href="http://www.tdsmetro.net" target="_blank">www.tdsmetro.net</a>. Your  continued use of this site following the posting of any changes to these terms  constitutes acceptance of those changes.<br>
  <br>
1. TDS  and its affiliated companies, including TDS Metrocom (TDS), place a high value  on personal privacy and is committed to protecting the “Personal Information”  collected from users of its Services and its websites.&nbsp; Such Personal Information collected may  include name, address, telephone number, personal computer specifications and  billing information such as a credit card number if required for service. The Personal  Information collected is used to provide a tailored service to You in order to  better manage Your account. This may include customizing Your shopping  experiences, responding to Your requests and communicating with You  electronically. In addition, TDS may collect information about You from our  trusted vendors, such as updated delivery and address information, so that we  can correct our records and deliver Your purchases or communicate with You more  efficiently.<br>
<br>
2. TDS  will not share or sell Your Personal Information collected online, with third  parties, other than to TDS subsidiaries or vendors, including payment  processors, content providers, shipping vendors, preferred providers that sell  products or services to You on our Web site and others who perform similar  functions on behalf of TDS.&nbsp; Disclosure  of personal information may, however, be necessary or appropriate in special  circumstances, such as when TDS in good faith believes that disclosure is  required or authorized by law, to investigate possible crimes, to protect TDS’ legal  rights, or in connection with a  sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution involving  TDS.<br>
<br>
3.  Additionally, TDS may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales,  Web site patterns and general Web site information to our affiliates and other  vendors with whom we do business, but this will not include any Personal Information.  For example, TDS has relationships with companies that place advertising on our  site. As a result of Your visit to our site, such companies may collect  information such as Your domain type, Your IP address and clickstream  information. In addition, if You are a customer of TDS Internet Services, then  TDS Internet Services may collect statistical information on the performance of  Your connection, which allows us to improve the service.<br>
<br>
4. Customer Proprietary Network Information  (CPNI) is information that TDS obtains in connection with providing  telecommunications services to You. CPNI includes the types of  telecommunications services You currently purchase, how You use those services,  and related billing information for those services. CPNI also typically  includes the type of information found on Your telephone bill, such as call  details and the types of local, long distance and wireless telecommunications  services that You have purchased. CPNI does not include Your telephone number,  name and address. <br>
TDS uses technical and policy measures to safeguard the privacy of  CPNI and help protect it from unauthorized access or improper use.&nbsp; TDS <em><em>does  not sell CPNI to third parties and complies with applicable federal and state  CPNI rules that apply to telecommunications carriers.&nbsp; </em></em><br>
TDS or its authorized representatives may use CPNI information to  make suggestions to You and discuss products and services, packages, and  promotions that may serve Your communications needs or to let You know about  enhancements to services You already use. TDS will not use Your CPNI for any  other marketing purpose without Your approval.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
TDS is required to provide directories and directory information  (name, address and phone number) to authorized third parties, for example,  directory publishers.&nbsp; You can restrict  the publication of personal information in phone books, online directories and  directory assistance, through services such as “non-published” and “non-listed”  numbers. Contact Your customer service representative to discuss options  available to You.<br>
<br>
5. TDS may  monitor the Service and may disclose information regarding Your use of the  Service and Personal Information to satisfy laws, regulations or governmental  requests; to operate the Service properly; and, to protect itself and its  customers.<br>
<br>
6. TDS is  not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our  Web site nor for the content contained therein. The Web sites and services You  are able to access on the Internet are outside the control and limits of this  privacy policy. Any information You provide to any such organizations is at  Your own risk.<br>
<br>
7. TDS makes  commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the security of our servers and  computer networks in order to help prevent the loss, misuse, and modification  of the Personal Information in our possession. TDS protects the security of  Your Personal Information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software during  registration or enrollment, while shopping on TDS Web sites or when paying Your  monthly TDS statement.&nbsp; Even though we  take commercially reasonable steps to maintain information security, and expect  our vendors to do likewise, TDS cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information.<br>
<br>
8. TDS  may store small data files, called cookies, on Your computer when You visit  certain Web sites. Cookies allow TDS to personalize Your service by collecting  and storing information that will identify You when You visit a site. You can  disable cookies on Your computer; however if You do so, You will not be able to  maximize Your experience on our site, including finding pricing and  availability of products and services in Your area. TDS is not responsible for  the cookies used by Web sites linked to or from our Web site.<br>
<br>
9. It is  TDS policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998  and all other applicable laws relating to children’s privacy.&nbsp; In order to respect the privacy of children  online, TDS does not knowingly collect, maintain or process Personal  Information submitted by children under the age of 13.<br>
<br>
10. If  You do not want TDS to use Your Personal Information to contact You for  marketing or solicitation purposes (excluding notices about Your existing  account), You may make this request to <a href="mailto:webcontact@tdstelecom.com">webcontact@tdstelecom.com</a> or to TDS  Telecom, 525 Junction Road,   Madison, Wisconsin 53717.
