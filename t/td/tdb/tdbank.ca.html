</p><p class="sectionhead"><a name="a">The TD Bank Financial Group commitment to privacy</a>

</p><p>Protecting your privacy and the
confidentiality of your personal
information has always been
fundamental to the way we do
business within TD Bank
Financial Group<sup><font class="footer">1</font></sup>.

</p><p>We strive to provide you with the
best customer service. To us, that
includes treating you fairly and
with respect.


</p><p>This Privacy Code² informs you of
our policy on privacy, and tells you
about the ways we help ensure that
your privacy and the confidentiality
of your information are protected.


</p><p></p><div align="right" class="footer"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>		  		
			
<p><a name="b"><font class="pageTitleB">Our privacy policy</font></a></p>
			
<p>Our privacy policy informs you of the policies and practices we have in place relating to the management of personal information at TD Bank Financial Group. This policy applies to personal
customers, including individuals carrying on
business alone or in partnership with other
individuals. It consists of five key principles:


</p><p><font class="sectionhead">1. Collecting and using information</font></p>

<p>Either before or when we collect information
about you, we will explain how we intend
to use it. We will limit the information we
collect to what we need for those purposes,
and we will use it only for those purposes.
We will obtain your consent if we wish to
use your information for any other purpose
and before collecting information from third
parties such as credit bureaus.
</p><p>
Your personal financial information is used
to help us manage operations and risk within
TD Bank Financial Group. Your information
is also used in order to satisfy valid
information requests from regulators and
other organizations or individuals who are
legally entitled to make such requests.
</p><p>
<font class="sectionsubhead">Call Taping</font>
</p><p>
We may monitor and/or record your telephone
discussions with our representatives for our
mutual protection, to enhance customer service,
and to confirm our discussions with you.
</p><p>
Customers who prefer not to have their calls
taped can transact business at a branch
location, through EasyWeb, or through
automated banking machines.



</p><p><font class="sectionhead">2. Releasing information</font></p>
			
<p>We may provide your information to
other persons -
</p><ul>
	<li>where we have your consent</li>
	<li>where the other parties are our suppliers
or agents who assist us in serving you</li>
	<li> where we are required or permitted to
	do so by law or applicable regulators and
self-regulatory organizations</li>
	<li>where transfers of a business are involved</li>
</ul>


<p><font class="sectionhead">3. Protecting information</font></p>
<p>We will protect your information with
appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We will retain your information only for the
time it is required for the purposes we explain.
</p>

<p><font class="sectionhead">4. Providing information access and accuracy</font> 
</p><p>We will give you access to the information
we retain about you. We will make every
reasonable effort to keep your information
accurate and up-to-date.

</p>

<p><font class="sectionhead">5. Respecting and responding to your privacy concerns</font></p>
<p>In this Privacy Code, we will explain your
options for refusing or withdrawing consent
to the collection, use and release of your
information, and we will record and respect
your choices. We will investigate and respond
to your concerns about any aspect of our
handling of your information.

</p><p>In this Privacy Code, we will explain how
we fulfill each of these important principles.</p>


	      
<p></p><div align="right" class="footer"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>		  		

<p><a name="c"><font class="pageTitleB">Why we ask for your information</font></a></p>
<p><i>We ask you for information to establish and
serve you as our customer.</i>

</p><p>We obtain most of our information about
you directly from you. The information we
ask for depends on which product or service
you want. For every product or service,
we need your name, address, birthdate,
occupation and some identification. Here is
why we need some of the other information
we ask you to provide.


</p><p>• <font class="sectionhead">Birth date</font></p>
<p>This helps us identify you and ensure that
no one is trying to impersonate you. We
may also use it to determine your eligibility
for products and services that may be of
benefit to a particular age group.
</p>

<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Social Insurance Number (SIN)</font></p>
<p>Your SIN is required for products which
earn investment income, in order to comply
with the Canada Revenue Agency's income
reporting requirements. Providing your
SIN for credit products is optional. If you
provide your SIN, we also use it to keep
your information separate from that of other
customers with a similar name, including
information we obtain with your consent
through the credit approval process.
</p>

<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Financial information</font></p>
<p>This is used to assess your eligibility for
any credit product, for example, a TD <i>Visa</i>
card, line of credit or other loan. We also
use it to ensure that the advice we give you
or the investments you purchase (in the case
of mutual funds or brokerage or investment
accounts) are appropriate for you. We may
collect information from you and service
providers with whom you make
arrangements to provide those services
(for example when you set up bill payments
through your account). We will use your
financial information, including transaction
records that reflect your business dealings
with and through us, to help us serve you
as a customer and meet your financial needs.

</p>

<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Health information</font></p>

<p>This is required for some insurance products
to ensure you are eligible for coverage,
and may also be used to investigate and
adjudicate your claims, and to help manage
and assess our risks.
</p><p>
The health-related information you
provide in connection with an insurance
product will never be shared within
TD Bank Financial Group; however, it may be
shared with administrators, service providers
and reinsurers of the insurance operations to
process your insurance transactions.
</p><p>
<i>We only collect the information we need and
only use it for the purposes explained to you.</i>
</p><p>
When you apply for a new product or service,
we will indicate in the application or agreement
how we intend to use your information. We
will only ask for the information we need for
that particular product or service. We will
indicate clearly which information would help
us to serve you but is optional for you to provide.

	      
</p><p></p><div align="right" class="footer"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>


<p><a name="obtainconsent"><font class="pageTitleB">How we obtain your consent</font></a></p>
<p><i>It is important to understand the different ways that we may obtain your consent to collect, use, disclose and share your personal information. </i>
</p><p>
Depending on the situation and the sensitivity of the information, we may obtain your consent in different ways. Express consent may be obtained verbally, online or in writing. Implied consent may be obtained through your use of a product, or when you approach us to obtain products or services from us.
 </p><p>
We will not make your consent a condition of obtaining a product or service, unless it is reasonably or legally required, and we will clearly indicate when this is the case.


</p><p></p><div align="right" class="footer"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>

<p><a name="e"><font class="pageTitleB">Why we share
your information</font></a></p>

<p><i>We share information within
TD Bank Financial Group to manage our
business risks and operations, and to comply
with legal or regulatory requirements.
</i></p><p><i>
With your consent, we may share your
information within TD Bank Financial Group.
This will help us serve you better and
determine whether any products or services
of TD Bank Financial Group are suitable
for you so that we can offer them to you.
</i></p>

<p>We want to serve you better and meet
your customer service expectations.
Agreeing to let us share your information
within TD Bank Financial Group helps
us to meet this goal.
</p><p>
Sharing information lets us instantly
recognize your total relationship with
TD Bank Financial Group, no matter when
or where you contact us or which one of us
you contact. It also means that in some
circumstances, changes to your information
can be made once and be effective for
all your products or services with
TD Bank Financial Group.
</p><p>
Sharing your information also helps us
determine your financial needs because it
allows us to review what TD Bank Financial
Group products you have and how you
use them. We may then offer you other
TD Bank Financial Group products and
services - including special promotions -
that we believe will be of interest to you.
</p><p>
This consent is optional and you can decide
to withdraw it at any time for the purposes
listed above. Please refer to the "Respecting
your preference" section.

		  
</p><p></p><div align="right" class="footer"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>		  		


















	  	
<p><a name="e_a"><font class="pageTitleB">Why we ask others for information about you</font></a></p>

<p><i>With your consent, we may obtain information
about you from third parties, including credit
reporting agencies.
</i></p>

<p>Obtaining additional information about you
from parties outside TD Bank Financial Group
helps us assess your eligibility for our products.
</p><p>
For credit products, for example, we need to
know your creditworthiness. For this reason,
we may contact other lenders or credit
reporting agencies to get information about
you and your credit history. We may also
contact employers or other personal
references to verify information that you
have given us. We will not do this without
your consent, but please remember that if
you do not give your consent we may not
be able to extend credit services to you.
</p>
		  
<p></p><div align="right" class="footer"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>		  			
		  
		  <p><a name="f"><font class="pageTitleB">When we release your information</font></a></p>
<p><i>We do not sell or rent  customer lists or personal information
to others.  However, we may release
your information to parties outside
TD Bank Financial Group in certain
circumstances, which include -
</i></p>

<p>• <font class="sectionhead">With your consent</font></p>
<p>On an ongoing basis, we will disclose your
credit history with us to other lenders or
credit reporting agencies in order to support
the credit process. We release only the
information required to identify you, as well
as facts from our credit records about your
repayment history.
</p>

<p>• <font class="sectionhead">For servicing purposes</font></p>
<p>We give a limited amount of information,
only as necessary, without your consent,
to our suppliers and agents; for example,
cheque printers and bank card manufacturers
who provide goods and services to you
through us. These suppliers and agents may
be located in other jurisdictions or countries and may disclose information in response to valid demands or requests from governments, regulators, courts and law enforcement authorities in those jurisdictions or countries.

</p>

<p>• <font class="sectionhead">When required or permitted to do so
by law or applicable regulators and
self-regulatory organizations
</font></p>
<p>We may release information in response to a
search warrant, court order, or other demand or enquiry which we believe to be valid. This may include requests from regulators, including
self-regulators, who are responsible for
ensuring TD Bank Financial Group is in
compliance with applicable regulations (e.g. The Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions
and the Investment Dealers Association of
Canada). We may disclose information to
help us collect a debt owed to us by you.
We may also disclose information to an
investigative body in the case of a breach
of agreement or contravention of law - this
helps prevent fraud, money laundering or
other criminal activity.

</p>  

<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Transfers of a business</font></p>
<p>As TD Bank Financial Group continues to
develop and grow, we may buy or sell parts
of our businesses. As our businesses consist
primarily of our customer relationships,
personal customer information and information
regarding the particular account or service
being purchased or sold would generally be
one of the transferred business assets.

</p><p></p><div align="right" class="footer"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>		  		
		  
		  
		<p><a name="g"><font class="pageTitleB">How we protect your information</font></a></p>		 
<p><i>We will protect your information with
appropriate safeguards and security measures.
</i></p>

<p>We have thorough security standards to
protect our systems and your information
against unauthorized access and use.
</p><p>
For example, our systems have been designed to
ensure that your Personal Identification Number
(PIN), password and other access codes are
always private and confidential. When you use
your PIN at an automated banking machine, it is
scrambled after you enter it. For your protection,
your access codes are known only to you - our
employees cannot gain access to them and they
will not ask you to reveal them.
</p><p>
All our suppliers and agents, as part of their
contracts with TD Bank Financial Group,
are bound to maintain your confidentiality
and may not use the information for any
unauthorized purpose.
</p><p>
When we provide information in response
to a legal enquiry or order, we ensure that
the order is valid and we disclose only the
information that is legally required.
</p><p>
All employees of TD Bank Financial Group
are familiar with the procedures that must be
taken to safeguard customer information. And
to us, protecting the confidentiality of your
information is more than a procedure - it's part
of our job. It is specified in our employment
agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.
</p><p>
<i>We audit our procedures and security
measures regularly to ensure that they are
being properly administered and that they
remain effective and appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
</i></p><p><i>
We retain your information only as long as
it is required for the reasons it was collected.</i>
</p><p>
The length of time we retain information
varies depending on the product or service
and the nature of the information. This
period may extend beyond the end of your
relationship with us but only for so long
as it is legally necessary for us to have
sufficient information to respond to any
issue that may arise at a later date. When
your information is no longer needed for
the purposes explained to you, we have
procedures to destroy, delete, erase or
convert it to an anonymous form.

		  <p><a name="h"><font class="pageTitleB">Your right to access your information</font></a></p>

<p><i>We will give you access to the information
we have about you. If requested, we will assist you in making your request. 
</i></p>
		  
<p>Most of this information is in the form of your
transaction records. These are available to you
through your account statements or passbook
updates, by visiting the branch or office where
your account is held, or by accessing your
account through our EasyWeb Internet
banking, EasyLine™ telephone banking,
Wireless banking, Green Machine* automated
banking machines, and brokerage services.
</p><p>
If you require other information, simply
contact or forward a written request to the
branch or office where your account is held.
We will ask you for specific details such as
branch and account number. We will advise
you in advance if a minimal charge will be
required for conducting the search, and we
will respond to your request within 30 days.
</p><p>
Please note that we may not be able to provide
information about you from our records which
contains references to other persons, is subject
to legal privilege, contains confidential
information proprietary to TD Bank Financial
Group, relates to an investigation of a breach
of agreement or contravention of laws, or
cannot be disclosed for other legal reasons.
Also, we do not maintain disclosure records
for regular or routine actions such as T5 or
other reports to Canada Revenue Agency,
regular updating of credit information to
credit reporting agencies, or account balance
deficiencies through the return of NSF items.
</p><p>
If you have any questions regarding decisions
made about you, we will tell you the reasons
for those decisions. Where relevant, we will
provide you with the name and address of the
credit bureau from which a report was obtained.

	<p><a name="i"><font class="pageTitleB">Keeping your information accurate</font></a></p>
<p><i>We will make every reasonable effort to keep
your information accurate and up-to-date.
</i></p>

<p>Having accurate information about you
enables us to give you the best possible
service and minimize the possibility that out of date information may be used to make a decision which impacts you. Allowing us to share your information
within TD Bank Financial Group means that,
in some circumstances, updates to your
information can be made once and be effective
for all the products and services you have
with TD Bank Financial Group.

</p><p>
We have policies and procedures to help us maintain the accuracy of your information. For most updates, we rely on you for information. You can help by keeping us informed of any changes, such as if you move or change
telephone numbers. If you find any errors in
our information about you, let us know and
we will make the corrections immediately,
and make sure they are conveyed to anyone
we may have misinformed. For information

<i><p>We will explain your options of refusing or
withdrawing consent to the collection, use
or release of your information, and, given reasonable notice, we
will record and respect your choices.

</p></i>

<p>In most cases you are free to refuse or
withdraw your consent at any time. You
may do so by contacting the branch or office
where your account is held or by calling us at
1-800-430-6095. Our staff will be pleased to
explain your options and any consequences
of refusing or withdrawing your consent,
and record your choices.
</p><p>
There are several privacy preferences
available to you, subject to legal, business or
contractual requirements. If you prefer, you
may choose not to have us -
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><b> Use your Social Insurance Number with
credit reporting agencies as an aid to
identify you</b>
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Conduct a credit check in order to
assess an application for credit</b><br>
In doing so, however, we may not be able
to extend credit services to you. Once you
have a credit product with us, we will share
your credit experience on an ongoing basis
with other lenders and credit reporting
agencies. You cannot withdraw your consent
for this sharing of information as it is
necessary to support the credit process.
<p>
</p></li><li><b> Contact you occasionally either by mail,
telephone, or email, or all of these
methods, with direct marketing offers
that may be of benefit to you</b><br>
This does not include messages or other
information about promotional offers we
provide on, or enclosed with, your written
or electronic account statements, or that we
may discuss while talking with you. Any
marketing campaigns that are already
underway may not immediately take your
preferences into account.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Share your financial and account
information with other members of
TD Bank Financial Group</b><br>
This does not apply if you have
requested a product or service that is
jointly offered by more than one
member of TD Bank Financial Group.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Contact you to participate in customer
research and surveys</b>
</li></ul>

a request for information was handled, we encourage you
to let us know, and you can take the following actions. If you choose
to mail, fax or email us, please include your
full name, address and telephone number.


</i></p>

<p><font class="sectionhead">STEP 1<br>
Contact us in one of the following ways:</font>

			</p><ul>
				<li> Speak to a Customer Service Representative at your branch or business unit
				</li><li><b>Telephone:</b> Call <nobr>1-800-430-6095</nobr> at any time
				</li><li><b>Mail:</b> Customer Feedback<br>

			</li></ul>
			
<p>We'll work hard to provide an acceptable
solution but if you are not satisfied, the
Manager will become involved in the
resolution of your problem or concern.
</p>
	     
<p><font class="sectionhead">STEP 2<br>
Elevation to a Senior Officer</font>

</p><p>If you are not satisfied with the solution you
receive from the Manager in Step 1, the
Manager will offer to elevate your problem -
communicating all relevant details on your
behalf - to a representative of the Senior
Management Officer responsible for the
branch or business unit. If you prefer to
elevate the problem yourself, the Manager
will provide you with the contact information.
You may also speak with one of our Telephone
Banking Specialists at 1-800-430-6095 to
arrange to have the appropriate representative
contact you. If you are not satisfied with the
solution the representative provides, a Senior
Management Officer will become involved.


</p><p><font class="sectionhead">STEP 3<br>
Contact the TD Ombudsman</font>

</p><p>If your problem or concern remains unresolved
after Steps 1 and 2, you may contact the
<nobr>TD Ombudsman.</nobr> If it is determined that your
problem has not been addressed by the Senior
Management Officer as described in Step 2,
then the <nobr>TD Ombudsman</nobr> may direct your
problem to the appropriate business area for
investigation and response. Within five days of
receiving your enquiry, the <nobr>TD Ombudsman</nobr>
will write or call to advise you of the actions
being taken. You may contact the
<nobr>TD Ombudsman</nobr> by:

</p><p>Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality
of your personal information has always
been fundamental to the way we do business
with you within TD Bank Financial Group,
whether over the Internet, on the telephone
or at our branches and offices.
</p><p>
We developed our Privacy Code brochure
to inform you of our policy on privacy and
tell you about the ways we ensure that your
privacy and the confidentiality of your
information are protected.
</p><p>
Many of you have questions about how we
are handling the information we obtain from
you when you visit our websites. This online
privacy policy will answer your questions
about the information we collect when you
visit a TD Bank Financial Group website,
and how we use it.
</p>

<p><a name="100"><font class="sectionhead">Visiting our information sites</font></a>

</p><p>When you go directly to the information
portion of our websites and move from page
to page, read pages or download content onto
your computer, we learn which pages are
visited, what content is downloaded, and
the address of websites that you visited
immediately before coming to our websites.
However, none of this is associated with you as
an individual. It is measured only in aggregate.
</p><p>
We use this information to find out how
many people visit our websites and which
sections of the sites are visited most
frequently. This helps us to know what type of
information is most useful to you so that we
can improve our websites and make it easier
for you to access information. We record the
statistical information on the numbers of
visitors to our websites, but no information
about you in particular will be kept or used.

<p><a name="200"><font class="sectionhead">Using our Internet transaction services</font></a>

</p><p>When you register for one of our Internet
transaction services, such as EasyWeb,
we compile a profile of you for that service
(e.g. name, address, account numbers,
login ID, etc.). Each time you use our
Internet services, we collect your login ID,
information about the transactions that you
complete and the informational pages of the
web that you visit while using the service.
</p><p>
We use your profile in responding to your
enquiries on the service. We use your login
ID to identify you as a user of the service.
We use the transaction information in the
aggregate to assess and improve the service.
</p><p>
We use specific transaction information
for servicing purposes (e.g. billing).
We use both your transaction information
and the informational pages of the website
that you have visited to determine your
financial needs so that we can offer other
TD Bank Financial Group products and
services to you.

<p><a name="300"><font class="sectionhead">Cookies</font></a>
			
</p><p>A cookie is a small file containing certain
pieces of information that a website creates
when you visit the site. It can track how and
when you use a site, which site you visited
immediately before, and it can store that
information about you.
</p><p>
There are two common types of cookies,
"session cookies" and "persistent cookies".
Session cookies store information only for
the length of time that you are connected to
a website - they are not written onto your
hard drive. Once you leave the website, the
originator of the cookie no longer has the
information that was contained on it.
</p><p>
TD Bank Financial Group uses session
cookies as an additional security feature
for its online services. For example,
when you login to any web service and
are authenticated through your login ID
and password, a cookie will store the
identification number of your browser.
Throughout your session, the cookie acts
as a type of digital signature to identify
your current session to the web server.
</p><p>
We also use session cookies to track your
visits within our site. We use that information
to determine the type of information that you
are looking for in our site and to improve our
site. We use information about the site you
visited immediately prior to our site to assess
the viability of links to our site that we have
created on third party sites.

</p><p>
The information stored in "persistent
cookies" is written onto your hard drive
and remains there until the expiry date of
the cookie. TD Bank Financial Group uses
persistent cookies to store non-sensitive
information that you are aware of and have
agreed to. For example, if you choose the
option on our login screen to remember your
TD Canada Trust Access Card number or
Connect ID for EasyWeb or WebBroker*,
the system will remember and automatically
input your Access Card number or Connect
ID each time you use the service from that PC.
</p><p>
EasyWeb Internet banking also employs two
additional "persistent" cookies, designed to
deliver a more comfortable online banking
experience to you. The first is placed on
your computer's hard drive to remember
your language preference and ensure you
are always presented with EasyWeb Internet
banking in the appropriate language. The
second is employed to ensure that any online
targeted offer which you have already
responded to is not presented again each
time you login to EasyWeb Internet banking.
</p><p>
All persistent cookies used by EasyWeb
Internet banking are encrypted for
additional security.
</p><p>
Currently, most browsers do not distinguish
between session cookies and persistent cookies.
For web services to operate, your browser
must be set to accept cookies. If you are
concerned about having your browser
enabled to accept cookies while you are
surfing other websites, we recommend that
you enable your browser to notify you when
it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the
ability of accepting or rejecting any cookie
presented by the web server you are visiting.

<p><a name="400"><font class="sectionhead">Email comments, questions or responses</font></a>
			
</p><p>When you send us an email or when you ask
us to respond to you by email, we learn your
exact email address and any information you
have included in the email.
</p><p>
We use your email address to acknowledge
your comments and/or reply to your
questions, and we will store your
communication and our reply in case
we correspond further. We will not sell
your email address to anyone outside
TD Bank Financial Group. We may use
your email address to send you information
about offers on products and services that
we believe may be of interest to you. If you
don't want us to contact you by email with
offers on products and services, you may
tell us so at any time.
</p><p>
If you have asked us to put you on an email
mailing list to provide you with certain
information on a regular basis, or if we send
you information about our offers on products
and services by email, you may ask us to
remove you from the list at any time (using the
unsubscribe instructions provided with each
email and on the site where you signed up).
</p><p>
<b>Remember</b> that email sent over the
Internet is generally unencrypted. If
TD Bank Financial Group requests that you
transmit confidential information to us over
the Internet when filling out an application
online, we ensure that such transmission
is encrypted. We recommend that you use
caution when forwarding free-format email
messages to us and that you do not include
confidential information (such as account
numbers) in those messages, as they are
not encrypted.
</p><p>
<b>Important Information About Preventing
Email Fraud:</b> From time to time, fraudulent
emails may be circulated to you claiming to
have been issued by Canadian banks,
requesting customers to verify their personal
and/or banking information. Customers are
often asked to click on a link in the email that
directs them to a pop-up window or modified
online banking login page to enter their
respective bank's login ID and password.
</p><p>
<b>We will never send email messages to
customers requesting confidential
information such as passwords or account
numbers. Please do not act on any such
emails as you may compromise your
banking information by following links to a
counterfeit Internet site(s).</b>

</p><p>When you submit your answers to a game or
contest or submit your response to a survey
question, we learn your answer or any
opinions or information that you volunteer.
</p><p>
We will use your submission for the purpose
of awarding a prize in a contest. We use your
submission to come up with the game or
survey results, and we may publish those
results in aggregate on our websites. We
may use your response to improve our
website or other products or services of
TD Bank Financial Group. Based on your
response, we may forward information
about our offers on products and services
that we believe may be of interest to you.
