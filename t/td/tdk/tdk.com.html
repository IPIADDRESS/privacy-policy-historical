  <p><b>Privacy Statement Version 2.1<br>
    Last Updated August 2001</b><br>
    <br>

    privacy. We've structured our Web sites so that, in general, you can visit 
    TDK on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. 
    This Privacy Statement reflects both the policies of TDK.com and TDKeStore.com. 
  </p>
  <p>The TDK eStore is operated by TDK Online Services Corporation, which is a 
    wholly owned subsidiary of TDK Electronics Corporation. TDK eStore understands 
    that online security is paramount to our customers and visitors and takes

    the eStore. </p>
  <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and we use the 
    information that we collect in order to facilitate the process or orders and 
    to provide a more personalized shopping experience. </p>
  <p>Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information 
    by which you can be identified), it will be used to support your customer 
    relationship with TDK. </p>
  <p><b>Awareness</b></p>
  <p> TDK provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy

    us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, 
    experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. You are 
    at no time under any obligation to provide this information and any information 
    collected will be used for internal marketing analysis and communications 
    to you regarding product information and product upgrades. Data collected 
    online may also be combined with information you provide when you register 
    your ownership of TDK products. </p>
  <p>The TDK eStore also allows you to make purchases. The types of personal information 
    collected at these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction 
    information and credit card information. The TDK eStore will track consumer

    A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created 
    by other web sites. A cookie will not corrupt your hard drive or transmit 
    a virus to your computer. </p>
  <p><b>Choice of Contact Methods</b></p>
