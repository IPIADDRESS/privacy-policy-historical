			</p><p>We strive to provide you with the best customer service. To us, that

	   	   	</p><p><a name="b"><font class="pageTitleB">Our privacy policy</font></a></p>
			
Our privacy policy applies to personal customers, including individuals carrying on business alone or in partnership with other individuals. It consists of five key principles:

	     	<p><font class="sectionhead">1. Collecting and using information</font></p>
	      	<p>Either before or when we collect information about you, we will explain how we intend to use it. We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes, and we will use it only for those purposes. We will obtain your consent if we wish to use your information for any other purpose and before collecting information from third parties such as credit bureaus.


	      	</p><p><font class="sectionhead">2. Releasing information</font></p>
	      	<p>We may provide your information to other persons:
			</p><ul>
				<li> where we have your consent
	      		</li><li> where the other parties are our suppliers or agents who assist us in serving you
	      		</li><li> where we are required or permitted to do so by law
				</li><li> where transfers of a business are involved
			</li></ul>

			
	      	<p><font class="sectionhead">3. Protecting information</font></p>
	      	<p>We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures. We will retain your information only for the time it is required for the purposes we explain.</p>


	      	<p><font class="sectionhead">4. Providing information access and accuracy</font> We will give you access to the information we retain about you. We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and <nobr>up-to-date.</nobr></p>


	      	<p><font class="sectionhead">5. Respecting and responding to your privacy concerns</font></p>
	      	<p>In this Privacy Code, we will explain your options for refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use and release of your information, and we will record and respect your choices. We will investigate and respond to your concerns about any aspect of our handling of your information. In this Privacy Code, we will explain how we fulfill each of these important principles.</p>

	      	</p><p><a name="c"><font class="pageTitleB">Why we ask for your information</font></a></p>
		  	<p><em>We ask you for information to establish and serve you as our customer.</em>

		  	</p><p>We obtain most of our information about you directly from you. The information we ask for depends on which product or service you want. For every product or service, we need your name, address and some identification. Here is why we need some of the other information we ask you to provide.

	      	</p><p>• <font class="sectionhead">Birth date</font></p>
	      	<p>This helps us identify you and ensure that no one is trying to impersonate you. We may also use it to determine your eligibility for products and services that may be of benefit to a particular age group.</p>

	      	<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Social Insurance Number (SIN)</font></p>
	     	<p>Your SIN is required for products which earn investment income, in order to comply
with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency's income reporting requirements. Providing your SIN for credit products is optional. If you provide your SIN, we also use it to keep your information separate from that of other customers with a similar name, including information we obtain with your consent through the credit approval process.</p>

	      	<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Financial information</font></p>
	      	<p>This is used to assess your eligibility for any credit product, for example, a TD Visa* card, line of credit or other loan. We also use it to ensure that the advice we give you or the investments you purchase (in the case of mutual funds or brokerage or investment accounts) are appropriate for you.</p>

	      	<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Health information</font></p>
	      	<p>This is required for some insurance products to ensure you are eligible for coverage. We only collect the information we need and only use it for the purposes explained to you. When you apply for a new product or service, we will indicate in the application or agreement how we intend to use your information. If we wish in the future to use it for another purpose, we will ask you for your consent at that time. We will only ask for the information we need for that particular product or service. We will indicate clearly which information would help us to serve you but is optional for you to provide.</p>
	      
		  	<p></p><div align="right"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>
<p>		  


		  
	      	</p><p><a name="d"><font class="pageTitleB">Serving you better</font></a></p>
	      
		  	<p><em>With your consent, we may share your information within TD Bank Financial Group.
This will help us serve you better and determine whether any products or services of TD Bank Financial Group are suitable for you so that we can offer them to you.</em>

			</p><p>We want to serve you better and meet your customer service expectations. Agreeing to let us share your information within TD Bank Financial Group helps us to meet this goal.</p>

	      	<p>It lets us instantly recognize your total relationship with TD Bank Financial Group, no matter when or where you contact us or which one of us you contact. It also means that changes to your information, such as updated addresses or telephone numbers, can be made once and be effective for all your products or services with TD Bank Financial Group.

			</p><p>Sharing your information also helps us determine your financial needs because it allows us to review what TD Bank Financial Group products you have and how you use them. We may then offer you other TD Bank Financial Group products and services - including special promotions - that we believe will be of interest to you.

			</p><p>Please note that health information that may have been provided in connection with an insurance product is never shared. This consent is optional and you can decide to withdraw it at any time. Please refer to the  <a href="#j">"Respecting your preference"</a> section (Page 10).</p>

<p>



		  	</p><p><a name="e"><font class="pageTitleB">Why we ask others for information about you</font></a></p>
			<p><em>With your consent, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including through a credit check.</em></p>

	      	<p>Obtaining additional information about you from parties outside TD Bank Financial Group helps us assess your eligibility for our products.</p>

	      	<p>For credit products, for example, we need to know your creditworthiness. For this reason, we may contact other lenders or credit bureaus to give us information on your credit history. We may also contact employers or other personal references to verify information that you have given us. We will not do this without your consent, but please remember that if you do not give your consent we may not be able to extend credit services to you.</p>
	      
		  
		  	<p></p><div align="right"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>
			<p>



	     	</p><p><a name="f"><font class="pageTitleB">When we release your information</font></a></p>
	     	<p>We are not in the business of selling customer lists or information to others. However, we may release your information to parties outside TD Bank Financial Group in certain circumstances, which include:</p>

	      	<p>• <font class="sectionhead">With your consent</font></p>
	      	<p>We will disclose your credit history with us to other lenders or credit bureaus in order to support the credit approval process. We release only the information required to identify you, as well as facts from our credit records about your repayment history.</p>

	      	<p>• <font class="sectionhead">For servicing purposes</font></p>
	      	<p>We give a limited amount of information, only as necessary, without your consent, to our suppliers and agents; for example, cheque printers and bank card manufacturers who provide goods and services to you through us.</p>

	      	<p>• <font class="sectionhead">When required or permitted by law</font></p>
	      	<p>We must give information in response to a valid demand, search warrant or other legally valid enquiry or order. We may disclose information to help us collect a debt owed to us by you. We may also disclose information to an investigative body in the case of a breach of agreement or contravention of law - this helps prevent fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity.</p>  
	      	<p>• <font class="sectionhead">Transfers of a business</font></p>
		  	<p>As TD Bank Financial Group continues to develop and grow, we may buy or sell parts
of our businesses. As our businesses consist primarily of our customer relationships, personal customer information and information regarding the particular account or service being purchased or sold would generally be one of the transferred business assets.

	      	<p><em>We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.</em></p>

	      	<p>We have thorough security standards to protect our systems and your information against unauthorized access and use.</p>

			<p>For example, our systems have been designed to ensure that your Personal Identification Number (PIN), password and other access codes are always private and confidential. When you use your PIN at an automated banking machine, it is scrambled after you enter it. For your protection, your access codes are known only to you - our employees cannot gain access to them and they will not ask you to reveal them.</p>

			<p>All our suppliers and agents, as part of their contracts with TD Bank Financial Group, are bound to maintain your confidentiality and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose.</p>

			<p>When we provide information in response to a legal enquiry or order, we ensure that the order is valid and we disclose only the information that is legally required.</p>

			<p>All employees of TD Bank Financial Group are familiar with the procedures that must be taken to safeguard customer information. And to us, protecting the confidentiality of your information is more than a procedure - it's part of our jobs. It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.</p>

			<p><em>We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure that they are being properly administered and that they remain effective and appropriate.</em></p>

			<p>We retain your information only as long as it is required for the reasons it was collected. The length of time we retain information varies depending on the product or service and the nature of the information. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us but only for so long as it is legally necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issue that may arise at a later date. When your information is no longer needed for the purposes explained to you, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form.</p>

			</p><p>Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way we do business with you within TD Bank Financial Group, whether over the Internet, on the telephone or at our branches and offices.</p>  
			
			<p>We developed our Privacy Code brochure to inform you of our policy on privacy and tell you about the ways we ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your information are protected.</p>
			
			<p>Many of you have questions about how we are handling the information we obtain from you when you visit our websites. This online privacy policy will answer your questions about the information we collect when you visit a TD Bank Financial Group website, and how we use it.</p>


			<p><a name="100"><font class="sectionhead">Visiting our information sites</font></a>

			</p><p>When you go directly to the information portion of our websites and move from page to page, read pages or download content onto your computer, we learn which pages are visited, what content is downloaded, and the address of websites that you visited immediately before coming to our websites. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate.</p>

			<p>We use this information to find out how many people visit our websites and which sections of the sites are visited most frequently. This helps us to know what type of information is most useful to you so that we can improve our websites and make it easier for you to access information. We record the statistical information on the numbers of visitors to our websites, but no information about you in particular will be kept or used.</p>

			</p><p><a name="200"><font class="sectionhead">Using our Internet transaction services</font></a>

			</p><p>When you register for one of our Internet transaction services, such as EasyWeb, we compile a profile of you for that service (e.g. name, address, account numbers, login ID, etc.). Each time you use our Internet services, we collect your login ID, information about the transactions that you complete and the informational pages of the web that you visit while using the service.</p>

			<p>We use your profile in responding to your enquires on the service. We use your login ID to identify you as a user of the service. We use the transaction information in the aggregate to assess and improve the service. We use specific transaction information for servicing purposes (e.g. billing).</p>

			<p>We use both your transaction information and the informational pages of the web that you have visited to determine your financial needs so that we can offer other TD Bank Financial Group products and services to you.</p>

			</p><p><a name="300"><font class="sectionhead">Cookies</font></a>
			
			</p><p>A cookie is a small file containing certain pieces of information that a website creates when you visit the site. It can track how and when you use a site, which site you visited immediately before, and it can store that information about you.</p>

			<p>There are two common types of cookies, "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". Session cookies store information only for the length of time that you are connected to a website - they are not written onto your hard drive. Once you leave the website, the originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on it.</p>

			<p>TD Bank Financial Group uses session cookies as an additional security feature for its online services. For example, when you login to any web service and are authenticated through your login ID and password, a cookie will store the identification number of your browser. Throughout your session, the cookie acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session to the web server.</p>

			<p>We also use session cookies to track your visits within our site. We use that information to determine the type of information that you are looking for in our site and to improve our site. We use information about the site you visited immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to our site that we have created on third party sites.</p>

			<p>The information stored in "persistent cookies" is written onto your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. TD Bank Financial Group uses persistent cookies to store non-sensitive information that you are aware of and have agreed to. For example, if you choose the option on our login screen to remember your TD Canada Trust Access Card<sup><font class="footer">TM</font></sup> number or Connect ID for EasyWeb or WebBroker*, the system will remember and automatically input your Access Card number or Connect ID each time you use the service from that PC.</p>

			<p>Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies and persistent cookies. For web services to operate, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you are concerned about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are surfing other websites, we recommend that you enable your browser to notify you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the ability of accepting or rejecting any cookie presented by the web server you are visiting.</p>

			<p>We use your email address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. We will not sell your email address to anyone outside TD Bank Financial Group. We may use your email address to send you information about offers on products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you don't want us to contact you by email with offers on products and services, you maytell us so at any time.</p>

			<p>If you have asked us to put you on an email mailing list to provide you with certain information on a regular basis, or if we send you information about our offers on products and services by email, you may ask us to remove you from the list at any time (using the unsubscribe instructions provided with each email and on the site where you signed up).</p>

			<p><strong>Remember</strong> that email sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted. If TD Bank Financial Group requests that you transmit confidential information to us over the Internet when filling out an application online, we ensure that such transmission is encrypted. We recommend that you use caution when forwarding free-format email messages to us and that you do not include confidential information (such as account numbers) in those messages, as they are not encrypted.</p>
