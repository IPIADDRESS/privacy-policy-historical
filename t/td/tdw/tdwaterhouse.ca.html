<font class="sectionhead">The TD Bank Financial Group commitment to privacy</font>

</p><p>
Protecting your privacy and the
confidentiality of your personal
information has always been
fundamental to the way we do
business within TD Bank
Financial Group <sup>®1</sup>.
</p><p>
We strive to provide you with the
best customer service. To us, that
includes treating you fairly and
with respect.
</p><p>
This Privacy Code informs you of
our policy on privacy, and tells you
about the ways we ensure that your
privacy and the confidentiality of
your information are protected.
</p><p>

</p><p></p><div align="right"><a href="#top"><font class="footer">Top</font> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>
<p>

	      </p><p><a name="b"><font class="sectionhead">Our privacy policy</font></a></p>
	  <p>   

Our privacy policy applies to personal
customers, including individuals carrying on
business alone or in partnership with other
individuals. It consists of five key principles:

	      </p><p><font class="sectionsubhead">1. Collecting and using information</font></p>
	      <p>
Either before or when we collect information
about you, we will explain how we intend
to use it. We will limit the information we
collect to what we need for those purposes,
and we will use it only for those purposes.
We will obtain your consent if we wish to
use your information for any other purpose
and before collecting information from
third parties such as credit bureaus.
</p>
	      <p><font class="sectionsubhead">2. Releasing information</font></p>
	      <p>We may provide your information to
other persons:
</p><ul type="disc">
<li> where we have your consent
</li><li> where the other parties are our suppliers
or agents who assist us in serving you
</li><li> where we are required or permitted to
do so by law
</li><li> where transfers of a business
are involved
</li></ul>


	<p><font class="sectionsubhead">3. Protecting information</font></p>
	      <p>
		  We will protect your information with
appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We will retain your information only for the
time it is required for the purposes we explain.

	      </p><p><font class="sectionsubhead">4. Providing information access
and accuracy</font></p>
		  <p>We will give you access to the information
we retain about you. We will make every
reasonable effort to keep your information
accurate and up-to-date.




	      </p><p><font class="sectionsubhead">5. Respecting and responding to
your privacy concerns</font></p>
	      <p>In this Privacy Code we will explain your
options of refusing or withdrawing consent
to the collection, use and release of your
information, and we will record and respect
your choices. We will investigate and
respond to your concerns about any aspect
of our handling of your information.
</p><p>
In this Privacy Code we will explain how
we fulfill each of these important principles.

<p>
	      </p><p><a name="c"><font class="sectionhead">Why we ask for your
information</font></a></p>
		  <p>
	      <i>We ask you for information to establish and
serve you as our customer.</i>
</p><p class="decisionPage">
We obtain most of our information about
you directly from you. The information we
ask for depends on which product or service
you want. For every product or service, we
need your name, address and some
identification. Here is why we need some of
the other information we ask you to provide.

</p><p>• <font class="sectionsubhead">Birth date</font></p>
	      <p>This helps us identify you and ensure that
no one is trying to impersonate you. We
may also use it to determine your eligibility
for products and services that may be of
benefit to a particular age group.</p>


	      <p>• <font class="sectionsubhead">Social Insurance Number (SIN)</font></p>
	      <p>Your SIN is required for products which
earn investment income, in order to comply
with the Canada Customs and Revenue
Agency’s income reporting requirements.
Providing your SIN for credit products is
optional. If you provide your SIN, we also
use it to keep your information separate from
that of other customers with a similar name,
including information we obtain with your
consent through the credit approval process.</p>


	      <p>•<font class="sectionsubhead"> Financial information</font></p>
	      <p>This is used to assess your eligibility for
any credit product, for example, a
TD Visa<sup>*</sup> card, line of credit or other loan.
We also use it to ensure that the advice we
give you or the investments you purchase
(in the case of mutual funds or brokerage
or investment accounts) are appropriate
for you.</p>

	      <p>• <font class="sectionsubhead">Health information</font></p>
	      <p>
This is required for some insurance
products to ensure you are eligible
for coverage.
		  </p><p>

<i>We only collect the information we need
and only use it for the purposes explained
to you.</i>
</p><p>
When you apply for a new product or
service, we will indicate in the application
or agreement how we intend to use your
information. If we wish in the future to
use it for another purpose, we will ask you
for your consent at that time. We will only
ask for the information we need for that
particular product or service. We will
indicate clearly which information would
help us to serve you but is optional for you
to provide.</p>
	      
	      
		  <p></p><div align="right"><a href="#top"><font class="footer">Top</font> <img src="/images/red4.gif" width="9" height="13" alt="" border="0"></a></div>

	      </p><p><a name="d"><font class="sectionhead">Serving you better</font></a></p>
	      
		  <p>
<i>With your consent, we may share your
information within <nobr>TD Bank</nobr> Financial
Group. This will help us serve you better and
determine whether any products or services
of TD Bank Financial Group are suitable
for you so that we can offer them to you.</i>
</p><p>
We want to serve you better and meet your
customer service expectations. Agreeing
to let us share your information within
TD Bank Financial Group helps us to
meet this goal.
</p><p>
It lets us instantly recognize your total
relationship with TD Bank Financial Group,
no matter when or where you contact us or
which one of us you contact. It also means
that changes to your information, such as
updated addresses or telephone numbers,
can be made once and be effective for all
your products or services with TD Bank
Financial Group.
</p><p>
Sharing your information also helps us
determine your financial needs because it
allows us to review what TD Bank Financial
Group products you have and how you use
them. We may then offer you other TD Bank
Financial Group products and services -including
special promotions - that we
believe will be of interest to you.
</p><p>
<i>Please note that health information that may
have been provided in connection with an
insurance product is never shared.</i>
</p><p>
This consent is optional and you can decide
to withdraw it at any time. Please refer to the
<a href="#j">“Respecting your preference” </a>section.

Why we ask others for
information about you</font></a></p>

	   
<i>With your consent, we may obtain
information about you from third parties,
including through a credit check.</i>
<p>
Obtaining additional information about
you from parties outside TD Bank Financial
Group helps us assess your eligibility for
our products.
</p><p>
For credit products, for example, we need
to know your creditworthiness. For this
reason, we may contact other lenders or
credit bureaus to give us information on
your credit history. We may also contact
employers or other personal references to
verify information that you have given us.
We will not do this without your consent,
but please remember that if you do not give
your consent we may not be able to extend
credit services to you.

<p>

	      </p><p><a name="f"><font class="sectionhead">When we release your information</font></a></p>

	      <p>
<i>We are not in the business of selling customer
lists or information to others. However, we
may release your information to parties
outside TD Bank Financial Group in
certain circumstances, which include:</i></p>


	      <p>•<font class="sectionsubhead"> With your consent</font></p>
	      <p>We will disclose your credit history with
us to other lenders or credit bureaus in
order to support the credit approval process.
We release only the information required
to identify you, as well as facts from our
credit records about your repayment history.</p>
	      <p>•<font class="sectionsubhead"> For servicing purposes</font></p>
	      <p>We give a limited amount of information,
only as necessary, without your consent,
to our suppliers and agents; for example,
cheque printers and bank card manufacturers
who provide goods and services to you
through us.</p>
	      <p>•<font class="sectionsubhead"> When required or permitted by law</font></p>
	      <p>We must give information in response to
a valid demand, search warrant or other
legally valid enquiry or order. We may
disclose information to help us collect
a debt owed to us by you. We may also
disclose information to an investigative
body in the case of a breach of agreement
or contravention of law – this helps
prevent fraud, money laundering or other
criminal activity.
</p>  
 <p>•<font class="sectionsubhead"> Transfers of a business</font></p>
<p>As TD Bank Financial Group continues
to develop and grow, we may buy or
sell parts of our businesses. As our
businesses consist primarily of our
customer relationships, personal customer
information and information regarding
the particular account or service being
purchased or sold would generally be
one of the transferred business assets.

<p>
		  
	      </p><p><a name="g"><font class="sectionhead">How we protect your information</font></a></p>
		 
	      <p> 
	<i>We will protect your information with
appropriate safeguards and security measures.</i>
</p><p>
We have thorough security standards to
protect our systems and your information
against unauthorized access and use.
</p><p>
For example, our systems have been designed
to ensure that your Personal Identification
Number (PIN), password and other access
codes are always private and confidential.
</p><p>

When you use your PIN at an automated
banking machine, it is scrambled after you
enter it. For your protection, your access
codes are known only to you - our employees
cannot gain access to them and they will
not ask you to reveal them.
</p><p>
All our suppliers and agents, as part of their
contracts with <nobr>TD Bank</nobr> Financial Group,
are bound to maintain your confidentiality
and may not use the information for any
unauthorized purpose.
</p><p>
When we provide information in response
to a legal enquiry or order, we ensure that
the order is valid and we disclose only the
information that is legally required.
</p><p>
All employees of TD Bank Financial Group
are familiar with the procedures that must
be taken to safeguard customer information.
And to us, protecting the confidentiality of
your information is more than a procedure -it’s
part of our jobs. It is specified in our
employment agreements and regularly
confirmed in writing.
</p><p>


We audit our procedures and security
measures regularly to ensure that they are
being properly administered and that they
remain effective and appropriate.
</p><p>
<i>We retain your information only as long as
it is required for the reasons it was collected.</i>
</p><p>
The length of time we retain information
varies depending on the product or service
and the nature of the information. This
period may extend beyond the end of your
relationship with us but only for so long as
it is legally necessary for us to have sufficient
information to respond to any issue that may
arise at a later date. When your information
is no longer needed for the purposes explained
to you, we have procedures to destroy, delete,
erase or convert it to an anonymous form.

<p>
	     <i>We will give you access to the information
we have about you.</i>
</p><p>
Most of this information is in the form of
your transaction records. These are available
to you through your account statements or
passbook updates, by visiting the branch or
office where your account is held, or by
accessing your account through our
EasyWeb™ Internet banking, EasyLine™ telephone banking, Wireless banking,
Green Machine<sup>®</sup> automated banking
machines, and brokerage services.
</p><p>If you require other information, simply
contact the branch or office where your
account is held. We will ask you for specific
details such as branch and account number.
We will advise you in advance if a minimal
charge will be required for conducting the
search, and we will respond to your request
within 30 days.
</p><p>
Please note that we may not be able to
provide information about you from our
records which contains references to other
persons which is subject to legal privilege,
contains confidential information proprietary
to TD Bank Financial Group, relates to an
investigation of a breach of agreement or
contravention of laws, or cannot be disclosed
for other legal reasons. Also, we do not
maintain disclosure records for regular or
routine actions such as T5 or other reports
to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency,
regular updating of credit information
to credit bureaus, or account balance
deficiencies through the return of NSF items.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions regarding decisions
made about you, we will tell you the reasons
for those decisions. Where relevant, we
will provide you with the name and address
of the credit bureau from which a report
was obtained.

<i>We will make every reasonable effort to keep
your information accurate and up-to-date.</i>
<p>
Having accurate information about you
enables us to give you the best possible
service. Allowing us to share your
information within TD Bank Financial
Group means updates to your information
can be made once and be effective for all
the products and services you have with
TD Bank Financial Group.
</p><p>
You can help by keeping us informed of
any changes, such as if you move or change
telephone numbers. If you find any errors in
our information about you, let us know and
we will make the corrections immediately,
and make sure they are conveyed to anyone
we may have misinformed. For information
that remains in dispute, we will note your
opinion in the file.

<i>We will explain your options of refusing or

</p><p>
In most cases you are free to refuse or
withdraw your consent at any time. You may
do so by contacting the branch or office where your account is held or by calling us
at 1-800-430-6095. Our staff will be
pleased to explain your options and any
consequences of refusing or withdrawing
your consent, and record your choices.
</p><p>
If you don’t want us to share information
within TD Bank Financial Group or contact
you with product information, you can
tell us so at any time. You can choose, for
instance, not to receive centralized direct
mail or telephone marketing, or to receive
information only for certain products. Our
staff will guide you through the numerous
choices. You will continue to receive
product brochures and messages included
in account statements.
</p><p>
You can change your options at any time.
You may refuse consent for us to do a credit
check, but we may not be able to extend
credit services to you. Once you have a
credit product, you may not withdraw your
consent to share your credit experience
with other lenders and credit bureaus, as
this is necessary to support the credit
approval process.

Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality
of your personal information has always
been fundamental to the way we do business
with you within TD Bank Financial Group,
whether over the Internet, on the telephone
or at our branches and offices.
</p><p>
We developed our Privacy Code brochure
to inform you of our policy on privacy and
tell you about the ways we ensure that your
privacy and the confidentiality of your
information are protected.
</p><p>
Many of you have questions about how
we are handling the information we obtain
from you when you visit our websites.
This online privacy policy will answer your
questions about the information we collect
when you visit a TD Bank Financial Group
website, and how we use it.


</p><p><a name="100"><font class="sectionhead">Visiting our information sites</font></a>

</p><p>When you go directly to the information
portion of our websites and move from
page to page, read pages or download
content onto your computer, we learn which
pages are visited, what content is
downloaded, and the address of websites
that you visited immediately before coming
to our websites. However, none of this
is associated with you as an individual.
It is measured only in aggregate.
</p><p>
We use this information to find out how
many people visit our websites and which
sections of the sites are visited most
frequently. This helps us to know what type
of information is most useful to you so that 
we can improve our websites and make it
easier for you to access information. We
record the statistical information on the
numbers of visitors to our websites, but no
information about you in particular will be
kept or used.

</p><p><a name="200"><font class="sectionhead">Using our Internet transaction services</font></a>

</p><p>
When you register for one of our Internet
transaction services, such as EasyWeb,
we compile a profile of you for that service
(e.g. name, address, account numbers,
login ID, etc.). Each time you use our
Internet services, we collect your login ID,
information about the transactions that
you complete and the informational
pages of the web that you visit while
using the service.
</p><p>

We use your profile in responding to your
enquires on the service. We use your login
ID to identify you as a user of the service.
We use the transaction information in the
aggregate to assess and improve the service.
We use specific transaction information for
servicing purposes (e.g. billing). We use
both your transaction information and the
informational pages of the web that you have
visited to determine your financial needs
so that we can offer other TD Bank
Financial Group products and services to you.

There are two common types of cookies,

Session cookies store information only for

TD Bank Financial Group uses session

for its online services. For example,
when you login to any web service and

Throughout your session, the cookie acts as
a type of digital signature to identify your
current session to the web server.
