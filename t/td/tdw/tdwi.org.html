            The information we collect is gathered from several sources. These 
            include our websites, conferences, product subscriptions and survey 
            information via telephone, e-mail, and direct mail. For each visitor 
            to our websites, our web server automatically recognizes only the 
            visitor’s domain name and IP address, but not the e-mail address. 
            In addition, we collect aggregate information on what web pages visitors 
            access or visit, and information volunteered by the visitor, such 
            as survey information, and/or site registrations. We collect postal 
            addresses, e-mail addresses, and/or telephone numbers of visitors 
            who post messages to our bulletin boards, make postings to our websites, 
            and/or voluntarily subscribe to our print or digital magazines and/or 
            e-mail newsletters. In addition, we collect information from our conferences 
            (e.g., attendees, exhibitors, speakers).<p></p> <p><a name="howweuse"></a>
            </p><div class="hdsubb">How We Use Collected Information</div>
            The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web 
            pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual 
            visitor, and/or to notify visitors about updates to our website. As 
            part of a subscription and/or registration agreement, subscribers 
            and conference registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, 
            and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription and/or 
            registration. Subscribers will be contacted for renewal, re-qualification, 
            surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers 
            related to their subscription and/or registration. We also use the 
            information to contact them for marketing purposes and share it with 
            other reputable organizations to allow them to contact our subscribers/registrants 
            for pre-screened marketing purposes. We do share non-personal, aggregate 
            statistics about our members, sales, demographics, traffic patterns, 
            and related website and product information with advertisers and reputable 
            third party vendors for marketing and promotional purposes; however, 
            none of the information we disclose in this aggregate form can be 
            used to personally identify you. Certain information — such 
            as your password and credit card number — is never disclosed 
            in any form whatsoever to any outside party.
