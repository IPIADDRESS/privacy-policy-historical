In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this website ("Site") and how we carry out data processing practices through the use of the Internet and any other electronic communications networks. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us or how we may use and protect it in the future.</p>
<p>By registering for any services on this Site or by providing any information to us, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information under the terms of this policy.</p>
<h2>Information That We Collect From You</h2>
<p>In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web server collects the IP address. In addition, there are parts of this Site where personal information may need to be collected from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request, or where requested to register you to, for example, our Journey Check Alerts Service, or to enable you to use our online ticket purchasing service. This is done through the use of online forms and every time you email us or provide us with your details in other ways (i.e. over the telephone, by fax, by mail etc.).The information collected from you may include but is not limited to:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>your name, address, landline or mobile telephone numbers, fax number and e-mail address; </li>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>offer contests and other promotional activities that may require online registration. Persons wishing to participate in those activities will be asked to provide certain personal information.

Cookies are read only by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
