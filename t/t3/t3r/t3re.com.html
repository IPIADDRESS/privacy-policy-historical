	<h2>Privacy Policy </h2>  <p><b>(Effective Date: October 1, 2015)</b></p>  <p>The website you are accessing (the "Site") is hosted by Constellation Web Solutions, Inc. DBA Market Leader on behalf of one of its real estate industry customers (the "Company").  Market Leader and Company are independent contractors and are not partners or otherwise engaged in any joint venture in delivering the Site. Notwithstanding that fact, this Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to both Market Leader and Company and as such, any reference to "we", "us" or "our" herein will apply equally to both Market Leader and Company. This Policy explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to your use of the Site, so you can make an informed decision about using the Site.</p>  <p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to the Policy, we will post a new statement on the Site and update the effective date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check the effective date of the Policy whenever you visit the Site to see if it has been updated since your last visit.</p>  <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>  <ul>  <li><b>Personal Information.</b> As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or e-mail address,), and information about that individual's location or activities or demographic information when such information is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.  This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</li>    <li><b>Collection.</b>  Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site.  We may collect the personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, when you fill out a form, send us an email, make a request, complete a   survey, register for certain services on the Site, or participate in certain activities on the Site, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number.  We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and preferences. Information we collect may be combined with information we obtained through other services we offer. We may collect information about your visit to the Site, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Site and services. We may also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. If we provide you with various services related to home selling and home buying (e.g., estimates of current market value of homes, moving costs, mortgage or finance costs, current home listings, neighborhood information, etc.), we may collect additional information related to such services.</li>  <li><b>Cookies and Web Beacons.</b>  We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or web beacons. Cookies are small pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's browser to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. We may use cookies to identify users, customize their experience on our site or to serve relevant ads.  If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personal information, we would treat this information as personal information.  We do not use Web beacons, or similar technology on the Site. However, we may permit third parties to place cookies or Web beacons on the Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising and for other lawful purposes.  A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug" or a "clear gif" is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site and user activity on the site. We do not use (or permit third parties to use) Web beacons to collect personally identifying information about you. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set to not accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or services.</li>    <li><b>Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons; Use of Third Party Ad Networks.</b> We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site.These third parties may place cookies, Web beacons or other devices on your computer to collect nonpersonal information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  For example, we may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on the Site.  Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.  In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.</li>  </ul>    <h3>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>  <p>We use personal information internally to serve users of the Site, to enhance and extend our relationship with Site users and to facilitate the use of, and administration and operation of, the Site.
