However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access or use certain features of this Site or T3Leads` services. T3Leads has no access to or control over third party Cookies technology.</p>
<p>CALIFORNIA DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE: Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, T3Leads’ information collection practices will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers or selected by you. However, you may be able to opt-out of being targeted by certain third-party marketers online at www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. If you wish to opt-out of receiving communications from T3Leads and/or third-party marketers, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the respective communications that are sent to you.</p>

<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>As a general rule, and other than in connection with the limited exceptions set forth below, T3Leads will not sell, share, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to or with others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, T3Leads may, from time to time, provide information submitted or collected on this Site to certain third-party administrative vendors for various reasons including, without limitation, billing, delivery, and payments.

<h2>Security of Information</h2>
<p>T3Leads employs a series of physical and electronic security measures and procedures to safeguard the security and integrity of your personal information from unauthorized access, use, destruction, or disclosure—both online and offline.
