<p><strong>3. How your Information is Collected</strong></p>
<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information You Provide.</p>
<p>We collect information you provide directly via the Services. For example, we collect information when you create an account, become a member, register for a race, class, or volunteer opportunity, make an online purchase, make a donation, respond to our surveys, enter promotions, or otherwise communicate or transact with us through the Services.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information Collected Automatically.</p>
<p>We automatically collect information about you when you access or use the Services (including when you interact with our website, e-mails, or advertisements). We use various technologies now and hereafter developed to collect this information including the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Log Files.</strong> Log files are files that record and store data about your use of the Services, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, and date/time stamps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web site and stored in the user’s web browser while that user is browsing that web site. When the user loads that web site, the browser sends the cookie back to the server to notify the web site of the user’s previous activity.&nbsp; Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use cookies to obtain and save information about the preferences of our users and the services they select. We also use cookies to help you navigate the Services and for security purposes to protect our users. For example, if a user is logged on and our Services are unused for an extended period of time, we may automatically log the user off. &nbsp;We also use cookies to bring you advertising both on and off the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”).</strong> Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages, e-mail messages, and advertisements. Web beacons are often used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, and to count content views. We may also incorporate web beacons or SDKs from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Services with your social media account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong> An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Device Fingerprinting.</strong> Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Location-identifying Technologies.</strong> GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>In-App Tracking Methods.</strong> When you download or use our mobile applications or access one of our unique mobile optimized websites we may receive information about your mobile device. There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.&nbsp; Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps.</p>
<p>For further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, please see Section 6 below.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information from Events.</p>

<p>NYRR’s Services may contain content from and links to other web sites and services owned and operated by third parties, including the site of the third party store, but we are not responsible for the privacy policies, terms of use, or content of any such third party services. These third parties may use tracking to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you.</p>
<p>We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and terms of use of third parties.&nbsp; You may provide information to other companies who provide content for various parts of our Services.&nbsp; If you provide information to such companies, however, that information will be subject to their privacy policies.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social Networking.</p>
<p>You also can engage with our Services though video, applications, and other offerings, on or through third party social networking sites, such as Facebook or third party social media plug-ins and applications.&nbsp; When you engage with our Services on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins and applications, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use, and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. You may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (for example, name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, your posts or ‘likes’) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application.&nbsp; We may combine information which we obtain directly through social networking sites or applications with information we obtain directly through the Services or from other sources.</p>
<p>When you allow us to access information from your social media account, it can enable us to do things like: (i) deliver exclusive content to you, (ii) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our applications or web sites, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly using your information.&nbsp; By engaging with our Services through social networking sites or applications, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with this Policy.&nbsp; Additionally, when you provide information in publicly visible areas of social networking sites or applications, it may be viewed by other members of these sites and we cannot prevent further use of the information.

<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.</p>
<p>We may use Google Analytics and other service providers for analytics services.&nbsp; These analytics services may use tracking technologies to help us analyze Services users and how they use the Services. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by these service providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Services, compiling statistic reports on the Services’ activity, and providing other services relating to Services activity and other internet usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We serve ads on and through third party services, such as Facebook and Google, that are targeted to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Services or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to the third party service or incorporating a pixel from the third party service on our Services, and the third party service matching common factors between our data and their data. To opt-out of receiving Matched Ads, please contact the applicable third party service. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such Facebook ads and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such third party service’s failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.</p>

<p>Data subjects located in Europe have additional rights set forth in the “Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe” section.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp; Children</strong></p>
<p>Our Services are directed to a general audience comprised primarily of adult users.&nbsp; Therefore, for most parts of the Services, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). To the extent that a child wants to participate in an Event, that child’s parent or legal guardian must register the child under the parent or legal guardian’s account and give consent to NYRR to collect and use the child’s personal information in compliance with COPPA, and other applicable laws.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe NYRR has collected such information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sitefeedback@nyrr.org">sitefeedback@nyrr.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Security</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be 100% secure and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you.&nbsp; You are responsible for keeping your password confidential.&nbsp; We ask you not to share your password with anyone.&nbsp; We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Services like message boards. Information that you make public, such as your profile information, will be accessible to others and you are solely responsible for it.</p>
<p><strong>10. Data Retention and Storage</strong></p>
<p>NYRR retains your information, including personal data, for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. For example, NYRR retains your information for business purposes, for as long as your account is active, and/or as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services. NYRR will also retain your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp; International Transfer</strong></p>
<p>We are based in the U.S. and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law.&nbsp; If you are accessing the Services from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Services may be transferred to, processed, stored and used in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.&nbsp; Data protection laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Services or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including personal data, in the U.S. as set forth in this Policy.&nbsp; If your data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses.</p>

You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Policy shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the County and State of New York, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any action and waive any claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum for such actions.</p>
<p><strong>13.&nbsp; Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time, and you should review this Policy carefully. If we update this Policy, your continued use of the Services following the posting of the revised Policy means that you accept and agree to the terms of the revised Policy. We will inform our users of changes to this Policy by posting such changes on our Services.&nbsp; However, if we are changing this Policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of information we previously advised would not be disclosed, we will contact our users to allow such users to prevent such disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>15. Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe</strong></p>
<p>A.&nbsp; &nbsp;Data Controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data protection laws in Europe make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NYRR generally acts as the controller of your information submitted to NYRR through our Services; however NYRR also in some instances will be engaged by a client for processing services.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; Lawful Basis for Processing.</p>
<p>Data protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given your consent to our processing for a specific purpose, either to us or to our service providers, or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to comply with a legal obligation; or (c) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by NYRR and fundamental rights do not override these interests.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Rights.</p>
<p>If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Services. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Services. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.</p>
<p>You may exercise your rights by submitting a written request to us at the address set forth in the “Contact Us” section. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.</p>
