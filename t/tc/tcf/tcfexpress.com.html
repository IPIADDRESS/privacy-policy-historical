<p>The TCF family of financial service providers - TCF BANK and its affiliated companies - understand that you expect your financial information to be kept private and secure.  We have taken the following steps to ensure your privacy is protected.  This policy applies only to products or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</p>
<p><b>What Information We Collect When You Visit Our Website</b></p>
<p><b>When you browse:</b> When you visit the TCF website and browse, we do not collect any information about you.  We do record the date and time of visits to our website and the pages visited while at our site.  We do this to determine which pages are visited most often, so we can enhance our website to make it more useful to our customers.</p>
<p><b>When you want information or perform online transactions:</b> When you visit the TCF website and request information or want banking transactions, we collect the information we believe is necessary to safely process the transaction.  For example, for online banking, you will be asked to enter your password and account number.  Our Internet Security policy more fully describes the information we collect to identify you for Internet banking transactions.  We need to identify you to prevent access to your information by unauthorized persons.</p>
<p>When you request information or want banking transactions, we may also collect information to help us understand your financial needs in order to offer you helpful products and services.  For example, if we know that you own a home, we may offer you a home equity loan.  We do this by collecting identifying information (such as your name and address), information from your application (such as your assets), transaction information with us (such as your loan repayment history) and information to comply with applicable laws and regulation.  For example, federal law requires us to collect a tax identification number, such as a social security number, for accounts which pay interest.  We may also collect information to design new products or services or modify existing products or services, in order to meet the needs of our customers.</p>
<p><b>How TCF Collects Customer Information</b></p>
<p>You will enter data that is collected by TCF.  In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information from consumer reporting agencies or your transaction history with us.  In addition, we record certain information about you based on what you do in our website.  For example, we will record the date and time you visited and the pages you visited.  We use this information to compile research to better serve our customers.</p>
<p><b>Use of "Cookie" Technologies</b></p>
<p>Some websites place permanent cookies, or permanent electronic files, on your hard drive; the cookies collect data.  We do not use permanent cookies or place any permanent electronic file on your computer.  This means you will have to re-enter your personal identification information each time you want to bank over the Internet with us.  However, we do use session cookies, which are automatically deleted at the end of a session.  Session cookies enable you to enter you password less frequently during a banking session with us.  If your browser lets you, you may decline our cookies, but if you do you may not be able to access all the features of our website including online banking and bill payment and you will have to enter you password more frequently during a session.</p>
<p><b>How We Use the Information We Collect</b></p>
<p>We collect identifying  information (such as your password) in online banking transactions to help us confirm you are the owner of the account.  If you do not provide the information we ask for, you will not be able to use our online banking services.</p>
<p>We may also use the information we collect about you to offer you products and services.  See "Sharing of Customer Information" below.</p>
<p><b>Accuracy of Customer Information</b></p>
<p>TCF has established audit procedures to maintain the accuracy and integrity of account and personal information.  If you believe the account or personal information we maintain is incorrect, or if you would like to review your account or personal information, please <a href="cu_home.htm" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>contact us</b></a>.</p>
<p><b>Contact for Privacy Concerns</b></p>
<p>If you believe TCF has not followed this Privacy Policy or if you have any questions or complaints regarding your privacy at TCF, <a href="cu_home.htm" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>contact us</b></a>.  You may also write to us at:<br>TCF Bank<br>Attn: Bank Central<br>801 Marquette Avenue<br>Minneapolis, MN 55402</p>
<p><b>When TCF will Contact You</b></p>
<p>If you request information and enter your request in this website, we will respond to you by the method we believe is most appropriate.  For example, if you e-mail us, we may respond by phone, mail, or e-mail.  In addition, we may contact you regarding products or services that we think you may be interested in or may be of benefit to you.  Otherwise, we will contact you if we have questions or concerns about your account(s) with us.</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>We use industry standards to safeguard your personal identifying information, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol and fire walls.  These systems are designed to guard against unauthorized access and use of customer information by unauthorized individuals.  We work to upgrade these features on an ongoing basis.  See <a href="ps_secre.htm" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Internet Security</b></a> for additional information regarding the steps we have taken to ensure your online banking transactions are secure.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;</li>
	<li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and</li>

<p><b>Benefits of sharing</b> By sharing information about you with TCF's affiliated companies, you may receive information about new products and services, special offers, or discounts.</p>
<p><b>Fair Credit Reporting Act Notice<br>Sharing Consumer Reports with TCF Affiliates</b><br>You may direct us not to share the information in the consumer reports with other TCF companies by <a href="cu_home.htm" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>contacting us</b></a>.</p>
<p>Please note that "consumer report information" does not include, and we will continue to share, identifying, transaction and experience, and application information even if you send us a notice.</p>
<p><b>What is a Consumer Report?</b><br>A consumer report is any written, oral, or other communication from a consumer reporting agency which bears on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for: (a)  credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; (b)  employment purposes; or (c)  any other purpose authorized under section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p>
<p><b>Sharing Customer Information with Other Companies</b><br>We may disclose the following kinds of nonpublic personal information about you to third parties who are not affiliated with TCF:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Information we receive from you on your application or other forms, such as your name, address, assets, and income;</li>
	<li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and account usage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Types of Companies We Share With</b><br>We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of third parties who are not affiliated with TCF:</p>

	<li>Others, such as government agencies and non-profit organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sharing Customer Information for Business, Service or Special Reasons</b><br>We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you  to third parties who are not affiliated with TCF, as permitted by law.  For example, we share information which is necessary to service your account, protect against fraud, or when we contract with third party agents or service providers to provide materials or services on our behalf.</p>
<p>We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described on the other side, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.</p>
<p><b>Sharing of Former Customer Information</b><br>We share information about former customers the same way we share information about current customers.  For example, we share information we receive from you on applications or other forms and we share information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others.  We may share this information with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers, securities broker-dealers, and insurance agents;</li>
	<li>Non-financial companies, such as retailers, direct marketers, airlines, and publishers;</li>

	<li>TCF companies.  Examples of TCF companies are a bank, a mortgage company, an annuity agency, an insurance agency, a brokerage company, and a mutual fund sales company.  We also share consumer report information with TCF companies (unless you tell us not to).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Employee Access to Customer Information</b><br>We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.  Our employees are trained to respect customer privacy and to access customer information only when they have a business reason to know the information.  Our employees are subject to discipline for violating our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b>Confidentiality and Security</b><br>TCF maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic information.</p>
<p><b>TCF is committed to honoring your privacy requests.</b> If you prefer that we not disclose non public personal information about you to third parties who are not affiliated with TCF, you may opt out of those disclosures.  That is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law).  If you wish to opt out of disclosures to third parties who are not affiliated with TCF, you may <a href="cu_home.htm" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>contact us</b></a>.
