      Effective 7/1/2004

      <blockquote> 
	  <p><i>We work hard to safeguard your information and 
		have no intention, now or in the future, of selling 
		your personal information to third-party businesses, 
		except as described below. You provide important information 
		about yourself to a variety of businesses and organizations. 
		As our customer you also provide us with important 
		information about yourself. This information helps 
		us give you better service, offer you better products, 
		and complete your transactions more effectively.</i> 
	  </p><p><i>We are proud to make that commitment to you because 
		your trust is the foundation of our business. In fact, 
		we developed the following privacy policy to explain 
		how we use and protect information about you. We ask 
		that you read it carefully.</i> 
	  </p><p><font color="#000080"><b>NOTICE 
		OF YOUR FINANCIAL PRIVACY RIGHTS </b></font> 
	  </p><p>We first define some terms. 
	  </p><p><b>We</b>, <b>our</b>, and <b>us</b>, when used in 
		this notice, mean Tri Counties Bank and all other 
		members of the TCB family of companies. 
	  </p><p>This is our privacy notice for our customers. When 
		we use the words "you" and "your" 
		we mean our consumer customers who have a continuing 
		relationship with us by purchasing or holding financial 
		products or services such as a 
	  </p><ul>
		<li>Deposit Account</li>
		<li>Loan account</li>
		<li>Safe Deposit box</li>
		<li>Retail installment contract we service</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>We will tell you the sources of the information we 
		collect about you. We will tell you what measures 
		we take to secure that information.
	  </p><p><i><b>Nonpublic personal information</b></i> means 
		information about you that we collect in connection 
		with providing a financial product or service to you. 
		Nonpublic personal information does not usually include 
		information that is available from public sources, 
		such as telephone directories or government records. 
		In this Notice, we will use the term "information" 
		to mean non-public personal information as defined 
		in this section.
	  </p><p>An <i><b>affiliate</b></i> is a member of our corporate 
		family. 
	  </p><p>A <i><b>nonaffiliated third party</b></i> is a person 
		we do not employ or a company that is not an affiliate 
		of ours. This is also known as nonaffiliated third 
		party, or simply, an "other party." Please 
		note that nonaffiliated third parties may have access 
		to information about you that has been obtained independently, 
		such as through credit bureaus or public records.
	  </p><p><b><font color="#000080">COLLECTING INFORMATION TO 
		CONDUCT YOUR BUSINESS</font></b>
	  </p><p>We collect information about you from the following 
		sources:
	  </p><ul>
		<li>Information you give us on applications or other 
		  forms</li>
		<li> Information about your transactions with us</li>
		<li> Information about your transactions with our 
		  affiliates</li>
		<li> Information about your transactions with other 
		  parties</li>
		<li> Information from a consumer reporting agency</li>
		<li> Information we receive through our Customer Identification Program</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> <b><font color="#000080">SECURITY PRACTICES TO PROTECT 
		YOUR INFORMATION</font></b> 
	  </p><p>We restrict access to information about you to those 
		employees who need to know that information in order 
		to provide products or services to you. Employees 
		who have access to your information are required to 
		protect and keep it confidential. Additionally, we 
		use technology designed to keep your information and 
		transactions private and secure, including when you 
		use our Internet Banking service for your on-line 
		banking and bill payment transactions. 
	  </p><p><b><font color="#000080">HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL 
		INFORMATION</font></b>
	  </p><p>We will not share information about you to anyone 
		outside of our corporate family except as disclosed 
		in this policy or as permitted by law. For example, 
		customer information on loan applications helps us 
		make loans that meet federal banking regulations. 
		Information on your signature card enables us to order 
		your checks from a check printer when you request 
		them. Your information can help protect your accounts 
		from fraud, help resolve customer disputes, or protect 
		property you have pledged as collateral for a loan.
	    </p><p>We may also share all of your information that we collect with companies that perform marketing 
          services on our behalf, and to certain of our own employees, who are also authorized representatives 
          of other financial service providers, such as Raymond James Financial Services with whom we 
          have carefully structured arrangements. These companies work jointly with us to provide a service 
          or product we are unable to provide for you solely within our own company. We are allowed to 
          do this only if they have entered into a joint marketing contract with us, which prohibits the 
          sharing of your information for their own unrelated marketing purposes. Examples of such products 
          and services include alternative investment products, such as mutual funds or annuities, or 
          life and casualty insurance products that protect life and property. In these instances, employees 
          have access to information such as your name, address, social security number, assets, income, 
          telephone number, and your transaction activity with us, such as account balances, payment and 
          deposit history. We will utilize only the information that we deem appropriate to offer you 
          these special products and services. 
        </p><p>Your Opt-Out rights appear in a separate document titled “Important Privacy Choices for 
          Consumers.” You may obtain this document by visiting any one of our branch locations, 
          by writing to us at Tri Counties Bank, P.O. Box 909, Attn: Direct Banking, Chico, California 
          95973, or by calling Customer Service at 800-922-8742. Note: If you exercise any Opt-out rights, 
          please allow two weeks for your opt-out request to be activated. 
        </p><p><b><font color="#000080">COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT 
		FORMER CUSTOMERS</font></b>
	  </p><p>We do not disclose information about former customers, 
		except as permitted or required by law.</p>
	  <p><b><font color="#000080">CHANGING OUR PRIVACY POLICY 
		IN THE FUTURE</font></b>
	  </p><p>We reserve the right to amend or change our policy 
		at any time, but if we do this, we will mail a new 
		policy to our current customers at least 30 days prior 
		to implementing the change, allowing you time to review 
		and act on the new changes.

	  you choose to provide such information.<br>
		<br>
	  If you visit our website to read or download information,

	  or access information about our Bank, unless you identify 
	  yourself so that we can respond to an inquiry or request 
	  from you, we collect and store only the following information: 
	</p><ul>

		purposes.&nbsp;</li>
		
	  <li>We maintain your personally identifying information

	  or losses caused by: 
	</p><ul>
		  <li> 
			
		<p>Customer input errors.

		<p>Customer's negligence by sharing or handling of

	  </p></li><li> 
			
		<p>Customer's neglect to report thefts of passwords

		<p>Customer's failure to complete banking sessions
