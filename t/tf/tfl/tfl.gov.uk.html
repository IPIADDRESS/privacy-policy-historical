<p>Click here to view our <a href="tandc.shtml">Terms and conditions</a> </p>
<p>This policy is designed to inform you of our commitment to upholding your right 
  to privacy when using any of our web services. It describes the ways in which 
  we capture information and the ways in which we use it.</p>
<p>For a statement of TfL’s wider obligations under Data Protection Act, 
  1998 please click here to view our <a href="tandc.shtml">Terms and Conditions</a>. 
</p>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) is a functional body of the Greater London Authority, 
  reporting to the Mayor of London.</p>
<p>TfL is responsible for managing, providing and procuring a range of transport 
  services and facilities on behalf of the Mayor. This is achieved through a number 
  of wholly owned subsidiary companies and modes which include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>London Buses </li>
  <li>Docklands Light Railway </li>
  <li>Dial-a-Ride </li>
  <li>London Trams </li>
  <li>Victoria Coach Station </li>
  <li>London River Services </li>
  <li>London’s Transport Museum </li>
  <li>London Underground </li>
  <li>Public Carriage Office </li>
  <li>CrossRail </li>
  <li>Street Management </li>
</ul>
<p>TfL considers its obligations under the Data Protection Act and related legislation 
  to be of paramount importance, and has taken steps to ensure compliance with 
  those provisions.<br>
  This privacy policy explains what information TfL and its subsidiaries collect 
  about those customers that use its websites and the procedures we have in place 
  to safeguard your privacy.</p>
<h2>What personal information do we collect?</h2>
<p>The information we request from you will depend on the type of service you 
  request or register for. It may simply be an e-mail address if you post a message 
  to our bulletin board or it may include details such as Vehicle Registration 
  Numbers if you are registering for Congestion Charging or credit card details 
  if you purchase a ticket on-line.</p>
<p>In any case, we will only request information that is necessary to enable us 
  to provide you with the service you have requested.</p>
<p>We may occasionally collect what is known as sensitive personal data under 
  the Data Protection Act. This may happen where you are a Blue Badge holder and 
  apply for a congestion charging discount or are claiming a fare refund owing 
  to ill health. When we collect this type of data we are required to go to greater 
  lengths to look after it and keep its use to a minimum. We will always aim to 
  get your agreement to our using your sensitive personal data for those limited 
  purposes.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, please get your parent/guardian's permission before providing 
  personal information to TfL. </p>
<h2>Why do we collect and store your information?</h2>
<p>TfL operates in a wide variety of business areas and therefore uses personal 
  data in many different ways. These purposes are notified to the Information 
  Commissioner who regulates the Data Protection Act and you can see the current 
  notification for TfL and its subsidiaries at www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk 
</p>
<p>The principle purposes for which we collect and store your information are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Travel ticket administration (including fare enforcement and prosecutions) 
  </li>
  <li>Congestion charging </li>
  <li>Bus lane enforcement </li>
  <li>Research </li>
  <li>Marketing </li>
  <li>Travel alerts </li>
  <li>Taxi and private hire vehicle licensing </li>
  <li>Provision of customised web enabled services </li>
  <li>Journey planning </li>
  <li>General information relating to TfL’s activities </li>
</ul>
<h2>How do we contact you?</h2>
<p>We may contact you to provide the services that you have purchased or registered 
  for. Depending on your preferences we may contact you by post, email, telephone 
  or text messaging.</p>
<h2>What do we do with your information?</h2>
<h3>Direct Marketing</h3>
<p>When we collect information from you we will tell you if we would like to send 
  you information about our products and services or transport related issues. 
  We will give you the opportunity to tell us you do not wish to receive such 
  information. If you do not object to receiving marketing material at the time, 
  but subsequently change your mind, you may tell us so at any time by contacting 
  us using the details given below.</p>
<p>For information please contact <a href="mailto:enquire@tfl.gov.uk">enquire@tfl.gov.uk 
  </a></p>
<p>If we wish to share your data with third parties for marketing purposes, we 
  will again tell you about this and only do so if we get your consent. Again, 
  you may tell us at any time that you no longer agree to your details being shared 
  with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Occasionally, we or one of our agents may contact you for research purposes. 
  We only hire reputable third parties do undertake such projects on our behalf. 
  You are under no obligation to participate in this research.</p>
<h3>Transferring your information overseas </h3>
<p>TfL will not transfer your information outside the European Economic Area. 
</p>
<h3>Disclosing information</h3>
<p>We may disclose your personal data to our service providers who are responsible 
  for operating some of our services.</p>
<p>These may include train operating companies for the DLR, bus operating companies 
  and processors involved in congestion charging and providing ticketing and information 
  services. Where such disclosures are made, this will be under contractual arrangements 
  with TfL and carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection 
  Act, 1998.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal data to the London Boroughs and other agencies 
  such as appeals and adjudication services, and the Passenger Consultative Committee; 
  we would only do this with your consent.</p>
<p>TfL may disclose personal data to the DVLA, police and other law enforcement 
  agencies at their request, for the purposes of crime prevention and detection 
  and where otherwise required to do so by law. </p>

  A cookie will typically contain the name of the website from which the cookie 
  has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly
