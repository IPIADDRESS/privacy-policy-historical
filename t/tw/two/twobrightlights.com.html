					<h5>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</h5>
					<p>Two Bright Lights uses “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive.

The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, session identification number and your navigational history and preferences.</p>
					<p>Cookies offer you many conveniences. They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results, access lightboxes and view their previous invoices.

					<p>In some cases, our third-party service providers may use cookies on our sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Two Bright Lights only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
					<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.

					<ul>
						<li>Limiting access to your personal information to those of our employees who require it to provide services to you;</li>
						<li>Requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements to protect customer and other confidential information;</li>
						<li>Ensuring that third-party service providers sign confidentiality agreements to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and not to use it for any unauthorized purposes;</li>
						<li>Encrypting credit card information on our order forms using secure socket layer (SSL) technology; and</li>
						<li>Storing your personal information in secure computer systems which protect it from unauthorized access or use.</li>
				  </ul>
					<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
					<p>If a password is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.</p>
					<h5>Email Referrals</h5>
					<p>If you choose to use our email referral services to tell a friend about our products or services we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will use that information to send your friend a email inviting him or her to visit the site and review the product or service you have selected. We may use a third-party provider to administer this function, but any such third-party provider may only use the information submitted to facilitate this email.</p>

If you are under 18, you shall not use or enter information on this site, including without limitation, any Interactive Areas of the site without parental consent.
