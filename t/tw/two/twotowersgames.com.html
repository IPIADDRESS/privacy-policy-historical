	<div class="descr">Once upon a time there lived an unrivaled warrior, a famous consummate military master. One day he decided to go to <strong>Two Towers</strong> where the sage old man lived, the wisest person in the world. When the warrior found the wise man he saw him playing and having fun as would a young boy. The warrior asks of him, "Why do you waste your valuable time in such a manner elder?" The wise man replied to him, "The one who makes time only for work, and naught for rest and pleasure, will soon find he has no passion left for his work. No matter how we live, or what we do, we must find the time for our rest and fun". The warrior thinks a moment before replying, "Well, I think the time for <strong>Free Online Flash Games</strong> has come!"</div>
