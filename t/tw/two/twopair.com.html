</ul>
<p>At America's Best, we respect our customers and understand that they are concerned about privacy, so we have instituted policies intended to ensure that your personal information is handled safely and responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains what America's Best does with your information and what you can expect from America's Best.  You should review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. This policy was last revised on December 28, 2000.</p>
<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
<h4>Browsing</h4>
<p>When you browse twopair.com, you do so anonymously. America's Best does not collect personally identifying information about you. We do collect non-personally identifying data, such as your IP address and specific Web pages through which you click. This data is utilized in the aggregate to help us look for trends so that we can improve our Web site and your user experience.</p>
<h4>Making An Appointment Online</h4>
<p>When you schedule an eye examination online, we ask for your name, home telephone number and work telephone number in order to schedule the appointment with the store you choose to visit and contact you if we need to.</p>
<h4>Participating In Our Survey / Contacting Us</h4>
<p>If you choose to participate in our survey, you have the option of providing us with personally identifying information such as your name, telephone number, work telephone number and email address so that we can respond to any complaints and improve your shopping experience. You also may choose to contact us regarding career opportunities, customer service issues or questions about this site.</p>
<h4>What Does America's Best Do With The Information It Gathers?</h4>
<p>When you schedule an appointment, we use the information you have provided to schedule your examination. The information you supply to us also is added to our customer database. You may receive periodic mailings, emails or telephone calls from us about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events.</p>
<p>The only America's Best employees with access to your information are those employees who need the information to do their jobs. All employees are educated about America's Best policies and practices in regard to safeguarding customer information, preventing its unauthorized access, use or disclosure and ensuring its proper handling.</p>
<p>America's Best does not rent, sell or exchange personally identifiable information about its customers. The Company may provide information to regulatory authorities, law enforcement officials or other government agencies when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
<p>Third parties that need access to your information to provide operational or other support services to us agree to safeguard your information in compliance with this Privacy Policy. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of outside companies.</p>
<h4>How Can I Update My Personal Information?</h4>
<p>Whenever you log on to our bestcontacts.com site, you are given the opportunity to edit your personal information.</p>
<h4>What Are "Cookies" and Do We Use Them?</h4>
<p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by us that is saved on the hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information we may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. Most Web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookie files on your computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file is stored. You should take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function. If you elect to disable an America's Best cookie, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Web site.</p>
<h4>How Is Data Secured?</h4>
<p>America's Best is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of all information collected on our site. When credit card information is transmitted online, America's Best uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server software to prevent unauthorized access to the information. SSL is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our Web site's servers. You can identify the secure connection by looking for a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window.</p>
<h4>Children's Policy</h4>
<p>America's Best does not seek information from anyone under the age of thirteen. If a person under age thirteen submits information to us through any part of our Web site, and we know that the person submitting information is under age thirteen, we will not use it for any purpose. We will delete the information as soon as we discover it and we will not disclose it to third parties.</p>
<p>Your confidence in America's Best is our highest priority.</p>
