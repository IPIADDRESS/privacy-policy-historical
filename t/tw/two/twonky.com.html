			<h2>Privacy</h2>
			<p>This Privacy Policy outlines PacketVideo’s information gathering and usage practices for end users ("Users") of its "Twonky" software product (hereinafter referred to as the "Software")). Its purpose is to notify you of what personally identifiable information of yours ("User Information") is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. Any updates to this Privacy Policy will be announced on the www.pv.com web site. </p>

			<p>For Users accessing the Facebook application using the Software, PacketVideo will store two pieces of User Information: the User’s Facebook User ID, and the offline access permission the User provides to authorize PacketVideo to retrieve photo, album, and friend information, to allow access when requested by the User using his/her Software account. The User may opt out of this arrangement at any time by following the simple opt-out procedures set forth herein.</p>

			<p>PacketVideo does not rent, sell or lease user information collected through the Software. If this policy is changed in the future, and we decide to share this data with other third parties, you will be given the opportunity to opt out prior to any information being exchanged. Local country laws are applied where they differ from this policy.</p>
			
			<p>We are firmly committed to guarding the confidence you have placed in our company and to use, responsibly and professionally, any information you volunteer. We strive to collect only that information that we think is necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to better understand you (our customer), to provide better service, to improve marketing of our products, to educate customers and to ensure that our proprietary information is protected. We are committed to using the information collected only for these purposes and those outlined herein. Links to third party web sites, from the Software are provided solely as a convenience for you. We have not reviewed, nor do we monitor, these third party sites and we do not control, nor are we responsible for, any of these sites, their content or their privacy policy (if any). This policy discloses our information gathering and usage practices for the Software as outlined below: </p>

			<h3>Product Registration &amp; Online Support</h3>
			<p>In order to improve our problem resolution process through better product and case tracking, PacketVideo's tech support department has implemented online product registration and technical support service. We require contact information and product serial number, license authorization code or other product-identifying information to identify your product. This information is used to manage your case, notify you when necessary of issues related to your product and, together with your voluntary responses to our marketing survey, it is used to analyze our customer base in aggregate. If you request, we may send you emails to give you information we think you will find useful, such as information about new features, products or promotions. When we email you, we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe so you will not receive our emails in the future.</p>

			<p>PacketVideo may occasionally sponsor sweepstakes, contests and promotions. If you request, we may use contact data from our promotions to send you information we think you will find useful, such as information about new products or promotions. When we email you, we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe, so you will not receive our emails in the future.</p>

			<h3>Online Surveys</h3>
			<p>Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like email address). This may be used to contact you if additional follow-up is appropriate, but will not be used for future marketing purposes, unless you so request and such use is explicitly stated.</p>

			<h3>Email Newsletters</h3>
			<p>PacketVideo may distribute various product-or topic-specific newsletters, which you may receive at your request. We require first name and last name, so that we may personalize your greeting, email address and in some cases your country, as not all offers are valid in all countries. Typically all other contact information is voluntary and, if you request, may be used to send other information or offers via mail. We do not share your information with third parties, except as required to deliver our message. Whenever we send a newsletter we will provide a method to subscribe and/or unsubscribe.</p>
			
			<h3>Discussion List</h3>
			<p>PacketVideo may host discussion lists or other moderated forums for users of PacketVideo software where users can help each other with technical and general questions. Topics for discussion include technical support questions and problems, sales information, suggestions for improvement, or anything else that relates to PacketVideo products or services. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in this area becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>
			
			<h3>Opt-In/Unsubscribing</h3>
			<p>PacketVideo will not send you any marketing communications unless you request PacketVideo to do so. We provide users the opportunity to opt-in to receiveing communications from us and/or our partners at the point where we request your information. Additionally, you may use one of the following options to request removal of your information from our databases.
