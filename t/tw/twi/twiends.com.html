<h5>5. Cookies</h5>
<p>We may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. 
Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service.

        We're a twitter community that allows you to get twitter followers. Using seeds you can get free followers on twitter simply by listing yourself here.
        You should not buy twitter followers, as this is not permitted, but rather promote your twitter account safely and ethically using our directory.
        Buying followers is a bad idea, as it will only expose you to a large number of fake accounts.
