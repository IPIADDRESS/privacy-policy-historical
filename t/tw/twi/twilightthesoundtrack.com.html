<p><strong><a name="1personal" id="1personal"></a>1.	Personal Data We Collect</strong><br>

<strong>(a)	Active Collection of Personal Data.</strong> <strong>“Personal Data”</strong> is information that would allow someone to identify you personally.   The types of Personal Data we collect from you via the Site will vary depending on the activity involved, but may include: first and last name, address, e-mail address, mobile phone number and phone number.   We do not require that you provide Personal Data to obtain access to public parts of the Site, however, some areas of the Site may ask you to submit Personal Data in order for you to benefit from the specified features or to participate in a particular activity.  For example, we may collect Personal Data when you register on the Site; participate in games, contests, sweepstakes, events, or other promotional events (collectively, "<strong><em>Promotions</em></strong>") offered through the Site; subscribe to an online newsletter and other communications (e.g., whether by e-mail, mobile device, etc.); send questions or comments to us, or fill out online surveys or participate on message boards.   Providing us with Personal Data about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain of the Site's features.</p>

<p>In addition, you may have the opportunity to provide us with the Personal Data, such as name, e-mail address and/or mobile phone number, of a friend, such as if you chose to send a friend an electronic greeting card, trailer or other special feature from our Site. The e-mail addresses or phone numbers you supply us for those activities will not be retained for other purposes unless we disclose otherwise at the time you provide such information. We encourage you to send such items only to recipients who are your friends or family or persons with whom you have a relationship.</p>

<p><strong>(b)	Active Collection From Third Parties.</strong>  

From time to time we may obtain Personal Data that has been collected by third parties For example, our co-promoters or sponsors may provide us with information, including Personal Data, about users that choose to participate in a promotional opportunity the co-promoter or sponsor is offering in connection with us.  We may use such personal information in combination with Personal Data that we have collected from you on the Site, in which case we will apply this Privacy Policy to such. However, because this Personal Data is not collected on the Site, we are not responsible for the accuracy of this data or how such third parties collect and use such data. </p>

<p><strong><a name="2data" id="2data"></a>2. Passive Collective of Non Personal Data.</strong>  As you navigate through or interact with the Site, certain other information, such as log files, server logs and clickstream data (collectively, "<strong><em>Non Personal Data</em></strong>") can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags,  web beacons, mobile devices or other technologies.  We may use such Non Personal Data for many purposes including to provide better service to Site visitors, customize the Site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends and otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use.   Where we associate Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, we will treat all of that information as Personal Data.  We may collect Non-Personal Data using various technologies described as follows:</p>

<p><strong>(i)	Cookies.</strong>   Cookies are pieces of information that a website either transfers to your computer's hard drive (or other Internet-accessing device) or stores temporarily in your computer's memory for record-keeping purposes.  We may use cookies for a number of purposes such as when we conduct sweepstakes to limit multiple registrations or to track usage patterns on the Site. While most browsers are set up to accept cookies, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, if you decline to accept this Site's cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of this Site.  We do not save Personal Data in cookies but we may link cookies to any Personal Data or other information we collect.   </p>

<p><strong>(ii)	IP Addresses. </strong>  An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer or network whenever you are on the Internet.  When you request to view pages from this Site, our servers log your IP address.  We may use IP address for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the use of the Site. We may associate your IP address with the Personal Data you provide.
</p>
<p><strong>(iii)	Web Beacons.</strong>   The Site's pages and any communications sent by the Site may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "clear gif.  Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or Site communication, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon.  We may use web beacons to count visitors to our Site or to monitor how visitors navigate our Site, and we may include web beacons in communications sent from the Site in order to count how many messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon.  
</p>
<p><strong>(iv)	Mobile Devices. </strong>  Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we will receive such information if you access the Site through mobile devices.  Certain features of the Site may require collection of a mobile phone number and we may associate that phone number and other Personal Data to the mobile device identification information.  Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate a system that pinpoints the physical location of devices that use their service.  Depending on the provider, we may automatically receive this information.

These Advertisers may use this information to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  This Privacy Policy does not cover these methods for collecting information by these Advertisers or the use of the information collected by the Advertisers.
