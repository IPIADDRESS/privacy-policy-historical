<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>It is important to us to have your trust also when it comes to your personal data. 
We want you to know our policy when handling your data. 
You can rest assured that we will also comply with data protection laws.</p>

<h3>At Twinity, you decide!</h3>
<p>At Twinity, our no. 1 rule is: If you do not disclose information yourselves 
to the public or selected members of the Twinity community, we will not disclose 
or sell personal data. There is just one exception: when we are required to do so by law, 
especially upon court or administrative order.</p>

<h3>How do we raise, process and store personal data?</h3>
<p>We get personal data only if you give it directly to us, with very few exceptions for usage 
data which are explained in detail below. Some kind of data we do require you to submit, 
in other cases you have decided to disclose them.</p>

<h3>Required information</h3>
<p>In order to use Twinity, you are required to submit a few personal information 
(hereinafter: "required information"). The following required information will automatically be 
disclosed to all users:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gender</li>
	<li>Display name (which can be your first name and family name or a chosen user name)</li>
</ul>

<p>By default we will display your first name and family name but you have the possibility to switch 
to the display of your user name.</p>

<h3>Optional information</h3>
<p>Apart from the information filled in when registering, you are free to submit further information 
(hereinafter "optional information") which helps other Twinity members to learn more about you and know 
whether you are a matching contact. Once you submit optional information, 
it will be accessible for all other Twinity users, unless otherwise specified. 
If you do no longer want other users to see optional information, you can delete such information at any time.</p>

<h3>Your friends, places, events and items</h3>
<p>Per default, Twinity allows other users to see all optional information as well as all 
lists with your friends, places, events, and items.</p>

<h3>A word of warning...</h3>
<p>Never forget that information you disclose to everyone or selected members 
of the Twinity community are public. Even if you disclose certain information only to selected persons, 
you can never be sure how they will handle it. The only thing we can promise is that we do not use the data 
for any other purposes. Please think twice about possible consequences before disclosing data to everyone.</p>

<h3>Personal statistics</h3>
<p>In your profile, the personal statistics about you are always visible for all Twinity users. 
This includes especially the following statistics:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The date of your registration</li>
	<li>The number of friends</li>
	<li>The number of places, events and items</li> 
	<li>Type of membership</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is usage data?</h3>
<p>Whenever you use Twinity, we store the domain name and/or IP address of the computer which contacts 
us as well as the data request of the client (file name and URL), the http response code, 
the website which referred you to us, the date and the duration of your visit and the requested pages 
of our website.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of your actions (like performing an animation, uploading an object, etc.) will 
be logged while making use of the client. These actions will be logged in a completely anonymous way 
and cannot be tracked back to the user who performed one of these actions.</p>
<p>Such storage serves the purpose of tracking malfunctions and abuse of Twinity and our services, 
may be required for building up subsequent connections and for payment. We also use it to improve our services.</p>

<h3>What happens to personal information?</h3>
<p>As far as we use personal data to build user profiles, we will not disclose these profiles 
to anyone without your consent. We may put third parties in a position to communicate with you for advertising
purposes. Your profile might be used to select advertising information which suits your interests. 
Any third party has to communicate with you through us, however, which means that we do not disclose your usage data.
</p>
<p>When we analyze statistical data, we will disclose such analysis to third party in anonymous form only. 
As far as we work together with third parties in order to deliver our services to you (hosting or call centers 
might be such cases), we will oblige them to respect the relevant data protection rules in case they receive 
personal data, and ensure sufficient data protection.
</p>

<h3>What is a Cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small file which is being sent from web-servers to the user's computer when visiting a website. 
It is stored on the computer's hard disk. If the same web-server is visited again, the web-browser sends 
the cookie back to the server. The server can then process such information. 
Cookies can be used to facilitate navigation on a website (which might "remember" information previously submitted) 
or to manage advertising banners (so you do not see the same banner over and over again). 
Cookies have a given expiry date and automatically end afterwards. You can manually delete Cookies 
from your hard disk. Your browser also allows deactivating Cookies completely.</p>

<p>At Twinity, we do not use Cookies for personal data but only to see when you have previously visited us.</p>

<h3>What are IP addresses?</h3>
<p>IP addresses allow for the identification of devices connected to the internet. 
Each computer connected to the internet has its IP address, i.e. a combination of numbers. 
Your internet provider can identify you by your IP address.</p>

<h3>What should I know about changing or deleting my personal data?</h3>
<p>Our aim is to store correct personal data. You can modify your data (i.e. update, rectify or amend), 
or delete it. To protect your privacy and for your own security, we check your identity before you can do so.
</p>
<p>If you want us to change your data, please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:support@twinity.com">support@twinity.com</a>. 
You can also contact us via 
this mail address if you want us to no longer use your data. In this case, we will 
delete all your data as soon as possible. Please note that, due to technical or organizational reasons, 
even after sending your mail, some measures already commenced may still be accomplished.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy from time to time at our own discretion, 
but always respecting the then-current laws on data protection. We will inform you in 
case the scope in which we use your personal data is enlarged.</p>
