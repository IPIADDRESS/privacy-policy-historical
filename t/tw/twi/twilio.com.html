<p class="weather_normtxt">
Your privacy is important, so Twilio has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our website, why we collect it and how it is used. 
</p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the customer using our website.  The terms "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Twilio. This Privacy Policy is governed by our <a href="/legal/tos">Terms of Service</a>. By using this website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.
</p>


<p class="weather_normtxt">
</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">What Information Is Collected?</h4>
"Personally identifiable information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. When you use our website Twilio may collect from you the following personally identifiable information:  first and last name, city, state and zip code, email address, birthday and phone number.  Twilio also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page you request. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
<p></p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
Twilio may keep a cached copy of the content you serve us as a part of your use of the service for an indeterminate amount of time, including media files and XML files.  To assist in development, we may keep copies of HTTP requests and responses in your notification log, available only to you.  If your web server does not specify that we can cache your content, we will not keep a cached copy of any text or audio data transmitted through our service during calls, but we may still maintain copies in your notification log.  If data privacy is a concern, make sure your server does not allow us to cache such content, and contact us so that we may turn off other application logging around requests to and responses from your application.  We may keep call log, notification log, billing/payment, and other log data for at least six months from the date of entry.  
</p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">How Is Such Information Used?</h4>
Your personally identifiable information may be used to provide you with new product information and support services offered on the website, to notify you of technical updates or changes in policy, or to deliver other services. 
<p></p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?</h4>
Information collected from you is only used to complete and support your use of our website and services and to comply with any requirements of law.  Therefore, in some cases, in order to provide you with our services, we may be required to supply your personally identifiable information to our service providers.  Otherwise, Twilio does not rent, sell or share personally identifiable information it collects about you or phone numbers it observes in conjunction with use of your account to or with third parties. Twilio may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary. 
<p></p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Access</h4>
In the event that you have volunteered personally identifiable information, you may correct or amend that information by editing your account <a href="/user/account">profile</a> or email us at privacy@twilio.com
<p></p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">The Security of Your Information</h4>
We will take reasonable precautions to protect personally identifiable information in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is, however, 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<p></p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Children</h4>
Twilio is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 13.  Any person who provides their information to Twilio represents to us that they are 13 years of age or older.
<p></p>

<p class="weather_normtxt">
</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Cookies</h4>
Cookies are small text files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our website.  Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information.  Most browsers will accept cookies until you change your browser settings to refuse them.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Twilio and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party.
<p></p>

</p><h4 style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Forums and Comments</h4>
If you use the forum or post comments on this website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personally identifiable information we collect. Your continued use of this website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.
