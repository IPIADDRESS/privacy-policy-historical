<p><strong>EVRI.COM PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Evri, Inc. (together with its corporate affiliates,  collectively, <strong>“Evri”</strong>, <strong>“we”</strong>, or <strong>“us”</strong>)  respects our users’ privacy rights. This policy explains how we may use  personal information that you provide to us through and in connection  with our websites (including the websites located at http://www.evri.com  and http://www.thesummarizer.com) and related services (collectively,  the <strong>“Service”</strong>).  We may amend this privacy policy from  time to time, including as to specific web sites.  If we do so, we will  post a revised privacy policy on the Service (or, if only certain  site(s) included in the Service are affected, on the affected site(s)),  together with a notice of the date it was amended.</p>
<p><strong>Part I. Information Collection</strong></p>
<p>You may choose to provide us with information about  yourself (including your name, email address, physical address,  telephone number, password and other information) that can be used to  personally identify you. In addition, our Service may automatically  collect certain types of information about you when you use it (such as  IP addresses, browser type, browsing history and web site usage  information, and information about advertisements and other links that  you click on or view).</p>
<p>Any types of information we collect about you that can be  used to personally identify you are referred to in this policy  collectively as <strong>“Personally Identifiable Information.”</strong> We will never disclose any Personally Identifiable Information related  to you to any third party except in the limited circumstances described  in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information  from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to  register.  If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register an  account on the Service or send any information about yourself to us,  including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  No  one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the  Service.  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal  information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental  consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you  believe that we might have any information from or about a child under   13, please contact us at info@evri.com.</p>
<p>We also employ cookies.  A cookie is a small text file that  our Web server places on a user’s computer hard drive to help us  uniquely identify your computer.  Cookies enable Evri to track web site  usage patterns and deliver customized content to you. If you wish, you  can disable cookies by using the tools provided in your internet  browser; however, if you do so, some features of the Service may become  unavailable or be limited in their functionality.</p>
<p>Advertisers on the Service and other third parties may also  place cookies on your computer, and the Service also contains links to  third party web sites. Evri, of course, is not responsible for the  privacy policies or practices of any third parties (including  advertisers on the Service or operators of sites linked to from the  Service), or for enforcing compliance with them. We encourage our users  to read the privacy statements of any other web site that collects  personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely  to information collected by Evri.</p>
<p>We may also collect information in the course of your  interaction with the Service that cannot be used to personally identify  you (such as aggregate data regarding web site usage that cannot be  specifically tied to any individual, the type of computer and/or  operating system you are using, the type of browser you are using and  times and dates of usage). This type of information is referred to below  as <strong>“Non-Personally Identifying Information.”</strong></p>
<p>By using the Service, you are consenting to have your  personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Part II. Information Usage</strong></p>
<p>We may reproduce, display, transmit, analyze, disclose and  otherwise use (and permit third parties to use) Non-Personally  Identifiable Information for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial.  We may use Personally Identifiable Information: (a) in connection with  the operation of the Service; (b) to send you legally required  notifications, notifications relating to the operation of the Service,  and notifications about features of the Service that you may find  interesting, in each case in accordance with your communications  preferences set through the Service; and (c) for our internal business  purposes.</p>
<p>We will only disclose Personally Identifiable Information  about you to third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(A) If you register an account with us and elect to provide  us with Personally Identifiable Information to be publicly associated  with your account, we may display that information through the Service  in association with your account. Information publicly displayed in your  account profile may also be made available to third party search  engines.</p>
<p>(B) We may provide information to service providers to help  us bring you the Service.  Specifically, we may use third parties to  facilitate our business, such as to host the Service at a co-location  facility for servers, to send out email updates about the Service, to  remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments  for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or  to provide search results, advertisements or links (including sponsored  links).  In connection with these offerings and business operations,  our service providers may have access to your personal information for  use for a limited time in connection with these business activities.   Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal  information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical  protections limiting the use of that information to the Evri-specified  purposes.</p>
<p>(C) Certain services and features available through the  Service may enable you to post, upload or otherwise make content  available, in which you may elect to include Personally Identifiable  Information. Please be advised that information posted or otherwise made  available through these services or features becomes public knowledge.</p>
<p>(D)  We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information  when, in our determination, it is legally required under the laws or  regulations of any jurisdiction (for example, in response to subpoenas,  court orders or other legal process), and when, in our determination, it  is necessary to do so to establish or exercise our legal rights or  defend against legal or equitable claims;</p>
<p>(E)  We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if  we deem it necessary or advisable in order to protect the safety or  property of Evri, our users or third parties.</p>
<p>(F)  We may let you choose to share Personally Identifiable  Information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through  on-site offers.</p>
<p>(G)  Certain features or services available through the  Service may be provided jointly with other companies. You can tell when  another company is involved in any feature or service provided on the  Service, and we may share Personally Identifiable Information with that  company in connection with your use of that feature or service.</p>
<p>(H)  If the ownership of all or substantially all of the  Evri business, or individual business units owned by Evri, were to  change, your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred to  the new owner so the Service can continue operations. In any such  transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to  the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Part III. Access to Information</strong></p>
<p>If you have created a user profile on the Service, you may  modify or delete your profile information by logging into your account.  Changes or deletions to profile information will be reflected on the  Service immediately. Deleted information may persist in our archives for  a reasonable period of time, but will not be generally available to  other users. You can also correct or request deletion of any Personally  Identifiable Information we store about you by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@evri.com">info@evri.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Part IV. Data Storage and Security</strong></p>
<p>Evri uses commercially reasonable technical measures  designed to protect our users’ information, including by requesting a  unique password to verify your identity before granting you access to  any personal account you may have registered with us. However, we cannot  guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat  any security measures we employ, and you acknowledge that you provide  your personal information at your own risk. If your Personally  Identifiable Information is obtained by a third party as the result of a  security breach, and you have provided us with valid contact  information, we will notify you promptly after becoming aware of it. You  are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and other  credentials used on the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Part V. Policy Changes</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any  time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect  immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of  their posting on this site.  If we make changes, we will post them and  will indicate at the top of this page the policy’s new effective date.   If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by  email, and/or through notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer  to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current  privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy  applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
<p><strong>Part VI. Problem Resolution</strong></p>
<p>If problems arise, or if you have questions about this  policy, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@evri.com">info@evri.com</a>.  You may also contact us by mail at 206 1<sup>st</sup> Avenue S., Ste. 310, Seattle,  WA 98104.</p>
