<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0084B4">Twitgoo Privacy Policy </span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0084B4;font-weight:bold;">Effective as of March 1, 2009</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Photobucket, Inc. ("Twitgoo"
or "we") operates Twitgoo.com (the "Site"), which allows users to upload images,
and videos and associate them with a unique URL to create online access to the
images and videos for themselves and others, both on the Site and on other
websites where the user posts the URL ("quick link feature"). This Privacy
Policy describes Twitgoo's use and sharing of personally identifiable
information ("PII"-- your full name or email address,) that Members voluntarily
provide to Twitgoo when they register or update the Settings part of their
Profile (also known as "Registration PII"). The Term "User" refers to a
Visitor or a Member. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by Twitgoo, which
may include the Site, image and video sharing (including the quick link
feature), other features (for example, image editor), and any other features,
content, mobile services, Twitgoo branded URLs or applications offered from
time to time by Twitgoo in connection with Twitgoo's business (collectively,
the "Twitgoo Services"). </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Site is a general
audience site and Twitgoo does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13
years of age.<b> </b></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>From time to time Twitgoo may
modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the
law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Twitgoo
Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting
by Twitgoo on the Site. Your continued use of the Twitgoo Services after Twitgoo
posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy
Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy
regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If Twitgoo materially
changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will
continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you
have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.<b> </b></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>COLLECTION OF PII BY <span style="text-transform:uppercase">Twitgoo </span></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><u><span>General</span></u><span>. When Twitgoo collects PII from you it is because you
are voluntarily submitting PII to us in order to register as a Member of Twitgoo.
Twitgoo may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in Twitgoo
Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, games and surveys, or because
you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or
information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to Twitgoo
for review. Other PII including first and last name and mobile telephone
numbers may also be collected. We may also obtain PII from reputable third
parties.</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In addition, Twitgoo collects
other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This
data is used to manage and improve the Twitgoo Services, track usage, and for
security purposes. </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twitgoo Members may also
choose to provide or store non-PII information in their profiles, including but
not limited to groups with whom they are affiliated, videos and/or pictures,
(collectively "Profile Information"). The Profile Information in a Member's
profile is provided at his or her sole discretion.</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twitgoo Members can change
their Registration PII and Profile Information at any time by controlling their
account settings, available within the settings portion of their Twitgoo
profile. <br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Cookies</span></u><span>. Cookies are small bits of information that Twitgoo
places on your computer. Twitgoo uses cookies to identify your Internet
browser, store Users' preferences, and to determine whether you have installed
the enabling software needed to access certain material on the Twitgoo
Services. Data in cookies may be read to authenticate user sessions or provide
services.<br>
<br>
Third-party advertisements displayed on Twitgoo Services may also contain
cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. Twitgoo does not
control these cookies and Users of the Twitgoo Services should check the
privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether
and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section below for more information
on third-party advertising.</span><span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"> </span></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>You can program your computer
to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or
block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to
certain features on the Twitgoo Services.</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>NOTICE: Twitgoo WILL PROVIDE
YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When you voluntarily provide
PII to Twitgoo, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the
information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of
uses Twitgoo will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a
manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy. </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>At the time you provide your
PII, Twitgoo will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See
"Choice" below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Twitgoo will not
share your PII with third parties unless you have given Twitgoo permission to
do so (See "Use" below).<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twitgoo Services may be
linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Twitgoo Services may
also carry advertisements from other companies. Twitgoo is not responsible for
the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to
or integrated with the Twitgoo Services or for the privacy practices of third-party
Internet advertising companies. Once you leave Twitgoo Services via such a
link, or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable
privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will
handle any PII they collect from you.</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twitgoo Services may also be
linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Twitgoo (i.e., that are
part of the News America Group: "Affiliated Companies"). Although all Affiliated
Companies adhere to the <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">News America 
corporate Privacy Principles</a>, Users who visit those Affiliated Company
sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices,
which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1"><span>Twitgoo may use cookies and similar tools to customize
the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile Information you
have provided. Profile Information you provide in structured profile fields or
questions (multiple choice questions like "Language") and other non-PII about
you may also be used to customize the online ads you encounter to those we
believe are aligned with your interests. The information used for this feature
does not provide your PII or identify you as an individual to third parties. <b><br>
<br>
</b></span></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some of the advertisements
that appear on the Site are delivered to you by third party Internet
advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver
advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PII about your visit
to or use of Twitgoo Services, including information about the ads they
display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. To
opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information
about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt-out.asp">http:www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt-out.asp</a></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Third party applications
(such as widgets) created by third party developers may also be available on or
in connection with the Twitgoo Services. Third party applications are small
bits of software, often with interactivity, that users may be able to install
into profiles, use to access the Twitgoo Services, or share with other Users.
However, Twitgoo does not control the third party developers, and cannot
dictate their actions. When a Member engages with a third party application,
that Member is interacting with the third party developer, not with Twitgoo.
Twitgoo encourages Members not to provide PII to the third party's application
unless the Member knows the party with whom it is interacting. </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>CHOICE: Twitgoo WILL PROVIDE
YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Except as described in this
Privacy Policy, Twitgoo will get your permission before we use the PII you
provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was
submitted or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Twitgoo.</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>USE: <span style="text-transform:
uppercase">Twitgoo's</span> USE OF PII</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twitgoo will only use the PII
you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If Twitgoo
obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that
information is also governed by this Privacy Policy. </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In order to locate other Twitgoo
Members that you may already know in the physical world, Twitgoo allows Users
to search for Members using Members' email addresses). If you have consented
to receive promotional materials from Twitgoo, Twitgoo may periodically use
your email address to send you such notifications related to the Twitgoo
Services. If you want to stop receiving such promotional materials from Twitgoo,
click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each promotional email. </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twitgoo employees, agents and
contractors must have a business reason to obtain access to your PII. Twitgoo
may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information
activities (i.e., message boards, sweepstakes administration, order
fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside
contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging
and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> </span></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>These outside contractors,
agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but
they may only use your PII to provide Twitgoo with a specific service and not
for any other purpose without your consent. Twitgoo may also provide your PII
to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain
information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request
requires the sharing of your PII. Twitgoo also may share your PII with Affiliated
Companies if it has a business reason to do so. <b><br>
<br>
</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>As described in "Notice"
above, Twitgoo may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive
on the Site, or may work with outside companies to do so. Your non-PII may be
shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Twitgoo
prohibits these companies from sharing your information with any third party or
from using it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream, number of page
views calculated by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic information may also
be shared with Twitgoo's advertisers and business partners.<b> </b></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>There may be instances when Twitgoo
may access or disclose PII or non-PII without providing you with a choice in
order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Twitgoo, our
Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement
of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Users of the Twitgoo
Services or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances;
(iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply
with the law or legal process. In addition, if Twitgoo sells all or part of
its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its
assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material
part of its business, Twitgoo may transfer your PII to the party or parties
involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If you register to use the
Site, you may designate your Profile as "Private".<b><i> </i></b>Profiles designated
as "Private" will not be accessible to anyone but the Member although
individual images or video may still be viewable by anyone with access to the
URL associated with the image or video (whether on Twitgoo or as displayed
elsewhere via the quick link feature). <br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>SECURITY: <span style="text-transform:uppercase">Twitgoo</span> PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twitgoo uses commercially
reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to
safeguard PII and credit card information in its possession against loss, theft
and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Twitgoo uses
reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and
appropriately complete. </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>ACCESS, REMEDIES AND
COMPLIANCE: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR CHANGE YOUR PREFERENCES REGARDING YOUR
PII AND HOW TO CONTACT <span style="text-transform:uppercase">Twitgoo</span>
ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Whenever possible, Twitgoo
Members may review the Registration PII we maintain about them in our records. We
will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a Member informs us is incorrect.
If you are a Member, you can view and change your Registration PII, Member
preferences and Profile Information by logging into the settings portion of
your Twitgoo account.</span></p>
