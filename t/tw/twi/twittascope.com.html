<p>Tarot.com may gather information for the following reasons:</p>

<h3>Account Creation</h3>
<p>When creating an account while using this website, we request certain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from you on the registration form. During registration you [are required to] give contact information such as your first name, email address, and password in order to customize and protect what are essentially private experiences. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.</p><p>

</p><p>You have the option to provide demographic information (such as gender and birth date) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. We collect personal information to allow us to personalize Horoscopes, <a href="/readings-reports" target="_blank">Astrology and Numerology reports, Tarot and I Ching readings</a> — while also providing ways for you to customize your experience on our website. We take extraordinary precautions to keep all customer information, including email addresses, secure. We want you to be able to use our site as a personal resource for as long as you want, with complete confidence. Your unique user login and password protect your stored readings and reports, so that you — and only you — can access them any time.</p>

<p>If you provide us with personal information about others, or if others give us your information, (for example a name and birth date to complete a reading) we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>

<h3>Customization/Preference Settings</h3>
<p>Based on your chosen settings, you may access custom readings and other special features of the site without having to log in each time. Registrants will enjoy the benefits of customization, based on preferences they have specified to the website (for saved readings, a favorite Tarot deck, etc.).</p>

<p>Subscribe to our Emails and Newsletters: We Adhere to a Strict Anti-Spam Policy</p>

<p>At Tarot.com we are 100 percent committed to protecting your privacy. We won’t send you emails if you don’t want to receive them, either.</p>

<p>When you first <a href="/signup">sign up on our sites</a>, we send out an email welcoming you and confirming your login name and password. Unless you choose to unsubscribe — which you can do from within that email — you will also receive an occasional Special News email from Tarot.com. This is our way of notifying you about free readings, special gift offers, new reports or feature updates.

<more-today class="tarot-widget" scope="[&quot;If we accept a cosmic invitation to explore our emotional depths today, we'll be able to perceive our love life circumstances with more clarity than usual. Mental Mercury opposes private Pluto, inspiring us to delve into our subconscious desires related to love. The Sun's square to wounded Chiron shows us the power of forgiveness to move our relationships forward. Meanwhile, the metamorphic Scorpio Moon's alignment with jumping Jupiter and ethereal Neptune portends a positive result in matters of the heart, as long as we try to understand the shadows that occasionally attempt to block the light.&quot;,&quot;A chance meeting with an ex-lover can spark some big emotions as you start to look backwards at your former affair with nostalgia and possibly regret. No amount of recollections will bring back the past or allow you to fix mistakes, but this encounter can help reframe your perspective about an old love connection and allow you to find closure. Consider this your cosmic call to let go of yesterday because tomorrow is where you will find all of the passionate potential in your romantic world right now.&quot;,&quot;Something you recently believed to be true about someone in your love life is now in question, creating a whole new paradigm of curious perspectives about your romantic connection. You're not that keen on changing your mind once you make a decision, but since there is new information to consider at this moment, you're open to accepting the changing paradigms right now. The fact that you're willing to embrace a certain amount of uncertainty means that your confidence about love is growing now.&quot;,&quot;Once you head down an unexplored path in your love life, you may not be able to do a one-eighty and reverse course, so be prepared to continue moving forward right now. You probably won't even want to go back to where you started, because experiencing a new adventure in matters of the heart is exactly what you crave today. There may even be occasional moments of stress as you realize that not every twist and turn will be positive but you're eager to take the bad with the good at this time, knowing it's all part of your journey of love.&quot;,&quot;In your attempt to just live and let live when you and your lover experience a romantic row today, you may be sending a signal that you're not willing to stand up for what you believe in, but of course this isn't the case: The truth is, you may be acting in the wisest manner right now as you let your intuition guide you on engaging in a tense moment is worth it -- because it usually is not. But if you are convinced in your heart that initiating a cleansing conversation will help, take a chance, but remain compassionate, respectful and kind.&quot;,&quot;A misunderstanding leading to a missed date could send your love relationship spinning out of control today. Perhaps your schedule just doesn't have room in it at the moment, or perhaps something urgent takes priority over romance. Whatever the case may be, be very careful not to make it look as if you're not interested in your sweetheart's plans. Do your best to apologize if your lover deserves it and make sure to be your most authentic self when you explain the realities of your busy world in a thoughtful manner right now.&quot;,&quot;Even if you say more than necessary to a lover today, you'll be speaking from the heart and that's the important thing. Sharing your perspective on a matter that means a lot to you both is a good idea, especially if it builds trust in your love relationship at this moment. You want to share yourself with your sweetheart and the more you feel this way, the more you're inspired to always be humble and grateful for what you have right now. &quot;,&quot;If a lover doesn't pay enough attention to you, you're not going to let that stop you from bringing up an important subject if you believe you need to talk about it today. The unknown also doesn't scare you as it used to, because you're bold enough to step into mysterious situations where the outcome is unknown, knowing that this is part of love's great unfolding. The future of your love life feels like an open book to you right now -- it's getting stuck back in the pages of the past that makes you cringe.&quot;,&quot;When it comes to tricky matters of the heart, powerful Pluto has your back today, even if you have to face shadowy energy with the one you love. There are romantic mysteries at play at the moment, but you're unafraid of where your passionate quest will lead you because you're open and eager to embrace the unknown with fearless resolve right now. If you hit a pothole on this journey, you will find a way to correct course and not lose your way.&quot;,&quot;Figuring out a way to keep certain thoughts to yourself would bode well in your current love relationship dilemma, especially if your situation is still evolving right now. You just don't want to fess up to your thoughts while they're still forming, especially if there's a chance that you and your significant other can compromise to reach an agreement today. Taking moments to yourself to ponder the situation is a good move, because silence can really help you think and feel deeply.&quot;,&quot;New revelations come to you as you get secret information from a lover's pillow talk confessions today, However, you're not sure how to respond to what you learn and you may find yourself fumbling for words as a result. This isn't a good time to made decisions no matter how passionate you feel at the moment. Be patient, grasshopper! Within a day or two you'll be clear on how to proceed. For now, just observe your feelings as they evolve.&quot;,&quot;Your ability to see the big picture may be impeded by your desire to focus on the tiniest aspects of a special love relationship situation today. Just because you have something specific you want to deal with right now doesn't mean you should lose sight of the long-term repercussions of your actions. As good as your attention to detail is at this moment, reminding yourself of what you're doing it all for will serve you well.&quot;,&quot;Even if a lover does everything in their power to invite you to take the next step in your love connection, you will only do so when you're truly ready. You're at a point where you want to creatively share your deepest feelings with the one you love at this time, but you're also positive that you do not want to rush the process of deepening your love relationship. You're in charge of the timeline right now, and your lover knows it. &quot;]" psychic="    <strong>LITTLE THINGS</strong><br/>If you are in a relationship, look for the little thing…
