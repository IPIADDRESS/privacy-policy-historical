					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
  					Effective November, 2010
  					</p>
  					<p>
  					Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes Twylah's policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.twylah.com (this "Site").  Site access is made available to you subject to your compliance with the Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”), available at <a href="/tos.html">twylah.com/tos</a>, and this Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site.
  					</p>
  					<strong>Acceptance of the Privacy Policy</strong>
  					<p>
  					This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Terms of Service, which are available at <a href="/tos.html">twylah.com/tos</a>.  By visiting and using the Site, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and represent and warrant that you have the legal right to do so on your behalf, and you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by Twylah in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  					IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE TERMS OF SERVICE, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE TWYLAH WITH ANY INFORMATION AND DO NOT USE THE SITE.
  					</p>
  					<strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong>
  					<p>
  					Our Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, and we will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. Any change or modification made by Twylah will be effective immediately upon being posted on the Site.  Your continued use of the Site after any changes or modifications to this Privacy Policy are posted will constitute your acceptance of the changes or modifications.  Changes can be viewed by clicking on the Privacy Policy link on the Site, and Twylah encourages you to do so, and to review this Privacy Policy, from time to time.
  					</p>
  					<strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
  					<p>
  					You may be able to visit portions of the Site without providing Twylah any personally identifiable information.  When you visit or browse the Site, although Twylah does not automatically collect personally identifiable information, Twylah may automatically collect and record information about your visit (through the use of cookies and otherwise) as part of its analysis of the use of the Site and its performance.  For example, when a web page is requested from the Site, Twylah may record the time, date and URL of the request and information on the browser being used.  These data may be aggregated to enable Twylah to analyze trends, administer the Site, and gather information regarding where visits to the Site originate, how often the Site is visited and what parts of the Site are visited most often.  These data may also be linked to your User Account and your personal information to personally identify you to enhance user experiences, track topic areas you have navigated to, provide you with targeted ads or, should you opt in to topical newsletters, deliver customized newsletters.  
  					</p>
  					<p>
  					Twylah may require you to register for a user account (a “User Account”) in order to use portions of the Site or its functionalities.  In order to register for a User Account, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information and other information (“Account Information”).  Types of personally identifiable and other information that we may require for you to establish register and create a User Account include: personal information (e.g., name, postal address, mobile telephone number, email address and user name and password), company information (e.g., company name, company postal address, company telephone number and company website) and demographic information (e.g., membership in other websites).  You are the sole custodian of your User Account and are responsible for the accuracy of your Account Information.  You agree that Twylah is only a facilitator of the Site and has no responsibility for the accuracy of your Account Information.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  					YOU MAY, AT ANY TIME, REVIEW AND UPDATE, OR REQUEST THAT TWYLAH DELETE, THE ACCOUNT INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO TWYLAH THROUGH THE SITE BY EDITING IT IN YOUR USER ACCOUNT OR CONTACTING TWYLAH AS INDICATED BELOW. 
  					</p>
  					<p>
  					Twylah may also collect personally identifiable information that you submit to other sections of or through other functionality made available on the Site.  For example, but without limitation, Twylah may collect personal information that you post to the Posting Areas, provide in connection with feedback or requests for contact submitted to Twylah, or, if you choose to participate in various Twylah activities like newsletters, sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to Twylah for review. Twylah users may also choose to provide or store non-personally identifiable information in their User Account profiles. Such information, together with your Account Information, is referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as “Your Information.” 
  					<br>
  					Any information gathered by Twylah is used to customize the Twylah experience, and is not shared or sold to any third parties, except as expressly provided for in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

This will only be done as necessary and these posts will never be shared by anyone else.

  					We will display Your Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want all other Twylah users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage users to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. Twylah does not assume any responsibility or liability for (i) any information you submit to the Site or (ii) your or third parties' use or misuse of information transmitted or received using the Site.  You can review and revise your profile information at any time.

By registering for Optional Information, you acknowledge and agree that Twylah may display or otherwise provide you with such Optional Information using contact information in your User Account.
