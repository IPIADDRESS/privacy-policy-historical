  <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
  <p>Last Updated: October 23, 2009</p>
  <p>TweetGlide  strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet  technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.  We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail  address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this  privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address  to any unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
  <p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
  <p>How  we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services  provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you  register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain  features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may  provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,  message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.  Like most Web sites, TweetGlide also collects information automatically  and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our  visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service  Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information  from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user  name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information  each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a  particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt  additional technology, we may also gather information through other  means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with  information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept  cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of  the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and  we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your  preferences.</p>
  <p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
  <p>Like  other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your  privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
  <p>Aggregated  Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be  used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to  help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are  visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated  Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and  business partners. Again, this information does not include any  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.</p>
  <p>We  may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on TweetGlide to  communicate with you about your registration and customization  preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and  products offered by TweetGlide and other topics we think you might find  of interest. </p>
  <p>Personally  Identifiable Information collected by TweetGlide may also be used for  other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,  troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration  of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain  third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our  site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.  We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,  from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell,  buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such  transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We  may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at  other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,  in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or  to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or  necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to  disclosure in such cases.</p>
  <p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
  <p>TweetGlide  expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy  of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our  partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers  accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data  collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to  our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a TweetGlide  page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third  party. Also, through TweetGlide you may be introduced to, or be able to  access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes  offered by other parties. TweetGlide is not responsible for the actions  or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable  privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a  feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
  <p>While  on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third  parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some  of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example,  some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include  cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a  particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site  may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or  other technology to gather information. TweetGlide does not control the  use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information,  and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third  parties.</p>
  <p>You should  also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable  Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be  viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without  our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other  individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of  TweetGlide and this policy.</p>
  <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
  <p>TweetGlide  does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable  Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law.  If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13  in violation of this policy, we will delete that information  immediately. If you believe TweetGlide has any information from or  about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>

  <p>Changes to this Policy</p>
  <p>TweetGlide  reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this  page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following  the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those  changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted  will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time  the information was collected.</p>
  <p><strong>Governing law</strong></p>
  <p>This  policy and the use of this Site are governed by New York law. If a  dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it  with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following  location: Suffolk County. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees  associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
  <p>If  it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution  through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding  arbitration at the following location: Suffolk County, under the rules  of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award  rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with  jurisdiction to do so.</p>
  <p>TweetGlide  is controlled, operated and administered entirely within New York. This  statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do  not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any  party.</p>
