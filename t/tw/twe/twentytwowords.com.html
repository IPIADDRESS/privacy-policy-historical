</ul>
<p class="p4"><b>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</b></p>
<p class="p8">Some of the User Information is collected on the sites through the use of Cookies and/or Web Beacons.&nbsp;<b>“Cookies”</b>&nbsp;are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your computer or mobile web browser that allow us, and third parties with whom we partner, to recognize your browser or mobile device and transfer information about you and your use of our sites. For example, Cookies that we use tell us how many times you have visited one of our sites, your search preferences, and if you have clicked on an advertisement that has been displayed to you. We use “persistent” Cookies to save your login information for future logins to our sites. We also use “session ID” Cookies to enable certain features of the sites, to better understand how you interact with the sites and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the sites. Unlike persistent Cookies, session ID Cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from a site and close your browser.</p>
<p class="p8">We (and third parties with whom we partner) may also deliver a file known as a web beacon, pixel or pixel tag (i.e.,&nbsp;<b>“Web Beacons”</b>) to you through our sites. Web Beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the site interface or in emails relating to the site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the site interface, such as to count visits, access Cookies, understand usage effectiveness and to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon.&nbsp;<b>“Pixels”</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>“Pixel Tags”</b>&nbsp;also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight, tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user’s computer to a third party website. We (and third parties with whom we partner) may deliver Web Beacons or Pixel Tags to you through our sites. Web Beacons allow ad networks, marketing partners and other service providers that we use to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us, for advertisers and our other partners. Web Beacons also enable ad networks and other partners to track your behavior for their own analysis and use, and to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites or platforms. These Web Beacons enable third party companies to view, edit, or set their own Cookies when you visit the site, just as if you had visited a web page from their site.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
<p class="p2">The Data concerning the User is collected to allow us to improve our User Experience and Site Performance, as well as for the following purposes: Contacting the User and Analytics.</p>

<p class="p8">Our third party vendors and partners use your User Information to display ads on both the sites and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively,&nbsp;“Channels”).

These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the site with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the site or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the site based on your interaction with the site and other Channels.</p>

<p class="p8">In order to help us sell advertising on the sites and otherwise publicize BRAINJOLT and its Owned and Operated sites, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience.
