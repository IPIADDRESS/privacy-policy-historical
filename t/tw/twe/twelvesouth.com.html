<ul>
<li><strong>Disclosures without your consent.</strong> We may disclose your personal data in response to subpoenas, warrants, court orders or other legal process, or to comply with relevant laws or regulatory investigations when we believe in good faith that applicable law requires it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also share your personal data in order to establish or exercise our legal rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, enforce, or take other action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to the safety of person or property, or a violation of our terms, policies, or agreements, and to collect amounts lawfully owed to us.</li>

<li><strong>Employees, business affiliates, and intermediaries.&nbsp;</strong>We disclose your personally identifiable information to our affiliates, subsidiaries, or divisions and their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, attorneys, and agents, or with our business partners, all of whom are bound by all of the confidentiality and other data processing protections and practices described in this Policy, use your information strictly to carry out their job duties on a need-to-know basis, and only do so as required by law and as required by our legitimate interests.</li>
<li><strong>Mailing list and newsletters.&nbsp;</strong>When you sign up for one of our mailing lists or newsletters, we disclose your contact information, including your name, company name, email address, postal address, and telephone, as necessary to complete and process your sign up and manage your subscription.</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Website is developed and supported by third party vendors, who may, in the course of performing such services for us (such as hosting, developing, or updating our website), have access to your personally identifiable information.&nbsp;&nbsp;We contractually require such vendors to maintain the confidentiality of your information, and take appropriate measures to keep it secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;We prohibit such vendors from using or disclosing your information for any purpose other than in performing specific services requested by us on your behalf, to administer our Website, or to comply with applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also may use Service Providers to help us administer and provide services or products requested by you as well as provide technical support, send marketing and promotions and communicate with you about our products and services, resolve payment and delivery processing issues, and other legitimate purposes permitted by law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Corporate change.&nbsp;</strong>We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, without your permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an event, personally identifiable information may among the assets transferred.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated data.&nbsp;</strong>We may disclose aggregated information about you to third parties (including, without limitation, advertisers, media, and actual or potential partners or investors) for informational, new product development, marketing, and/or promotional purposes, without seeking additional consent from you, when such aggregated information does not identify you or any specific individual, as is the case with groupings of demographic data and customer preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>How Long Do We Store Your Personal Information?&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>We will retain your personal information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will retain and use your personal information as long as necessary to comply with our business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, provide our services, and enforce our agreements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we no longer have a purpose to retain your personal information, we will securely destroy your personal information in accordance with applicable law and our policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we collect if your registration to use our Website lapses and you opt out of receiving further communications from us, or if you ask us to delete your information, unless we determine that doing so would violate our existing, legitimate legal, regulatory, dispute resolution, contractual, or similar obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may retain and use anonymous and aggregated information for performance reporting, benchmarking, and analytic purposes and for product and service improvement.</p>
<p><u>Responding to Your Personal Information Requests</u></p>
<p>We use commercially respond efforts to respond to all legitimate requests related to our processing of personal information within one month, unless a faster response is required by law. It also could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be circumstances in which we need to ask you for more information to identify your account and verify your identity or else we may be unable to provide you with access to your personal information, including, but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and contact information to address any further inquiries you may have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timeframes described here do not apply to our response times for addressing ordinary customer service and support requests unrelated to the exercise of personal information access rights.</p>
<p><u>Security of Your Personal Information</u></p>
<p>We maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent your personal information under our control from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized manner, altered or disclosed during collection, storage, and processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular safeguards used to protect personal information depend on the sensitivity of the personal information, the amount, distribution and format of the information, and the method of storage.</p>
<p>By using the Service or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice within the Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to your account and personal data and information is restricted within our organization to employees and trusted partners that need access to your personal information in order to correspond with you and provide the products and/or services that you requested from us.</p>
<p>While our security measures seek to protect your personal information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances or that any privacy settings or security measures used in connection with the Services cannot be circumvented.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to circumvent those measures or other safeguards in use, or access and/or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p>
<p>The majority of communications on our Services, including any submissions through available forms, are sent through the standard HTTP protocol and may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP is not encrypted. E-mail, while convenient, does pose some risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;Any transmission of information that you make through our Services is at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access to restricted parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not share your password with anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Services or systems that compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by applicable law.&nbsp;</p>

There are certain exceptions to this right, however, so that we may deny access to you as required by law or to protect the legal rights of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right to Portability.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to request that some of your personal data is provided to you or an authorized third party in a commonly-used, machine-readable format. You can request a download of your account information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to keep your personal information accurate, current and complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please contact us if you believe your information is not accurate or changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right to Object</strong>. In certain circumstances, as permitted under applicable law, you have the right to object to processing of your personal information and to ask us to erase or restrict our use of your personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like us to stop using your personal information, please contact us and we will let you know if are able to agree to your request.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right to Erasure and Deletion of Your Personal Information.</strong> You may have a legal right (for instance, if you are located in the EU or EEA under the GDPR) to request that we delete your personal information when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when, among other things, your personal information has been unlawfully processed.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also may decide to delete your personal information if we believe it is incomplete, inaccurate or that our continued storage of your personal information is contrary to our legal obligations or business objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active servers and databases and our Website, as applicable, but it may remain in our archive if it is not practical or possible to delete it.&nbsp;We may also retain your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce any agreements with you.&nbsp;</p>

Withdrawal of consent to receive marketing communications will not affect the processing of personal information for the provision of our services.</p>

We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding important updates to this Policy) unless you delete your entire user profile.</p>
<p><strong>Changes To Our Policy.</strong>&nbsp;We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update, change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will post the new Policy on this page with a notice that an update has occurred and notify you at the email address specified in your account or use an in-app alert the first time you use the mobile application after we make the change. You are responsible for providing us with an active, up-to-date, and deliverable email address for contacting you. It also is your responsibility to&nbsp;carefully&nbsp;review this Policy &nbsp;prior to using the Services and from time to time so you are aware of any changes. The date this Policy was last revised is identified in its header.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law.</strong>&nbsp;This Policy and any disputes related thereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of its choice of law rules.</p>
