	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Tweetworks, LLC owns and operates the web site tweetworks.com (the "Site"). This document describes Tweetworks' policies concerning the use of personal information of Members collected via the Site ("Privacy Policy") as in effect on October 29, 2008.</p>

<p>We reserve the right, in our discretion, to change, modify and delete provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time. If we do change how we use personally identifiable information (or make other changes to this Policy), we will post the changes on this page or email you a notice, in each case indicating the effective date, so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Your continued use of the Site after such notice constitutes your acceptance of the modified Policy.</p>

<h3>Information Collection And Use</h3>
<p>To have access to the Site's features and services, you must register as a Member. This requires that you provide your Twitter screen name and password, an active email address, and for certain services a Tweetworks screen name and password (which may be the same as your Twitter information), and that you agree to be bound by the Site Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Having your Twitter name and password enables us to pass your tweets directly to Twitter, while storing them for future use (e.g., maintaining group discussions and threaded conversations). If you would like to sponsor a group or access our premium services, we will require additional information, including credit or debit card numbers, to process payment and maintain your account.</p>

<p>Once provided, Tweetworks retains the right to use your email address for communication and other purposes, even if you cancel membership, as described more completely below.</p>

<p>As a Member you will also have the option of including other information in a Member Profile, such as your home or business address. Member Profiles can be found by other Members via either a Member search or other means.  Other than your user name, you may elect to restrict access to information about yourself so that it is not viewable by any other Member or so that it is only viewable by Members that belong to Member Groups to which you also belong. Providing extra information may help you connect with more relevant people and opportunities; but it remains optional and you can later elect to revise or remove this data.</p>

<p>While you remain a Member, you can use the "My Profile" page to edit or delete information from your Member Profile. When you terminate your membership you can remove your Member Profile from the Site; however, any tweets that you posted for Member viewing may remain available for such viewing by Members, and associated with your screen name, even after you cease to be a Member. However, other Members who click on your screen name after you terminate membership will receive a message that you are inactive.</p>

<p>Tweetworks is the sole owner of the data and information collected on this Site, except for Personal Content (see the Terms of Use) and excluding your Twitter names and passwords. We may track your activities and use the information you contribute for administration of the Site; to contact you about new services, features and changes on our Site; for the purpose of internal review and analysis; and for external sanitized (i.e. not personally identifiable) studies and reports. We can use your personal information as authorized until you cease to be a Member or you notify us that you are withdrawing this authorization (and for 30 days after, to provide us sufficient time to remove your information from our databases, mailing lists and the like).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the above, once you provide an email address, we retain that address, and the right to use it, indefinitely, except as may be provided by law.</p>

<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>We may engage service providers to perform various necessary functions, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and storing our data. We will share your personally identifiable information with these parties only as needed for them to perform their duties efficiently and only after they agree to treat your personal information as confidential and confirm that they use reasonable security measure to guard against disclosure or misuse.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>The personal information you provide us may also be given to law enforcement officials if we believe we must do so to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court order, or other valid legal process. We may also disclose personally identifiable information when we conclude that disclosing it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or to protect the safety or security of our Members, our company or the general public.</p>

<h3>Cookies and Log Files</h3>
<p>We use cookies and log files to administer the Site. A log file is a list of recent actions that is maintained by our servers. A cookie is a piece of data that we store on your hard drive and that may contain information about you and your computer. This promotes ease of communication between your computer and the Site and enables us to target relevant announcements and promotional material to Members. (You may be able to use your computer's control panel to disable cookies; but doing so may affect your ease in using the Site.)</p>

<p>We have no access to or control over any cookies that may be used by linked or other third party sites.</p>

<h3>Sharing</h3>
<p>Understandably, our affiliates, partners and advertisers may want to know about the demographics and characteristics of our Members. Therefore, we may share aggregated demographic information data with them. This is group data that breaks down information about the broad characteristics of our users and is not linked to any personal information that can identify individual persons.</p>

<p>We may partner with another party to provide specific services. If so, we can give your email address to this provider so it can contact you, but we will not share other personally identifiable information without your permission.</p>

<p>However, if Tweetworks, LLC is sold to a new owner, whether by merger, stock sale, asset sale or other means, we retain the right to transfer your Member Profile, Personal Content, and other data and information to this new owner, provided the owner agrees to respect the Privacy Policy in effect with respect to this personal data.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>This Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Tweetworks cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, including those to which we link or whose products or services we reference, such as Twitter. We encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy statements of each Web site you visit. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Site.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Tweetworks and this Site use reasonable security measures to protect against misuse or unauthorized disclosure of your personal information, including the encryption of your username and passwords, but Tweetworks does not take special precautions, such as secure socket layers, to protect information from unauthorized tampering.</p>

<h3>Advertising; Special Offers; Updates</h3>
<p>Members will be eligible to receive advertising, promotions and information about our own or third parties' products and services. We may also send you Site updates and information about new features of the Site. We may communicate with you via email to provide requested services, and in regard to issues relating to your account. You will be allowed to opt out of these communications, except those relating to new features or changes to the Site or to issues regarding your account.</p>

<h3>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</h3>
<p>If you wish to correct, update or remove any personal data in your Member Profile, you may do so at any time by using the My Profile page. If you have already registered but want to be removed completely from our database, please email <a href="mailto:help@tweetworks.com">help@tweetworks.com</a>. However, as noted above, any tweets that you post for viewing by other Members generally remain available for such viewing, and associated with your screen name, even after you cease to be a Member.</p>

<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>If you have questions about our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:privacyhelp@tweetworks.com">privacy@tweetworks.com</a>.</p>
