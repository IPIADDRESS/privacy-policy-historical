            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Gravity4, Inc. (“Gravity4”, “we” or “us”) on the
                collection, use and disclosure of information about you on <a href="http://www.tr.im">http://www.tr.im</a>
                (the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications offered by Tr.im (collectively with the Site,
                “Tr.im”, the “Services”).
                Tr.im receives information about you from various sources, such as: (i) when you register for the Site and
                the Services, through your user account with Tr.im (your “Account”); (ii) when you use the Services; and (iii)
                from third party websites and services, including other applications and Services owned by Gravity4.
                When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure and other uses
                of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. The information you provide may be transferred,
                processed and/or accessed by us in the United States or another country where we
                (or our service providers) operate.
            </p>

            <h2 class="numbered">
                What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
            </h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of the information gathered by Tr.im when you are using or accessing
                the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers Tr.im’s treatment of any information about you that Tr.im’s
                business partners share with Tr.im or that Tr.im shares with its business partners, or that Tr.im shares with
                other Gravity4 applications or services.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that Tr.im or Gravity4 does not own or
                control, including other companies’ websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you can
                access through the Services, such as Facebook or Twitter, or to individuals that Tr.im or Gravity4 does not
                manage or employ. While we attempt to partner with only those Third Party Services that share our respect for
                your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services.
                We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.

                What Information Does Tr.im Collect and How is it Used?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The information we collect is primarily used to provide the Services, to process and complete any transactions,
                to respond to inquiries, to personalize and improve the Services, to monitor and analyze usage and trends of the
                Services, to provide you with related, relevant information, and for any other purpose for which the information
                was collected. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some
                information about you. We collect the following types of information from our users.
            </p>
            <h3 class="numbered">
                User Information:
            </h3>
            <p>
                When you create an Account, we will collect personal information from you, such as your name and email address.
                If you create an Account using your login from another account, such as Facebook or Twitter, we will access and
                collect the personal information about you that the account provides (which is based on your privacy settings),
                so that you can create your Account with us. We use your contact information to send you information about our
                Services. You may unsubscribe from receiving certain types of these messages through your Account settings,
                although Tr.im and Gravity4 reserves the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for
                administrative and account management purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Note regarding children:</i> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have
                collected personal information of a child under 13, we will take necessary steps to delete such information from our
                systems upon notification.
            </p>
            <h3 class="numbered">
                URL Information:
            </h3>
            <p>
                One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs) of websites
                (“Tr.im Links”, or “tr.ims”). Tr.im collects and stores both the original URL and the shortened URL and, if you
                are logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your Account. Tr.im also collects and stores
                the time and date on which you shortened the original URL and when you share the Tr.im Link, information on the
                channels through which the Tr.im Link was shared.
            </p>
            <h3 class="numbered">
                Metrics and Analytics:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Tr.im collects information about accesses (such as clicks) of every Tr.im Link created through the Services.
                This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and physical location of the devices accessing
                the Tr.im Link; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; and (iv) information
                about sharing of the Tr.im Link on Third Party Services such as Twitter and Facebook. These metrics and analytics
                are used by Tr.im and its partners to improve their websites and services by, for example, providing value-added features.
            </p>
            <h3 class="numbered">
                User Content:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written descriptions of URLs,
                comments, images and video. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by Tr.im, even after you
                terminate your account, and may continue to be shared by third parties, as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="numbered">
                Information Collected From Third Party Services:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some features of the Services allow you to share your content and Tr.im Links through your accounts with other
                companies such as Gravity4, other Gravity4 applications and services, Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to
                connect Tr.im to such Third Party Services, we may collect information related to your use of those Third Party
                Services, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts or the
                contact information of your friends (if you choose to connect your friends, followers, or contacts from your account)
                so that you can contact these people when you use the Services. We may also collect information about how you are
                using the Services to interact with those connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services may have
                the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us based on your privacy settings of that account.

                    <li>
                        Tr.im automatically receives and records information from your web browser when you interact with the
                        Services, such as your IP address, browser type, your general location and cookie information. This
                        information may be used to help us understand how users transit a website, to fight spam/malware,
                        to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what Tr.im Links
                        you have clicked on) and for other similar purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tr.im also automatically receives and records information that your mobile device transmits when you
                        access the Services, like a device identifier, device settings, and operating system. This information
                        is used to facilitate your access and use of the Services, to access and use other Third Party Services,
                        and for other similar purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of
                        visitors to the Site. Tr.im may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure,
                        but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third
                        parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can
                        analyze and improve them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will collect information about your general location (such as your city and state) when you visit the
                        Site (which is derived from your IP address) and we may use various technologies to determine your location
                        (if you enable this feature), when you access and use the Services through a mobile device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our

                        Tr.im cookies also allow Tr.im to track when you have clicked on a Tr.im Link. Each click of a Tr.im
                        Link is tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more cookies stored by your web
                        browser and associated with Tr.im.

                        We do, however, use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed a Tr.im Link and may associate
                        that information with your Account if you have one.

                    <li>
                        Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
                        accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you
                        to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you will not be
                        able use most features of the Services. Tr.im cookies are set to automatically expire after 6 months from
                        when they are set.

                While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not shared publicly. We do at times,
                however, share IP address information with our partners, service providers and other companies with whom we
                conduct business. In most cases, when we share your IP address with other third parties, we will use a cryptographic
                hash of the IP address, which cannot feasibly be reversed into the actual IP addresses themselves or linked to you
                individually.

                When creating a Tr.im Link, you can share that Tr.im Link through Third Party Services. Any information that you
                elect to distribute through Third Party Services is provided to them and may then become accessible to users of

                links in the Statistics page for a Tr.im Link. We recommend that you review the terms of services and privacy
                policies of such Third Party Services that you access through the Services, since Tr.im does not control nor is
                responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Services.
