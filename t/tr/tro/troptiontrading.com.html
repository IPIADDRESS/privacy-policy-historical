						<p>Privacy Statement:</p>
<p>TroptionTrading.com privacy notice</p>
<p>GlobalTroption Partners, Inc. (“gtp.dobarter.com”) has written this</p>
<p>statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting</p>
<p>your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and</p>
<p>dissemination practices for this website. As this policy may change</p>
<p>from time to time, please check back periodically.</p>
<p>Troptiontrading.com uses the information we collect about you to process orders.</p>
<p>When you register at Troptiontrading.com, we collect your name, email addresses,</p>
<p>mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date in order to</p>
<p>process and fulfill your order. In some instances, products ordered at</p>
<p>Troptiontrading.com are shipped directly from our vendors, and some of your</p>
<p>information is shared with these vendors to enable them to fulfill and</p>
<p>ship your order.</p>
<p>When you sign up for Troptiontrading.com Auction Alerts, we need only an email</p>
<p>address to send you the email topics that you have selected. We also</p>
<p>use your email address to send you email notice of your bid and order</p>
<p>status, and we may use your email address to send you notice of</p>
<p>upgrades or changes to Troptiontrading.com, new services, and special offers. You</p>
<p>may choose not to receive any of these emails when you register, or at</p>
<p>a later date, by accessing Troptiontrading.com Auction Alerts.</p>
<p>We occasionally will ask for additional information from you. For</p>
<p>instance, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address in</p>
<p>connection with a contest or other promotional feature in which you</p>
<p>participate, so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We</p>
<p>may offer contests or promotions with third parties; policies</p>
<p>concerning use of your personal data gathered in connection with any</p>
<p>such contest or promotion will be specifically set forth in the rules</p>
<p>and policies applicable to the contest or promotion.</p>
<p>Troptiontrading.com offers a service called “Tell a Friend” that allows you to</p>
<p>notify friends about open auctions. If you choose to use our referral</p>
<p>service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your</p>
<p>friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your</p>
<p>friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do</p>
<p>not save or share your buddies email address, they are only used for</p>
<p>this one time mailing. Please note, however, that Troptiontrading.com opposes the</p>
<p>practice of sending unsolicited commercial emails, also known as</p>
<p>“spam”. Therefore, we request that you send “Tell A Friend” emails</p>
<p>only to people known by you who may be interested in the auction. If</p>
<p>someone asks you not to send these emails to him or her, please</p>
<p>comply.</p>
<p>When you bid on an item, you must enter the amount of your bid, your</p>
<p>Troptiontrading.com Login ID and your password. Only your initials, city and</p>
<p>state and your bid will be publicly available in the Current Winning</p>
<p>Bids history.</p>

<p>with all applicable local laws and rules regarding online conduct and</p>
<p>privacy, as well as content. Specifically, but not as a limitation,</p>
<p>you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding transmission of</p>
<p>technical and personal data exported from the United States or the</p>
<p>country in which you reside.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>“Cookies” are pieces of information that are passed to your browser</p>
<p>and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Troptiontrading.com uses cookies to</p>
<p>recognize repeat visitors, to automatically enter your login ID in our</p>
<p>bid form, and to provide additional features to make bidding &amp; buying</p>
<p>at Troptiontrading.com easier and more efficient. If you do not wish to receive</p>
<p>cookies, you can turn them off using your browser’s settings . We do</p>

<p>Sharing data with third parties</p>
<p>Upon registration with Troptiontrading.com each of our customers is</p>
<p>assigned a random and anonymous customer number, which we use to track</p>
<p>customer orders. This customer number is different from any custom</p>
<p>login ID selected by you and may be passed to third party vendors with</p>
<p>whom we work to provide more efficient and relevant services to our</p>
<p>users. Our anonymous customer numbers may be used to measure traffic</p>
<p>and visiting patterns on Troptiontrading.com and on other websites on the</p>
<p>Internet. We may also compile statistics and other data about our</p>
<p>customers on an aggregated basis, and may share such aggregated data</p>
<p>with selected third parties. Troptiontrading.com can (and you authorize us to)</p>
<p>release any information about you when we believe that such release is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to comply with law, enforce or apply the terms of</p>
<p>any of our user agreements, enforce other Troptiontrading.com rights, or protect</p>
<p>the rights, property or safety of Troptiontrading.com, the Troptiontrading.com Web site, our</p>
<p>users, or others. Further, as permitted by applicable law, Troptiontrading.com</p>
<p>can (and you authorize us to) disclose your login ID, name, street,</p>
<p>address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, company</p>
<p>and any other information in connection with an investigation of</p>
<p>fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful</p>
<p>activity whenever Troptiontrading.com in its sole discretion believes necessary</p>
<p>or appropriate. In the event GlobalTroption Partners, Inc. goes</p>
<p>through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by</p>
<p>another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your</p>
<p>personally identifiable information will likely be among assets</p>
<p>transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in</p>
<p>ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
<p>In addition, we may share information about you with third parties as</p>
<p>necessary to complete a transaction requested by you or to enable them</p>
<p>to provide special opportunities and offers to you. We may share</p>
<p>information about you with our business partners, affiliates or other</p>
<p>third parties with your approval only. If your personally identifiable</p>
<p>information changes, or if you no longer want us to share information</p>
<p>you provide with third parties, you may correct, update, or</p>
<p>unsubscribe by making the change in My Account located in My Page on</p>
<p>Troptiontrading.com</p>
<p>You may choose whether or not to receive Outbid and order processing</p>
<p>emails in My Account and in My Mailbox. By registering at Troptiontrading.com,</p>
<p>you consent to the collection and use of this information by Troptiontrading.com</p>
<p>for order processing, Auction Alert emails, or the sharing of your</p>
<p>personally identifiable information to our business partners (with</p>
<p>your consent only). In the event of changes in our privacy policy,</p>
<p>this page will be updated with the current information.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>This Web site may contain links to other web sites. We provide these</p>
<p>links for your convenience, but we do not review, control or monitor</p>
<p>the privacy practices of websites operated by others. We are not</p>
<p>responsible for the performance of these sites or for your business</p>
<p>dealings with them. Your use of other web sites is subject to the</p>
<p>terms and conditions of those web sites, including the privacy</p>
<p>policies of those web sites.</p>
<p>Children’s Privacy</p>
<p>This Web site is designed for an adult audience only, and children</p>
<p>should not use this Web site. We will not intentionally collect online</p>
<p>any personal information (such as a child’s name or e-mail address)</p>
<p>from children under the age of 18. If you think that we have collected</p>
<p>personal information from a child under the age of 18, please contact</p>
<p>us and we will address the issue.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>How your information is encrypted</p>
<p>There are certain areas on the site where you may enter and submit</p>
<p>additional information. Certain of these areas are encrypted using SSL</p>
<p>encrypted transmissions between your Web browser and our Web server.</p>
<p>This is designed to reduce the chance that someone (e.g. on your</p>
<p>network at work or at your Internet service provider) may try to</p>
<p>compromise your private information as it travels from your Web</p>
<p>browser to our secure server. You’ll know when transmitted data is</p>
<p>encrypted by a security notice when you enter an encrypted page, and</p>
<p>by the presence of an icon on your browser, either a key for Netscape</p>
<p>or a lock for Microsoft Internet Explorer. The pages where you submit</p>
<p>your account information, place a bid, and receive confirmation of a</p>
<p>successful bid are all encrypted. In order to keep the highest level</p>
<p>of security possible with your credit card information, we do not</p>
<p>store your full credit card number.</p>
<p>Protecting your login ID and password</p>
<p>Always keep your Troptiontrading.com account number and password secret. They are</p>
<p>your only identification for bidding purposes. If you receive</p>
<p>information about a bid you did not place, or questionable</p>
<p>communications regarding your account, please contact</p>
<p>TroptionTrading.com Customer Support immediately by email. One</p>
<p>potential way for someone to steal your login ID and password is if</p>
<p>you bookmark any area on MyPage or a bid submission page. This is a</p>
<p>concern if your browser is available to other people at work, home, or</p>
<p>especially if you use a browser at a public internet cafe. You should</p>
<p>not bookmark such pages and you should clear the browser cache and</p>
<p>quit the browser completely when you are done surfing</p>
<p>Troptiontrading.com We have also worked to protect you against such a</p>
<p>mistake. Even if someone obtains both your login ID and password, the</p>
<p>system is designed to restrict access to your credit card information</p>
<p>because that field is cleared when they log in to My Page.</p>
<p>About SSL, security, and firewall problems</p>
<p>Some older browsers (such as IE 3.0.2) have known SSL bugs. These can</p>
<p>result in the browser crashing on SSL pages or giving error messages.</p>
<p>We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of whatever</p>
<p>browser you prefer. For AOL users, you may be able to upgrade your</p>
<p>security by downloading and replacing the schannel.dll from Microsoft.</p>
<p>For users behind corporate firewalls, you need to configure your web</p>
<p>browser security settings. This includes setting https or secure proxy</p>
<p>settings. To determine if you have such a security problem, you can</p>
<p>edit a secure URL, replacing ‘https’ (secure) with ‘http’ (insecure).</p>
<p>If the page works with http:// but not https://, then you have a</p>
<p>problem with your security settings. You should contact your system</p>
<p>administrator for assistance.</p>
<p>Technical Details About Encryption</p>
