    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div id="container">
      <div id="content">
      	<p>Effective Date January 19, 2010</p>
      	<p>The web site you have entered is operated by or on behalf of Tropicana Products, Inc. (“Tropicana”), a division of PepsiCo, Inc. Tropicana is committed to protecting your personal privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the types of personal information (“Personal Information” ) that are collected by Tropicana on this web site, and how we use and protect it. This Policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used. This Policy applies only to Tropicana web sites on which it is posted, and it does not apply to banners, sweepstakes and other advertisements or promotions that we may sponsor or participate in on web sites owned by third parties. </p>
      	<h3>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      	<p>By using this site, you signify that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use. If you do not agree with any term in this Policy or our Terms of Use, please do not use this site or provide any Personal Information to us. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is January 19, 2010. From time to time, this site may change, and/or our practices with respect to how we collect, use or otherwise treat personally identifiable information may change. We reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at our discretion. We will post any changes to this Policy or any new policy here and we encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. If there is any material change in the type of information we collect or the way in which we use such information, we will comply with any applicable laws with respect to notifying you of those changes, or where legally necessary, obtaining your consent to those changes.</p>
      	<h3>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
      	<p>When you supply Personal Information on this site, we will use it for the purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or loyalty program, or to fulfill the delivery of a sweepstakes prize or product order or to send you information regarding our products and promotions) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We also use Personal Information to keep track of a user's activities on our sites, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze web site usage, to improve our web site features, design and content and to refine our marketing strategies.</p>
      	<p>When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information as described in this Policy. For instance, you may choose not to receive communications from us.</p>
      	<p>The web site may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., the site might allow you to send an email or message to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and email address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to deliver the email message) and we will not contact the third party again by email unless you request us to, if they have an existing business relationship with us, or the third party contacts us.</p>
      	<p>We may also enhance your Personal Information by linking it to data obtained from third parties, such as non-personally identifiable information (e.g., demographic and geographic characteristics) as well as other publicly available data such as census information. Such enhanced information allows us to provide our users with a more customized experience.</p>
      	<p>Tropicana's primary goal in collecting and using Personal Information is to give you a meaningful and customized experience while you are using our web sites as well as to promote our products in a cost-effective and efficient manner. </p>
      	<h3>Collection and Use of Other Information; Use of Cookies</h3>
      	<p>You may have heard of “cookies,” which are small files or pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive when you visit a web site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most web sites. Tropicana may use cookies to collect other information during your visit to our web sites, such as the particular site areas you visit and the activities in which you participate at our web sites. Tropicana does not automatically collect any Personal Information, but we may combine non-personal information collected automatically (through cookies) with voluntarily submitted Personal Information. Such links may occur only if you provide Tropicana with Personal Information on our sites. This practice allows Tropicana to keep track of items such as sweepstakes participation, email and advertising interaction levels, survey responses, online coupon redemption and other web activity in order to better tailor our web sites and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our web sites - the computer can remember that you have already provided Personal Information to us and not request that you provide any a second time. </p>
      	<p>Anonymous information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet browser you are using, and the type of computer operating system you are using may also be collected by us using cookies. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from this web site, our servers log your IP address.</p>
      	<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Refusal of cookies at sites you enter may result in an inability to visit certain areas of the web sites or to receive personalized information when you visit the web sites.</p>
      	<h3>With Whom We May Share Information</h3>
      	<p>In the course of doing business, we employ other companies to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For example, at times we may retain third parties to analyze, update and correct data we collect on our web sites, including Personal Information, to help us improve our products, our database and our web sites. In addition, we may share Personal Information with agents, suppliers, fulfillment houses and other third parties to allow delivery of prizes, information, products or services. These suppliers and other third parties may have access to your Personal Information if it is needed to perform their functions for Tropicana, but they are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any way other than the intended use.</p>
      	<p>We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner the number of men and the number of women that entered a contest, but we do not disclose Personal Information about such contestants in violation of this Privacy Policy.</p>
      	<p>Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, transfer or disclose your Personal Information without your prior consent.</p>
      	<p>We may release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order, or to a third party to which ownership of Tropicana is transferred via an acquisition, merger, sale of assets or otherwise.</p>
      	<h3>Data Protection and Security</h3>
      	<p>We take commercially reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information secure. All access to the information we collect is subject to physical, electronic, and managerial restrictions to prevent unauthorized access, modification or misuse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
      	<h3>Collection of Personal Information from Children Under 13 Years Old</h3>
      	<p>Tropicana and the www.tropicana.com web site do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 on this site, do not direct this site to children under 13 and do not believe that our site is appealing to children in that age group. If you are a parent and believe your child has provided us with information please contact Maureen Meier at &nbsp;Maureen.Meier@tropicana.com.</p>
      	<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
      	<p>Users should be aware that when you are on this web site you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other web sites that include links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Tropicana family of brands or logos. These other web sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit Personal Information. Always be aware of where you are surfing on the Web. Check the linked site to locate and review its privacy policy, which may be different from this Privacy Policy. Tropicana does not endorse and makes no guarantee or representation as to the sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of the content or privacy policy of any third-party web site to which you may be linked from this site.</p>
      	<h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
      	<p>To opt out of receiving marketing email messages from us, you can <a href="/unsubscribe/">click this link</a>, follow the opt out instructions to any marketing email you receive from us, or you can send an opt out request to Maureen.Meier@tropicana.com.

      	<h3>Important Note Regarding U.S. Law Use of Materials on this Web Site</h3>
      	<p>Please note: The laws and regulations in different countries impose different (and even conflicting) requirements on the Internet and data protection. All matters relating to this site are governed by the laws of the State of Illinois in the USA. If you are located outside the USA, including in the European Economic Area, and you contact us, please note that any information you provide will be transferred to the USA and by submitting the information you authorize this transfer and understand that the information you provide will be protected as provided under U.S. law, not the law of your home country.</p>
