What Should Parents Know About Children?</strong></p><p>We understand the importance of protecting childrenâs privacy in the interactive world. We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children under the age of thirteen (13) (â<strong>Child</strong>â or â<strong>Children</strong>â) and do not knowingly collect personal information from Children on our Services that require parental notice and consent under the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (â<strong>COPPA</strong>â) without obtaining such parental consent.</p><p>Some of the features on our Service are âage-gatedâ so that they are not available for use by Children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from Children in connection with those features. When we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take additional steps to protect Childrenâs privacy, including:</p><ul><li>Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information.</li><li>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their Children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their Children.</li><li>Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.</li><li>If the Service is either directed to Children or we have actual knowledge that a user is a Child, the Child may be asked to provide his or her parentâs or guardianâs email address.</li><li>Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.</li></ul><p>In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any Child without first having obtained parental consent, we will dispose of that information in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations.
