<p>Welcome to Trouva's Privacy Policy, last updated on May 25, 2018</p>
<p><font size="5"><strong> What does this Privacy Policy Cover?</strong></font></p>
<p>Trouva respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your Personal Data. We want to be transparent with you about how we collect and use your Personal Data in making available this website (“Site”) and providing our services. </p>
<p>We want to make sure you know what happens to your Personal Data, what your rights are and how the law protects you. </p>
<p>With that in mind, this Privacy Policy is designed to describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who we are and how to contact us.</li>
<li>Your rights relating to your Personal Data.</li>
<li>Marketing communications preferences.</li>
<li>What Personal Data we collect.</li>
<li>How we use your Personal Data and why.</li>
<li>What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data?</li>
<li>Personal Data from Third Party Sources.</li>
<li>How we use cookies and other tracking or profiling technologies.</li>
<li>Who we share your Personal Data with. </li>
<li>How we keep your Personal Data secure.</li>
<li>How long we store your Personal Data.</li>
<li>Our policy on children.</li>
<li>Third party links.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Privacy Policy is intended to meet our duties of Transparency under the <strong> “General Data Protection Regulation” </strong> or <strong> “GDPR”</strong>.</p>
<p>We will post any modifications or changes to this Privacy Policy on this page, unless we specifically notify you otherwise. </p>
<p><font size="5"><strong> Who we are and how to contact us </strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Who we are.</strong></p>
<p>StreetHub Ltd, an English limited company trading under the name “Trouva”, is the Controller of your Personal Data (referred to in this Privacy Policy as either “<strong>Trouva</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”).</p>
<p>Our address is: 60 Worship Street, London, EC2A 2EZ, United Kingdom. </p>
<p><strong>How to contact us.</strong></p>
<p>You can contact us directly with any privacy-related queries or complaints by emailing: <strong>support@trouva.com.</strong> with the subject line "privacy/personal data request". </p>
<p><font size="5"><strong>Your rights relating to your Personal Data.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Your rights in connection with your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Request access to your Personal Data.</strong> This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you.</strong> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Request erasure of your Personal Data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below). </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Object to processing of your Personal Data.</strong> This right exists where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Request the transfer of your Personal Data.</strong>  We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to exercise your rights</strong></p>
<p>If you want to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us by emailing: <strong>support@trouva.com.</strong> with the subject line 'privacy/personal data request'. </p>
<p>Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights outlined above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may simply refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What do we need from you?</strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). </p>
<p>This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. </p>
<p>We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>How long do we typically take to resolve requests?</strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p><strong>Complaints</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to make a complaint regarding this Privacy Policy or our practices in relation to your Personal Data, please contact us at: <strong>support@trouva.com.</strong> with the subject line 'privacy/personal data request'.</p>
<p>We will reply to your complaint as soon as we can.</p>
<p>If you feel that your complaint has not been adequately resolved, please note that the GDPR gives you the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority, which for the UK, is the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
<p><font size="5"><strong>Marketing communications preferences.</strong></font><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><strong><strong>
<p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by:</p>
<p>following the “Unsubscribe” links on any marketing message sent to you (including emails relating to Boutiques you have chosen to ‘Follow’ on the Trouva platform); and/or 
•    contacting us at any time by emailing: <strong>support@trouva.com</strong> with the subject line "privacy/personal data request".</p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this opt-out will not apply to service-related communications (and any processing of your Personal Data involved in sending such communications). As a non-exhaustive list of what these service-related communications may include, they might be emails or notifications: </p>
<ul>
<li>about orders you make using the Trouva platform;</li>
<li>relating to the management of your account on the Site; </li>
<li>about your use of the Site; or</li>
<li>concerning updates to this Privacy Policy or our Terms &amp; Conditions etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="5"><strong>What Personal Data we collect. </strong></font></p>
<p>All the Personal Data we collect, both from you and from third parties about you, is outlined in the table below.</p>
<p>Before you read that table, it might be useful to explain what <strong>“Personal Data”</strong> is. The GDPR definition of Personal Data can be found here. Essentially, it means: information about an individual, from which that individual is either directly identified or can be identified.  </p>
<p>It does <strong>not</strong> include ‘anonymous data’ (i.e., information where the identity of individual has been permanently removed).</p>
<p>However, it <strong>does</strong> include ‘indirect identifiers’ or ‘pseudonymous data’ (i.e., information which alone doesn’t identify an individual but, when combined with certain additional and reasonably accessible information, could be attributed to a particular person).</p>

<p><strong>No Special Categories of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We do not collect any “<strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong>” about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.   </p>
<p><font size="5"><strong>How we use your Personal Data and why.</strong></font></p>
<p>We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. </p>
<p>If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p><strong>What is our “legal basis” for processing your Personal Data?</strong></p>
<p>In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a “legal basis” for that use. Most commonly, we will rely on one of the following legal bases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (“<strong>Contractual Necessity</strong>”).</p></li>
<li><p>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (“<strong>Legitimate Interests</strong>”). More detail about the specific legitimate interests pursued in respect of each Purpose we use your Personal Data for is set out in the table below.</p></li>
<li><p>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (“<strong>Compliance with Law</strong>”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have set out below, in a table format, the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant Purposes for which we use your Personal Data.</p>

For example, we may aggregate Technical Data and Behavioural Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Site feature.

<p><u>What are cookies?</u></p>
<p>We may collect information using “cookies”. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  </p>
<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device; and </p></li>
<li><p>third party cookies, which are served by our partners or service providers on our Site.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Cookies we use</u></p>
<p>Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below: </p>

    <td>Functionality Cookies</td>
    <td>These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Site. </td>

    <td>Analytics and Performance Cookies</td>
    <td><br>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.  We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on our Site, and improve the Site.<br>

<p><u>Disabling cookies</u></p>
<p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings”, “help” “tools” or “edit” facility).  Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.  </p>
<p>If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may not be able to recognise your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site. </p>
<p>Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.com.uk.</p>
<p>In particular, you can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.</p>
<p>You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here. </p>
<p><strong>Flash Technology</strong></p>
<p>We may use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object (“LSOs”)) on our Site to collect and store information about your use of our Site. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash cookies stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel at this website. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel at this website and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Site</p>
<p><strong>Pixel tags</strong></p>
<p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Signals</strong></p>
<p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not currently respond to do not track signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>

<p><strong>Data transfers</strong></p>
<p>We share your Personal Data with certain external third parties who are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>“Europe”</strong>). Any processing of your Personal Data by these parties will involve an export of your Personal Data outside of Europe.</p>
<p>We endeavour to ensure that people to whom we provide Personal Data hold it subject to appropriate safeguards and controls. Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of Europe, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>We may transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of Personal Data in non-EU countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Where we use service providers outside Europe, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Where we use service providers based in the U.S., we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Data shared between Europe and the U.S. For further details, see European Commission: EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="5"><strong>How we keep your Personal Data secure.</strong></font></p>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. The efficacy of these security measures is evidenced by the fact that we have attained the following certifications and accreditations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Attestation of PCI DSS compliance by an independent certified party</p></li>
<li><p>Cyber Essentials Scheme</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We limit access to your Personal Data to those employees and other staff who have a business need to have such access. All such people are subject to a contractual duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any actual or suspected Personal Data breach. In the event of any such breach, we have systems in place to work with applicable regulators. In addition, in certain circumstances (e.g., where we are legally required to do so) we may notify you of breaches affecting your Personal Data. </p>
<p><font size="5"><strong>How long we store your Personal Data.</strong></font></p>
<p>We are committed to only keeping your Personal Data for so long as we reasonably need to use it for the purposes set out above. This general rule applies unless a longer retention period is required by law (for example for regulatory purposes).</p>
<p>In respect of the Personal Data we process to provide you with the Trouva platform and associated services, we will only keep this Personal Data for so long as you have an open account on the Site. When you close your account, we will delete or irreversibly anonymise your Personal Data within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>As noted above:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in respect of any Personal Data we process based on our, or a third party’s, legitimate interests, you have the right to object to processing of your Personal Data for this purpose at any time; and</p></li>
<li><p>you also have a general right to request erasure of your Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to exercise either of these rights, please email us at: <strong>support@trouva.com.</strong> with the subject line "privacy/personal data request",</p>
<p>Please note that this data retention framework does not apply to Aggregated Data, which we may store for a longer period of time.</p>

All derivatives of the word “Order” (such as “Ordered”) should be understood in the context outlined in this definition. \n\n2.5\t“Products” means the Retailer’s goods, which it offers for sale via the Website from time to time.\n\n2.6\t“Retailer” means the independent boutique for whom Trouva: \n(a)\tmarkets, promotes and publishes Products through the Website; and \n(b)\taccepts and processes Orders from end-users of the Website for those Products, as described in these Terms and Conditions.\n\n2.7\t“Terms and Conditions” means the terms and conditions set out on this page, together with the Trouva policies explicitly referenced herein (e.g., Trouva’s Returns Policy).\n\n2.8\t“Website” means www.Trouva.com (including its subdomains) and any other associated applications or website owned and/or operated by Trouva from time to time.\n\n2.9\t“You” and “Your” means an end-user of the Website.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e3.\tInformation about Trouva and Our contact details \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n3.1\tWho We are. “Trouva” is the trading name of Streethub Ltd t/a Trouva, a company incorporated and registered in England with company number 8346380 and whose registered office is at 60 Worship Street, London, England, EC2A 2EZ,. In these Terms and Conditions, “We”, “Our” and “Us” are all references to Trouva – however, in the context of the Contract, You should read these terms as references to the relevant Retailer from whom you Ordered the Products (for more detail see Section 4 and specifically Section 4.5)  \n\n3.2\tHow to contact us. You can contact Trouva by writing to: support@trouva.com \n\n3.3\tHow We may contact You. If We have to contact You We may do so by email to the address You provided when You went through the checkout process on the Website or that is registered on Your Account from time to time. \n\n\u003cstrong\u003e4.\tHow does Trouva work? \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n4.1\tOrdering via the Website. We operate the Website as an electronic marketing platform, on which Listings may be posted by our selected Retailers for their Products. These Products are made available by those Retailers to You, and Trouva allows You to make Orders to pay for Products through the Website and either:\n(a)\tclick-and-collect the Product(s) from the relevant Retailer’s store; or\n(b)\thave the Product(s) delivered to the address You specify.\n\n4.2\tYour Contract is with the Retailer.  The Contract is between You and the relevant Retailer, not Trouva. You are buying the Products from the Retailer, not Trouva. However, We are authorised to act as the agent of Our Retailers (who act as principal) to conclude and enter into the Contract with You.  \n\n4.3\tTrouva’s role. We are not a party to the Contract. We are simply the intermediary marketing and promotions platform which facilitates Your making Orders with Retailers and Your payment for that Order.\n\n4.4\tWhen is the Contract formed? The Contract is formed when the relevant Retailer confirms to Us that it has the relevant Products in stock and we send you an Order confirmation email to that effect. We will send You that Order confirmation email to the email address associated with Your Account or, if You check-out as a ‘guest’, to the email address You entered during the checkout process).  \n\n4.5\tIncorporation of these Terms and Conditions. As noted above, in the context of any purchase of Products, Your Contract with the relevant Retailer incorporates, and is governed and conditioned by, these Terms and Conditions. This Contract is between You and the relevant Retailer, not Trouva. To the extent they are incorporated into the Contract, You should read references to “We”, “Our” and “Us” in these Terms and Conditions as references to the relevant Retailer from whom you Ordered the Products. \n\n4.6\tProducts may vary from their pictures. Trouva aims to use the Listings to give You the information You need to know the essential characteristics of the Products. Although We try to make sure they are as faithful as possible to the real thing, any images shown in the Listings are for illustrative purposes only – given the digital method of presentation it is possible that Your perception may not exactly match the relevant Product itself.\n\n4.7\tCompliance with UK Laws. In Our agreements with them, We require Retailers to ensure the Products they make available comply with applicable UK laws and regulations.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e5.\tPayment\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n5.1\tYou authorise Us to charge Your payment card account. By submitting an Order and providing Us Your payment card details at checkout, You authorise Trouva (acting by its payment processor) to charge the relevant account to take payment for Your Order on behalf of the relevant Retailer. Neither Trouva nor the relevant Retailer will be responsible for any losses you may suffer if the payment method You use to pay for an Order does not have sufficient funds to cover all costs of that Order.  \n\n\u003cstrong\u003e6.\tDelivery \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n6.1\tPrices in Listing exclude delivery charges. The prices shown on Listings for Products do not include delivery charges. Where You choose to have the Products delivered to You, the relevant delivery charges will be displayed to You during the checkout process.\n\n6.2\tDelivery estimates not binding. Where You choose to have them delivered, the Products You Order will be delivered by Retailers using a third party courier service. Please note that any estimated delivery dates displayed on the Website, or in any confirmation email or webpage, are simply estimates – they do not represent a guarantee that the Products will arrive by that delivery estimate. If You do not receive a delivery in time, You may cancel Your Order in accordance with the cancellation policy detailed below, as well as the practices described in Our Returns Policy.\n\n6.3\tOrders delivered outside the UK. If You Order Products for delivery to a location outside the UK, those Products may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You (and not Trouva, nor the relevant Retailer) will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that We have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact Your local customs office for further information before placing an Order for delivery to a location outside the UK.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e7.\tReturns \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n7.1\tReturns Policy. Our Returns Policy details how and when You can return any Products You have Ordered and is incorporated into these Terms and Conditions by reference.  We have set out Our policy on returns in this separate page to ensure that all necessary information is presented on a standalone page, in a clear and accessible form – however, the contents of this page do not affect any rights You may have at law (the key ones of which are outlined in Section 9). \n\n7.2\tNo commercial use. Orders which are used for commercial purposes and subsequently returned (e.g. for use as props for photography) are actively monitored. Trouva reserves the right to refuse to serve any person suspected of undertaking this activity for future orders.

If You do create an Account, all the registration information You submit should be truthful and accurate. If for any reason any information You submit is or becomes untruthful, inaccurate and/or incomplete, You should update that information to maintain its accuracy.\n\n8.3\tWhat to do if You want to delete Your Account.

Accordingly, You are responsible for all activities that occur under Your Account.  \n\n8.5\tUnauthorised use of Your Account.

As You are purchasing the Products online You have a legal right to change Your mind within fourteen (14) days from delivery of the Products and receive a refund (including costs of delivery, but excluding the costs of return) – however, please note that these cancellation rights do not apply to:\n(a)\tto any Products that are sealed (this includes any items such as underwear, which come with a hygiene strip) and that are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons if they become unsealed, which become unsealed after delivery;\n(b)\tto any Products that are sealed audio recordings, video recordings or computer software, which become unsealed after delivery;\n(c)\tif the Products have become inseparably mixed with other items after delivery.\n\n9.2\tReturning faulty Products.

The Terms and Conditions (as incorporated into the Contract) that will apply to Your purchase of any Products will be those that are in force at the time You place Your Order, unless We have notified You of a change to the Terms and Conditions that apply and will materially affect Your Order before We send You the delivery confirmation and You have confirmed that You wish to proceed with Your Order.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e11.\tPrivacy and security policy \u003c/strong\u003e\n\nOur policies and procedures relating to Our use of Your ‘personal data’ are outlined in Our Privacy Policy.

We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not a foreseeable result of Our breaching these Terms and Conditions or failing to act with reasonable care and skill. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable.

Although the Contract is between You and the relevant Retailer (as described in Section 4.2), all other aspects of the agreement formed under these Terms and Conditions are between You and Trouva and no other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its Terms and Conditions.\n\n16.3\tHeadings and Interpretation. The section titles in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”.  \n\n16.4\tEven if We delay enforcing Our rights under these Terms and Conditions, We can still enforce them later. If We do not insist immediately that You do anything You are required to do under these Terms and Conditions, or if We delay in taking steps against You in respect of Your breaking these Terms and Conditions, that will not mean that You do not have to do those things and it will not prevent Us taking steps against You at a later date. \n\n16.5\tIf a court finds part of these Terms and Conditions illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the sections of these Terms and Conditions operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining sections will remain in full force and effect.\n\n16.6\tTrouva may transfer its rights under these Terms and Conditions to someone else. Trouva may transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms and Conditions to another organisation – for example, this could include another member of Trouva’s group of companies or someone who buys its business. Trouva will take reasonable steps to ensure that any such transfer does not affect Your rights under these Terms and Conditions.\n\n16.7\tPersonal agreement. The agreement formed under Terms and Conditions, and each Contract, is personal to You and You cannot transfer any of Your rights under them to any other person without Our prior express written consent. \n\n16.8\tEmail counts as “in writing”. When We use the words “writing” or “written” in these Terms, this includes emails.

All of these categories of data subjects need to be notified of their rights and the procedures for exercising them.  \n\nThe form in which these procedures are made accessible to data subjects may vary, depending on the category of data subject.  The procedures below are drafted for internal use to inform those who will be responding to data subjects’ requests of data subjects’ rights.  However, they can easily be modified for external use, e.g., to notify data subjects of their rights.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e1.\tAbout these procedures\u003c/strong\u003e \n\n1.1.\tData subjects have certain rights under the GDPR in respect of their personal data.  When we process data subjects’ personal data, we shall respect those rights. These procedures provide a framework for responding to requests to exercise those rights.  It is our policy to ensure that requests by data subjects covered by these procedures to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data are handled in accordance with the GDPR.\n\n1.2.\tFor the purposes of these procedures, \u003cstrong\u003e“personal data”\u003c/strong\u003e means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (\u003cstrong\u003e“data subject”\u003c/strong\u003e).  An identified or identifiable individual is anyone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, identification number, location data or online identifier, or by reference to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.  \u003cstrong\u003e“Processing”\u003c/strong\u003e means any operation or set of operations that is performed on personal data or sets of personal data, such as collection, use, storage, dissemination and erasure.\n\n1.3.\tThese procedures only apply to data subjects whose personal data we process.\n\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e2.\tResponding to requests to access personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n2.1.\tData subjects have the right to request access to their personal data processed by us.  Such requests are called subject access requests (\u003cstrong\u003e“SARs”\u003c/strong\u003e).  When a data subject makes a SAR we shall take the following steps:\n\n2.1.1.\tlog the date on which the request was received (to ensure that the relevant timeframe of one month for responding to the request is met);\n\n2.1.2.\tconfirm the identity of the data subject who is the subject of the personal data.  For example, we may request additional information from the data subject to confirm their identity;\n\n2.1.3.\tsearch databases, systems, applications and other places where the personal data which are the subject of the request may be held; and\n\n2.1.4.\tconfirm to the data subject whether or not personal data of the data subject making the SAR are being processed.\n\n2.2.\tIf personal data of the data subject are being processed, we shall provide the data subject with the following information in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in writing or by other (including electronic) means:\n\n2.2.1.\tthe purposes of the processing;\n\n2.2.2.\tthe categories of personal data concerned (e.g., contact details, bank account information and details of sales activity);\n\n2.2.3.\tthe recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients overseas (e.g., service providers based outside the European Economic Area (being the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (\u003cstrong\u003e“EEA”\u003c/strong\u003e));\n\n2.2.4.\twhere possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n\n2.2.5.\tthe existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing;\n\n2.2.6.\tthe right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office;\n\n2.2.7.\twhere the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; \n\n2.2.8.\tthe existence of automated decision-making and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject; and\n\n2.2.9.\twhere personal data are transferred outside the EEA, details of the appropriate safeguards to protect the personal data.\n\n2.3.\tWe shall also, unless there is an exemption (see Exemptions below), provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data processed by us in a commonly used electronic form (unless the data subject either did not make the request by electronic means or has specifically requested not to be provided with the copy in electronic form) within one month of receipt of the request.  If the request is complex, or there are a number of requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months.  If we extend the period for responding we shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay.\n\n2.4.\tBefore providing the personal data to the data subject making the SAR, we shall review the personal data requested to see if they contain the personal data of other data subjects.  If they do, we may redact the personal data of those other data subjects prior to providing the data subject with their personal data, unless those other data subjects have consented to the disclosure of their personal data.\n\n2.5.\tIf the SAR is manifestly unfounded or excessive, e.g., because of its repetitive character, we may charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the personal data, or refuse to act on the request.\n\n2.6.\tIf we are not going to respond to the SAR we shall inform the data subject of the reason(s) for not taking action and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e3.\tResponding to requests to rectify personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n3.1.\tData subjects have the right to have their inaccurate personal data rectified.  Rectification can include having incomplete personal data completed, e.g., by a data subject providing a supplementary statement regarding the data.  Where such a request is made, we shall, unless there is an exemption (see Exemptions below), rectify the personal data without undue delay.  \n\n3.2.\tWe shall also communicate the rectification of the personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed (e.g., our third party service providers who process the data on our behalf), unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.  We shall also inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e4.\tResponding to requests for the erasure of personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n4.1.\tData subjects have the right, in certain circumstances, to request that we erase their personal data.

We may request additional information from the data subject to do this;\n\n4.2.3.\tsearch databases, systems, applications and other places where the personal data which are the subject of the request may be held and erase such data within one month of receipt of the request.

Although the Contract is between You and the relevant Retailer (as described in Section 4.2), all other aspects of the agreement formed under these Terms and Conditions are between You and Trouva and no other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its Terms and Conditions.\n\n16.3\tHeadings and Interpretation. The section titles in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”.  \n\n16.4\tEven if We delay enforcing Our rights under these Terms and Conditions, We can still enforce them later. If We do not insist immediately that You do anything You are required to do under these Terms and Conditions, or if We delay in taking steps against You in respect of Your breaking these Terms and Conditions, that will not mean that You do not have to do those things and it will not prevent Us taking steps against You at a later date. \n\n16.5\tIf a court finds part of these Terms and Conditions illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the sections of these Terms and Conditions operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining sections will remain in full force and effect.\n\n16.6\tTrouva may transfer its rights under these Terms and Conditions to someone else. Trouva may transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms and Conditions to another organisation – for example, this could include another member of Trouva’s group of companies or someone who buys its business. Trouva will take reasonable steps to ensure that any such transfer does not affect Your rights under these Terms and Conditions.\n\n16.7\tPersonal agreement. The agreement formed under Terms and Conditions, and each Contract, is personal to You and You cannot transfer any of Your rights under them to any other person without Our prior express written consent. \n\n16.8\tEmail counts as “in writing”. When We use the words “writing” or “written” in these Terms, this includes emails.

All of these categories of data subjects need to be notified of their rights and the procedures for exercising them.  \n\nThe form in which these procedures are made accessible to data subjects may vary, depending on the category of data subject.  The procedures below are drafted for internal use to inform those who will be responding to data subjects’ requests of data subjects’ rights.  However, they can easily be modified for external use, e.g., to notify data subjects of their rights.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e1.\tAbout these procedures\u003c/strong\u003e \n\n1.1.\tData subjects have certain rights under the GDPR in respect of their personal data.  When we process data subjects’ personal data, we shall respect those rights. These procedures provide a framework for responding to requests to exercise those rights.  It is our policy to ensure that requests by data subjects covered by these procedures to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data are handled in accordance with the GDPR.\n\n1.2.\tFor the purposes of these procedures, \u003cstrong\u003e“personal data”\u003c/strong\u003e means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (\u003cstrong\u003e“data subject”\u003c/strong\u003e).  An identified or identifiable individual is anyone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, identification number, location data or online identifier, or by reference to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.  \u003cstrong\u003e“Processing”\u003c/strong\u003e means any operation or set of operations that is performed on personal data or sets of personal data, such as collection, use, storage, dissemination and erasure.\n\n1.3.\tThese procedures only apply to data subjects whose personal data we process.\n\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e2.\tResponding to requests to access personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n2.1.\tData subjects have the right to request access to their personal data processed by us.  Such requests are called subject access requests (\u003cstrong\u003e“SARs”\u003c/strong\u003e).  When a data subject makes a SAR we shall take the following steps:\n\n2.1.1.\tlog the date on which the request was received (to ensure that the relevant timeframe of one month for responding to the request is met);\n\n2.1.2.\tconfirm the identity of the data subject who is the subject of the personal data.  For example, we may request additional information from the data subject to confirm their identity;\n\n2.1.3.\tsearch databases, systems, applications and other places where the personal data which are the subject of the request may be held; and\n\n2.1.4.\tconfirm to the data subject whether or not personal data of the data subject making the SAR are being processed.\n\n2.2.\tIf personal data of the data subject are being processed, we shall provide the data subject with the following information in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in writing or by other (including electronic) means:\n\n2.2.1.\tthe purposes of the processing;\n\n2.2.2.\tthe categories of personal data concerned (e.g., contact details, bank account information and details of sales activity);\n\n2.2.3.\tthe recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients overseas (e.g., service providers based outside the European Economic Area (being the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (\u003cstrong\u003e“EEA”\u003c/strong\u003e));\n\n2.2.4.\twhere possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n\n2.2.5.\tthe existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing;\n\n2.2.6.\tthe right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office;\n\n2.2.7.\twhere the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; \n\n2.2.8.\tthe existence of automated decision-making and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject; and\n\n2.2.9.\twhere personal data are transferred outside the EEA, details of the appropriate safeguards to protect the personal data.\n\n2.3.\tWe shall also, unless there is an exemption (see Exemptions below), provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data processed by us in a commonly used electronic form (unless the data subject either did not make the request by electronic means or has specifically requested not to be provided with the copy in electronic form) within one month of receipt of the request.  If the request is complex, or there are a number of requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months.  If we extend the period for responding we shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay.\n\n2.4.\tBefore providing the personal data to the data subject making the SAR, we shall review the personal data requested to see if they contain the personal data of other data subjects.  If they do, we may redact the personal data of those other data subjects prior to providing the data subject with their personal data, unless those other data subjects have consented to the disclosure of their personal data.\n\n2.5.\tIf the SAR is manifestly unfounded or excessive, e.g., because of its repetitive character, we may charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the personal data, or refuse to act on the request.\n\n2.6.\tIf we are not going to respond to the SAR we shall inform the data subject of the reason(s) for not taking action and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e3.\tResponding to requests to rectify personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n3.1.\tData subjects have the right to have their inaccurate personal data rectified.  Rectification can include having incomplete personal data completed, e.g., by a data subject providing a supplementary statement regarding the data.  Where such a request is made, we shall, unless there is an exemption (see Exemptions below), rectify the personal data without undue delay.  \n\n3.2.\tWe shall also communicate the rectification of the personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed (e.g., our third party service providers who process the data on our behalf), unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

If we extend the period for responding we shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay;\n\n4.2.4.\twhere we have made the personal data public, we must, taking reasonable steps, including technical measures, inform those who are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by them of any links to, or copies or replications of, those personal data; and\n\n4.2.5.\tcommunicate the erasure of the personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

In these Terms and Conditions, “We”, “Our” and “Us” are all references to Trouva – however, in the context of the Contract, You should read these terms as references to the relevant Retailer from whom you Ordered the Products (for more detail see Section 4 and specifically Section 4.5)  \n\n3.2\tHow to contact us. You can contact Trouva by writing to: support@trouva.com \n\n3.3\tHow We may contact You. If We have to contact You We may do so by email to the address You provided when You went through the checkout process on the Website or that is registered on Your Account from time to time. \n\n\u003cstrong\u003e4.\tHow does Trouva work? \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n4.1\tOrdering via the Website. We operate the Website as an electronic marketing platform, on which Listings may be posted by our selected Retailers for their Products. These Products are made available by those Retailers to You, and Trouva allows You to make Orders to pay for Products through the Website and either:\n(a)\tclick-and-collect the Product(s) from the relevant Retailer’s store; or\n(b)\thave the Product(s) delivered to the address You specify.\n\n4.2\tYour Contract is with the Retailer.  The Contract is between You and the relevant Retailer, not Trouva. You are buying the Products from the Retailer, not Trouva. However, We are authorised to act as the agent of Our Retailers (who act as principal) to conclude and enter into the Contract with You.  \n\n4.3\tTrouva’s role. We are not a party to the Contract. We are simply the intermediary marketing and promotions platform which facilitates Your making Orders with Retailers and Your payment for that Order.\n\n4.4\tWhen is the Contract formed? The Contract is formed when the relevant Retailer confirms to Us that it has the relevant Products in stock and we send you an Order confirmation email to that effect. We will send You that Order confirmation email to the email address associated with Your Account or, if You check-out as a ‘guest’, to the email address You entered during the checkout process).  \n\n4.5\tIncorporation of these Terms and Conditions. As noted above, in the context of any purchase of Products, Your Contract with the relevant Retailer incorporates, and is governed and conditioned by, these Terms and Conditions. This Contract is between You and the relevant Retailer, not Trouva. To the extent they are incorporated into the Contract, You should read references to “We”, “Our” and “Us” in these Terms and Conditions as references to the relevant Retailer from whom you Ordered the Products. \n\n4.6\tProducts may vary from their pictures. Trouva aims to use the Listings to give You the information You need to know the essential characteristics of the Products. Although We try to make sure they are as faithful as possible to the real thing, any images shown in the Listings are for illustrative purposes only – given the digital method of presentation it is possible that Your perception may not exactly match the relevant Product itself.\n\n4.7\tCompliance with UK Laws. In Our agreements with them, We require Retailers to ensure the Products they make available comply with applicable UK laws and regulations.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e5.\tPayment\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n5.1\tYou authorise Us to charge Your payment card account. By submitting an Order and providing Us Your payment card details at checkout, You authorise Trouva (acting by its payment processor) to charge the relevant account to take payment for Your Order on behalf of the relevant Retailer. Neither Trouva nor the relevant Retailer will be responsible for any losses you may suffer if the payment method You use to pay for an Order does not have sufficient funds to cover all costs of that Order.  \n\n\u003cstrong\u003e6.\tDelivery \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n6.1\tPrices in Listing exclude delivery charges. The prices shown on Listings for Products do not include delivery charges. Where You choose to have the Products delivered to You, the relevant delivery charges will be displayed to You during the checkout process.\n\n6.2\tDelivery estimates not binding. Where You choose to have them delivered, the Products You Order will be delivered by Retailers using a third party courier service. Please note that any estimated delivery dates displayed on the Website, or in any confirmation email or webpage, are simply estimates – they do not represent a guarantee that the Products will arrive by that delivery estimate. If You do not receive a delivery in time, You may cancel Your Order in accordance with the cancellation policy detailed below, as well as the practices described in Our Returns Policy.\n\n6.3\tOrders delivered outside the UK. If You Order Products for delivery to a location outside the UK, those Products may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You (and not Trouva, nor the relevant Retailer) will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that We have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact Your local customs office for further information before placing an Order for delivery to a location outside the UK.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e7.\tReturns \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n7.1\tReturns Policy. Our Returns Policy details how and when You can return any Products You have Ordered and is incorporated into these Terms and Conditions by reference.  We have set out Our policy on returns in this separate page to ensure that all necessary information is presented on a standalone page, in a clear and accessible form – however, the contents of this page do not affect any rights You may have at law (the key ones of which are outlined in Section 9). \n\n7.2\tNo commercial use. Orders which are used for commercial purposes and subsequently returned (e.g. for use as props for photography) are actively monitored. Trouva reserves the right to refuse to serve any person suspected of undertaking this activity for future orders. If You require Products for commercial purposes, please get in touch at press@trouva.com for more information.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e8.\tAccounts \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n8.1\tAccount creation.  Although You can go through the order process as a guest, You may choose to register for an Account. In which case You will have to provide certain information about Yourself as prompted during the account registration process on the Website.  \n\n8.2\tAccurate and up-to-date information. If You do create an Account, all the registration information You submit should be truthful and accurate. If for any reason any information You submit is or becomes untruthful, inaccurate and/or incomplete, You should update that information to maintain its accuracy.\n\n8.3\tWhat to do if You want to delete Your Account.  You can delete Your Account at any time, for any reason, by following the Account deletion instructions within the Privacy Policy on the Website.  \n\n8.4\tYou are responsible for Your Account.

Accordingly, You are responsible for all activities that occur under Your Account.  \n\n8.5\tUnauthorised use of Your Account. You should notify Us immediately if You suspect or become aware of any unauthorised use of Your Account or any other breach of its security.  \n\n\u003cstrong\u003e9.\tSummary of Your key legal rights \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n9.1\tCancelling because You’ve changed Your mind. As You are purchasing the Products online You have a legal right to change Your mind within fourteen (14) days from delivery of the Products and receive a refund (including costs of delivery, but excluding the costs of return) – however, please note that these cancellation rights do not apply to:\n(a)\tto any Products that are sealed (this includes any items such as underwear, which come with a hygiene strip) and that are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons if they become unsealed, which become unsealed after delivery;\n(b)\tto any Products that are sealed audio recordings, video recordings or computer software, which become unsealed after delivery;\n(c)\tif the Products have become inseparably mixed with other items after delivery.\n\n9.2\tReturning faulty Products.

If We do so, We will:\n(a)\tpost those changes in an updated version of these Terms and Conditions on the Website; and  \n\n10.2\tWhich Terms and Conditions apply? The Terms and Conditions (as incorporated into the Contract) that will apply to Your purchase of any Products will be those that are in force at the time You place Your Order, unless We have notified You of a change to the Terms and Conditions that apply and will materially affect Your Order before We send You the delivery confirmation and You have confirmed that You wish to proceed with Your Order.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e11.\tPrivacy and security policy \u003c/strong\u003e\n\nOur policies and procedures relating to Our use of Your ‘personal data’ are outlined in Our Privacy Policy.

If We fail to comply with these Terms and Conditions, We are only responsible for loss or damage You suffer that is a foreseeable result of Our breaching these Terms and Conditions or failing to act with reasonable care and skill. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not a foreseeable result of Our breaching these Terms and Conditions or failing to act with reasonable care and skill. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is either obvious that it will happen or if, at the time these Terms and Conditions are entered into, both We and You knew it might happen.\n\n15.2\tWhat We do not exclude. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall limit or exclude Our liability for:\n\n(a)\tdeath or personal injury resulting from Our negligence;\n\n(b)\tfraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;\n\n(c)\tYour key legal rights described in Sections 9.1 and 9.2; \n\n(d)\tany other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by English law.\n\n15.3\tWe are not liable for business losses.

We will use Our reasonable endeavours to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which Our obligations under the Terms and Conditions may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.\n\n15.5\tWe are not liable for Product unavailability.

Although the Contract is between You and the relevant Retailer (as described in Section 4.2), all other aspects of the agreement formed under these Terms and Conditions are between You and Trouva and no other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its Terms and Conditions.\n\n16.3\tHeadings and Interpretation. The section titles in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”.  \n\n16.4\tEven if We delay enforcing Our rights under these Terms and Conditions, We can still enforce them later. If We do not insist immediately that You do anything You are required to do under these Terms and Conditions, or if We delay in taking steps against You in respect of Your breaking these Terms and Conditions, that will not mean that You do not have to do those things and it will not prevent Us taking steps against You at a later date. \n\n16.5\tIf a court finds part of these Terms and Conditions illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the sections of these Terms and Conditions operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining sections will remain in full force and effect.\n\n16.6\tTrouva may transfer its rights under these Terms and Conditions to someone else. Trouva may transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms and Conditions to another organisation – for example, this could include another member of Trouva’s group of companies or someone who buys its business. Trouva will take reasonable steps to ensure that any such transfer does not affect Your rights under these Terms and Conditions.\n\n16.7\tPersonal agreement. The agreement formed under Terms and Conditions, and each Contract, is personal to You and You cannot transfer any of Your rights under them to any other person without Our prior express written consent. \n\n16.8\tEmail counts as “in writing”. When We use the words “writing” or “written” in these Terms, this includes emails.

That way we create the trust and rapport that are the foundation of community.\n\nWe’re a talented bunch but we’re not telepathic. Talking to each other helps us understand where priorities lie, what to work on, how to help and why we’re doing it.\n\nBut broadcasting is not enough. When we have something to share, we ask ourselves who need to know what and then ensure they’ve received and understood.\n\n* * *\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eChallenge yourself and each other\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe believe that the status quo is never set in stone. We like to challenge the norm and relish being challenged. We thrive on innovation whilst taking advantage of what has gone before. We don’t seek change for change’s sake and use others’ learnings to help us reach the next level. \n\nIn order to reach the best outcomes, we want people to be open. To speak up if they disagree with something or observe an opportunity to improve. To request critical feedback. To suggest solutions that help individuals and the company grow.\n\n* * *\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eMake somebody's day better\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe work hard and inspire the best in each other by setting a good example and being supportive. \n\nIt’s easy to forget to do if we’re busy or tired. So we’re committed every day to making one person’s day better by sprinkling a little magic on proceedings.\n\nWe go out of our way to bring joy to customers and colleagues. It’s as simple as a cup of tea, an understanding ear, or recognition of a job well done.\n\nWe’re mindful of those around us and respect our communal work environment. Remembering always to treat others as we wish to be treated.\n\n\n","slug":"our-values"},{"name":"Careers","id":"careers","content":"## Careers\n\nThe best products from your favourite boutiques delivered with efficiency and an amazing experience.

All of these categories of data subjects need to be notified of their rights and the procedures for exercising them.  \n\nThe form in which these procedures are made accessible to data subjects may vary, depending on the category of data subject.  The procedures below are drafted for internal use to inform those who will be responding to data subjects’ requests of data subjects’ rights.  However, they can easily be modified for external use, e.g., to notify data subjects of their rights.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e1.\tAbout these procedures\u003c/strong\u003e \n\n1.1.\tData subjects have certain rights under the GDPR in respect of their personal data.  When we process data subjects’ personal data, we shall respect those rights. These procedures provide a framework for responding to requests to exercise those rights.  It is our policy to ensure that requests by data subjects covered by these procedures to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data are handled in accordance with the GDPR.\n\n1.2.\tFor the purposes of these procedures, \u003cstrong\u003e“personal data”\u003c/strong\u003e means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (\u003cstrong\u003e“data subject”\u003c/strong\u003e).  An identified or identifiable individual is anyone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, identification number, location data or online identifier, or by reference to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.  \u003cstrong\u003e“Processing”\u003c/strong\u003e means any operation or set of operations that is performed on personal data or sets of personal data, such as collection, use, storage, dissemination and erasure.\n\n1.3.\tThese procedures only apply to data subjects whose personal data we process.\n\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e2.\tResponding to requests to access personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n2.1.\tData subjects have the right to request access to their personal data processed by us.  Such requests are called subject access requests (\u003cstrong\u003e“SARs”\u003c/strong\u003e).  When a data subject makes a SAR we shall take the following steps:\n\n2.1.1.\tlog the date on which the request was received (to ensure that the relevant timeframe of one month for responding to the request is met);\n\n2.1.2.\tconfirm the identity of the data subject who is the subject of the personal data.  For example, we may request additional information from the data subject to confirm their identity;\n\n2.1.3.\tsearch databases, systems, applications and other places where the personal data which are the subject of the request may be held; and\n\n2.1.4.\tconfirm to the data subject whether or not personal data of the data subject making the SAR are being processed.\n\n2.2.\tIf personal data of the data subject are being processed, we shall provide the data subject with the following information in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in writing or by other (including electronic) means:\n\n2.2.1.\tthe purposes of the processing;\n\n2.2.2.\tthe categories of personal data concerned (e.g., contact details, bank account information and details of sales activity);\n\n2.2.3.\tthe recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients overseas (e.g., service providers based outside the European Economic Area (being the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (\u003cstrong\u003e“EEA”\u003c/strong\u003e));\n\n2.2.4.\twhere possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n\n2.2.5.\tthe existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing;\n\n2.2.6.\tthe right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office;\n\n2.2.7.\twhere the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; \n\n2.2.8.\tthe existence of automated decision-making and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject; and\n\n2.2.9.\twhere personal data are transferred outside the EEA, details of the appropriate safeguards to protect the personal data.\n\n2.3.\tWe shall also, unless there is an exemption (see Exemptions below), provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data processed by us in a commonly used electronic form (unless the data subject either did not make the request by electronic means or has specifically requested not to be provided with the copy in electronic form) within one month of receipt of the request.  If the request is complex, or there are a number of requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months.  If we extend the period for responding we shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay.\n\n2.4.\tBefore providing the personal data to the data subject making the SAR, we shall review the personal data requested to see if they contain the personal data of other data subjects.  If they do, we may redact the personal data of those other data subjects prior to providing the data subject with their personal data, unless those other data subjects have consented to the disclosure of their personal data.\n\n2.5.\tIf the SAR is manifestly unfounded or excessive, e.g., because of its repetitive character, we may charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the personal data, or refuse to act on the request.\n\n2.6.\tIf we are not going to respond to the SAR we shall inform the data subject of the reason(s) for not taking action and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e3.\tResponding to requests to rectify personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n3.1.\tData subjects have the right to have their inaccurate personal data rectified.  Rectification can include having incomplete personal data completed, e.g., by a data subject providing a supplementary statement regarding the data.  Where such a request is made, we shall, unless there is an exemption (see Exemptions below), rectify the personal data without undue delay.  \n\n3.2.\tWe shall also communicate the rectification of the personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed (e.g., our third party service providers who process the data on our behalf), unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

If the request is complex, or there are a number of requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months.  If we extend the period for responding we shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay;\n\n4.2.4.\twhere we have made the personal data public, we must, taking reasonable steps, including technical measures, inform those who are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by them of any links to, or copies or replications of, those personal data; and\n\n4.2.5.\tcommunicate the erasure of the personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

If the request is complex, or there are a number of requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months.  If we extend the period for responding we shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay.\n\n6.3.\tIf the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, e.g., because of its repetitive character, we may charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing or transmitting the personal data or refuse to act on the request.\n\n6.4.\tIf we are not going to respond to the request we shall inform the data subject of the reasons for not taking action and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with the Information Commissioner�����s Office.\n  \n\u003cstrong\u003e7.\tResponding to objections to the processing of personal data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n7.1.\tData subjects have the right to object to the processing of their personal data where such processing is on the basis of our performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us, or on the basis of our legitimate interests which override the data subject’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, unless we either:\n\n7.1.1.\tcan show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override those interests, rights and freedoms; or\n\n7.1.2.\tare processing the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\n7.2.\tData subjects also have the right to object to the processing of their personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\n\n7.3.\tWhere such an objection is made, we shall, unless there is an exemption (see Exemptions below), no longer process a data subject’s personal data.\n\n7.4.\tWhere personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, data subjects have the right to object at any time to the processing of their personal data for such marketing.
