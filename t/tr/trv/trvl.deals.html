<br>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MediaAlpha</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, privacy is a top priority, and we are committed to protecting the personal information of our customers. This Privacy Policy provides details on how we treat any personal information you may submit to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy applies to this website, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trvl.deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the “Site”), which is made available by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuoteLab, LLC, which does business as MediaAlpha ("</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or “us”). Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site and not to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.</span></p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect and Use</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will collect and use personal information about you to respond to your request for products and services offered through the Site. Specifically, we collect information provided by you in connection with providing price quotes for travel related products and services. We may also collect your email address if you wish to sign up for our newsletter or deal alerts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also collect demographic information. Demographic information is all other information such as gender, zip code, or any information that is not tied to your personal information. In addition, we might receive information about you from other online or offline sources and may add that information to your existing account.</span></p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share personal information about you under the following circumstances:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price Quote Requests. If you submit a request on the Site for price quotes for travel related products or services, we will use the information contained in your request form (such as dates of travel and destinations) with third parties, which include carriers, hotels, travel agents and other providers (“Service Providers”) in our network to provide relevant information. In some circumstances, we may obtain additional information about you and/or share that information with Service Providers in our network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Service Providers in our network have entered into agreements with us which require them to secure any personal information provided through the Site and limit how they can use such information. These Service Providers are also required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations. By submitting your request to us, you understand that Service Providers. If one of the Service Providers contacts you and you wish not to be contacted again by that Service Provider with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that Service Provider. Please note that the Service Providers may maintain the information you provide to them whether or not you elect to use their services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregate, Non-Personal, or De-identified Information. We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal, de-identified, or anonymous information we collect with third parties, including our affiliates, to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Site and on the websites of third parties and our affiliates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Required by Law. We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances whenever we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Transfer. As with any other business, it is possible that we could in the future enter into a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale. If such a transaction occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including your personal information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless you consent otherwise as provided herein.</span></p>
<p><strong>Information Collection Technologies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better serve our users and Service Providers and enhance the response time of the Site, we use various technologies to collect information about our users, such as:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Website to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used the Site. Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's websites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners. We also may use cookies to deliver targeted advertising (or allow third parties to deliver targeted advertising) on our website and the websites of our affiliates and third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please visit </span><a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find additional information and options to remove or disable cookies, and to opt out of certain targeted advertisements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log Files.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear Gifs.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site and in our HTML emails by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Emails</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By providing your contact information to us through the Site, you are registering to receive communications from us directly, on our website or through a third party. We will periodically send you newsletters and other e-mails with offers and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive these communications, please let us know by sending an email to Customer Care at info@trvl.deals You may also opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link in our emails.</span></p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that we can only control our own mailing list and policies. Third party advertisers that maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that advertise our services. In addition, if you provide your personal information to a Service Provider in our network, any use of your information by that Service Provider will be subject to their privacy policies and procedures. You would need to contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their email communications.</span></p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we limit access to personal information to those employees or agents who assist us in providing requested products and services to you and maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard personal information about you.</span></p>
<p><strong>Third Party Links</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide on the Site. However, when you visit websites to which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trvl.deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> links, keep in mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policy. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policy. A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be at least 14 years old to use this website. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information about visitors under 14 years of age.

However, you should check this Privacy Policy each time you use the Site to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices.
