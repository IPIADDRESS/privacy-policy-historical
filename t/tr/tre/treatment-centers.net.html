	  <b>Understanding Your Health Record/Information:</b><br>
	  Each time you visit a health care facility, physician, or other healthcare 
	  provider, a record of your visit is made. Typically, this record contains 
	  information about your health history, symptoms, examination and test results, 
	  diagnoses, treatment, and a plan for future care or treatment. This information, 
	  often referred to as your client/patient or medical record, serves as a:

		<li>Basis for planning your care and treatment.</li>
		<li>Means of communication among the health professionals who contribute 
		  to your care.</li>
		<li>Legal document describing the care you received.</li>

		  billed were actually provided.</li>
		<li>Tool in educating heath professionals.</li>

		<li>Basis of de-identified information for public health officials charged 
		  with improving the health of the local region or the nation.</li>

	  <ul>
		<li>Insure its accuracy.</li>
		<li>Better understand who, what, when, where and why others may access 
		  your health information, especially in the event that you did not sign 
		  a specified authorization to do so.</li>
		<li>Make more informed decisions when authorizing disclosure to others.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <b>Your Health Information Rights:</b><br>
	  Although your health record is the physical property of the healthcare practitioner 
	  or facility that compiled it, the information belongs to you. You have the 
	  right to:

		  as provided by 45 CFR 164.522 and 42 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 2.</li>
		<li>Obtain a paper copy of the notice of information practices upon request.</li>
		<li>Inspect and copy your health record as provided for in 45 CFR 164.524.</li>
		<li>Amend your health record as provided in 45 CFR 164.528.</li>
		<li>Obtain an accounting of disclosures of your health information as 
		  provided in 45 CFR 164.528.</li>
		<li>Request communications of your health information by alternative means 
		  or at alternative locations.</li>

		  to the extent that action has already been taken based on a previous 
		  authorization.</li>

	  <b>Our Responsibilities:</b><br>
	  This organization is required to: 
	  <ul>
		<li>Maintain the privacy of your health information.</li>
		<li>Provide you with a notice as to our legal duties and privacy practices 
		  with respect to information we collect and maintain about you.</li>
