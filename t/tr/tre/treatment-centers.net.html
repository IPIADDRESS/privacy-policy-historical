No employee or anyone affiliated with Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program will, or can be held responsible for knowing what a client's insurance will or will not cover. This includes benefits that may have been quoted by the insurance company.
<p>The business office will bill your insurance as a courtesy to you and make every effort to obtain payment. However, all or any portion of the bill that is not paid by the insurance carrier is the sole responsibility of the client and/or the guarantor. Benefits that are quoted by the insurance company may only reflect coverage charges and not 100% of the billed charges. Benefit quotations are subject to the member's eligibility at the time benefits were requested and any quotations are not a guarantee of benefit coverage or of member eligibility until actual insurance payment for services is received. All anticipated uninsured/non-covered charges and projected co-payments are expected to be paid upon admission. No interest will accrue to current accounts. Any and all unpaid portions of an account may be referred to a collection agency at thirty (30) days past due. If referred to collections, all interest and legal fees will be the responsibility of the debtor/guarantor.</p>

<td class="text">The confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records maintained by this program is protected by federal law and regulations (per 42 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 2). Generally, the program may not say to a person outside the program that a patient attends the program, or disclose any information identifying a patient as an alcohol or drug abuser unless:             <ol>
<li>The patient consents in writing.</li>
<li>The disclosure is allowed by a court order.</li>
<li>The disclosure is made to medical personnel in a medical emergency or to designated and qualified staff for research, audit, or program evaluation.</li>
</ol> Federal law and regulations do not protect any information about a crime committed by a patient either at the program or against any person who works for the program or about any threat to commit such a crime.
<p>Federal laws and regulations do not protect any information about suspected child abuse or neglect from being reported under State law to appropriate state or local authorities.</p>
