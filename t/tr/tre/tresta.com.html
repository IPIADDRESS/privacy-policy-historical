Credit card account numbers are encrypted and stored by a third party that specializes in the collection and maintenance of credit card information.  All personal information, other than credit card numbers, is stored in a protected database that is accessible by a limited number of Tresta employees.  All servers that store customer data have undergone a process known as "security hardening" to improve security and reduce the vulnerability of data stored on the servers consistent with best practices and National Security Agency guidelines.  Customer data may be stored in data centers provided by third parties.  All third-party data centers are compliant with current industry standards. While we follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
