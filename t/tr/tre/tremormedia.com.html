FAQs<br>
What Does Tremor Media Do?<br>
Tremor Media, Inc. (“Tremor Media”) is an online advertising company that offers advertisers opportunities to display their interactive or video ads on top-tier websites.  Our services streamline the selection and delivery of interactive and video ads for advertisers and web publishers.</p>
<p>How Does Tremor Media Deliver Ads?<br>
Ads delivered by Tremor Media appear in primarily two contexts on a website as follows:<br>
(i) in an ad banner or other ad unit on a web page (“rich media ads”) and (ii) as part of a video stream (“in-stream ads”) through a player or widget.</p>
<p>Rich media ads:  Our advertisers’ rich media ads typically feature interactive features, including video.  AdTech, a third party technology vendor, is our agent for delivering our advertisers’ rich media ads.</p>
<p>In-stream ads:  An in-stream ad, similar to a television commercial, appears at the beginning, middle or end of a video stream on a website.  Most of our advertisers’ in-stream ads are delivered by AdTech technology.</p>
<p>How Are Ads Selected for Delivery?<br>
Tremor Media’s customers are advertisers that ask us to display their ads on websites affiliated with Tremor Media (“Tremor Media Network”).  The web publishers that comprise the Tremor Media Network and other websites are subject to their own privacy policies and not the privacy policy of Tremor Media. Advertisers specify where, when and in what context they want their ads to be displayed.  These specifications are sometimes called targeting parameters.</p>
<p>Tremor Media uses AdTech ad serving technology to select, target and deliver ads according to the advertisers’ specifications.   In order to select an ad, the ad serving technology will receive information provided by the web publisher, user’s browser, and advertiser which, in turn, is automatically recorded by the servers of Tremor Media and AdTech.  This information is usually non-personally identifiable, although some web publishers or advertisers may also incidentally provide personally-identifiable information about a user.  Tremor Media does not actively collect, and does not use or store personally- identifiable information about a user.</p>
<p>The AdTech ad serving technology may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies* in order to select, target, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements on the Tremor Media Network and other websites.</p>
<p>Tremor Media and its advertisers may also use ad service providers to help present advertisements on the Tremor Media Network and other websites. These ad service providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to select, target, deliver, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of users.  Tremor Media may share non-personally identifiable information about users with certain ad service providers so that they can help Tremor Media target more relevant advertisements. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by other ad service providers is subject to their privacy policies, not the privacy policy of Tremor Media.  You can find out more about ad service providers and the choices you have about these technologies by clicking on the links at the bottom of these FAQs.</p>
<p>Is Information Transferred to Tremor Media Successors and Affiliates?<br>
Tremor Media may transfer the information it collects in connection with its business to any successor – in – interest to Tremor Media (such as a company that acquires Tremor Media), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent).  Tremor Media may also disclose information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or if Tremor Media determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Tremor Media’s rights or the rights of another user.</p>
