Payments made to and from Trend Revenue require the provision of and certain collection of personally identifiable information that may include bank account information..

				</p>
				<p>
					"Cookies" are files (e.g. flash browser objects or http header) that are stored on your web-enabled client (such as your web browser). There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. Trend Revenue does not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer. Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements. When a consumer responds to or views an Internet advertisement served by Trend Revenue (such as through third-party Web sites or email solicitation) or visits a Trend Revenue Network site, we send a Cookie and/or gif file to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser. One function of these Cookies is to provide Trend Revenue with information for the purpose of paying third-parties commissions when an Internet user clicks on a link, or makes a purchase on a Member Web site or through a Member produced banner or link. If the Internet user re-visits the Member's site, banner or link, Trend Revenue is able to continue to track the user's activities (excluding PII) on the Member's site and reward the referred user. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows Members to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies may also be used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. We also may use Internet browsing and online purchase data associated with an anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical user profile of the end user's needs and interests. We reserve the right to retain all ad delivery and reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and audit purposes. Cookies are also used to simplify Member login and to facilitate secure navigation through the password protected areas of the website. Cookies may also be used to optimize and personalize the member's experience and allow Trend Revenue to monitor log ins and site traffic patterns. Members who choose to reject all cookies will have difficulty navigating the password protected areas of the website.
				</p>
				<p>
					We record the IP address of members at each login, and this information is part of a secure database and is password protected.
				</p>
				<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
				<p>
					 Member information is not shared with any third party outside Trend Revenue, except with your consent or as expressly provided for herein or for that necessary to conduct business such as paying a Member or as required by law. Once an affiliation is established, the security of Member information is crucial to our success in the highly competitive field of online advertising.
				</p>
