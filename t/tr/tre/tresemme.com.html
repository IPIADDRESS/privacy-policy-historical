<p><strong>The  Effective Date of this Privacy Policy is October 22, 2008. </strong></p>


<p><span class="bodybold">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the TRESemm√© web site, <a href="http://www.tresemme.com" target="_blank" class="links">http:/www.tresemme.com</a> which is owned or  controlled by Alberto Culver Company ("Alberto Culver," "we" or  "us"), or other interactive features or downloads that are owned or  controlled by Alberto Culver and made available through the Site or that interact with  the Site and post this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Site and  does not cover any information collected at any other web site or offline by  Alberto Culver (unless specifically stated). This Privacy Policy explains Alberto Culver's  information collection practices at the Site, such as the types of information  Alberto Culver collects regarding visitors to the Site and how we may use that  information. Please review this  Privacy Policy carefully. In  addition, please review the Site's <u><a href="http://www.alberto.com/terms-US-tresemme.htm" class="links">Terms of Use</a></u>, which governs your use of  the Site.</p>


<p><span class="bodybold">THE  INFORMATION THE SITES COLLECT AND  HOW WE USE IT</span></p>
<p></p>


<p><span class="bodybold">Information  You Provide Us</span></p>
<p>The Site may ask you to provide personally  identifiable information, which is information that could be used to contact  you or identify you personally, such as your name, birth date, or e-mail  address ("Personal Information") and other information about you, such as demographic  information (your gender, zip code or similar information) or certain  information about your hobbies, preferences and interests. The Site may collect Personal  Information and other information about you at various places and forms on the Site,  including registration forms, when you submit a question to us, or when you  otherwise communicate or interact with us. If we combine demographic or similar  information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as  Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>Alberto Culver may use your Personal Information: (1) to  provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have  requested or agreed to receive; (2) to process your registration with the Site,  including verifying your email address is active and valid; (3) to improve the  Site or our services, to customize your experience on the Site, or to serve you  specific content that is most relevant to you; (3) to contact you with regard  to your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to the Site policies;  (4) for internal business purposes; and (5) for purposes disclosed at the time  you provide your Personal Information. </p>
<p>If you submit ideas, votes,  comments, reviews, suggestions, photographs, videos, music, text or other  content to the Site, it may be published online or offline in any media or  format (currently existing or hereafter developed). Others may have access to  this content and may have the ability to share it with third parties across the  Internet. Alberto Culver may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other  Personally Information with the content (or any portion of the content), and  Alberto Culver may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising,  marketing, publicity and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding user-generated  content you submit to the Site, please review the Site's <u><a href="http://www.alberto.com/terms-US-tresemme.htm" class="links">Terms of Use</a></u>.</p>
<p>Please note that  information submitted to the Site via a "contact us" or other similar function  may not receive a response. We  will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes  unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise. </p>


<p><span class="bodybold">Your  Public Profile</span></p>
<p>If  you register to join the Site's online community ("Member"), you may  create a public profile that includes your username, your personal photo, and your location, as well as other  information that you choose to post about yourself ("Profile"). This Privacy  Policy does not apply to any information that you disclose publicly or  otherwise upload onto your Profile. In addition, the Site may post publicly  information about your use of the Site as a Member, including information about  the posts you submit or view, how others rank your posts, and other information  about your use of the community features on the Site. If you post Personal  Information through blogs, message boards or other public forums the Site may  make available, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited  messages from other parties. Alberto Culver cannot ensure the security of any  information you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have  access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please  exercise caution when deciding what information to include in your Profile and  when deciding to disclose Personal Information in any public areas of the Site. </p>

<p>You  may edit most of the information you have supplied for your Profile by logging  in and going into "My Profile."  You may request removal of your Profile from the Site by contacting us  through the "Contact Us" feature on the Site.</p>

<p><span class="bodybold">Information You Provide  About A Third Party</span></p>
<p>If  you send someone else communication from the Site, such as sending an article  to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is  used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for  any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person. </p>



<p><span class="bodybold">Information Third  Parties Provide About You</span></p>
<p>We  also may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect with outside  records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to  tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products  or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we  receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Site.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal identifiable  information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time  you provide your personally identifiable information. </p>


<p><span class="bodybold">Information  We Collect As You Access And Use The Site </span></p>
<p>In addition  to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to provide to  us on the Site, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of  technologies that automatically collect certain web site usage information whenever  you visit or interact with the Site. This information may include browser type,  operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page view, among  other information. We may use this web site usage information for a variety of  purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Site. In addition, your IP address or some other unique identifier  for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable  (collectively referred to as a "Device Identifier") may be collected.  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your  computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our  computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your  Device Identifier with the personal information you provide. <br><br>
  The methods that may be used to  collect this information include the following: </p>
  
  
<p><u>Cookies</u>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a computer when it is used to visit the Site.  Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking  user preferences and web pages visited while using the Site. You may disable  cookies using your browser's preferences, but some features of the Site may not  function properly or may operate slowly if you disable the cookies. </p>

<p><u>Web Beacons</u>. Small graphic images or other web  programming code  called web beacons,  (also known as "1x1 GIFs " or "clear GIFs,)" may be included in our web pages and e-mail  messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or  e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used  for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to  the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails  that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or  links were actually viewed. </p>

<p><u>Embedded  Scripts.</u> An embedded script is programming code  that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site,  such as which links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your  computer from our Web server or a third party service provider, is active only  while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted  thereafter. <br>
  Information collected through automatic  means may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. If associated with  you, it will be treated as Personal Information. </p>
<p></p>

We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the  Site, such as hosting the Site, designing and/or operating the Site's features,  tracking Site analytics, enabling Alberto Culver to send you e-mail, or performing  other administrative services. We may provide these companies with access to user  information, including Personal Information, if necessary to carry out the  services they are performing for you or for Alberto Culver. </p>

<p>Sweepstakes,  Contests and Promotions. We may offer  sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a "Promotion")  through the Site that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms,  conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain  specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law,  allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or  likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion.

These other web sites may send their  own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information  and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
