    		The policy outlined below manifests Treato's commitment to privacy. Treato reserves the right to modify this policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting amended privacy policy and terms on this website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.<br><br>
<span class="bold_txt">Treato Search Engine: </span><br><br>
Treato has created the world's most sophisticated search engine for patients' reports on their illnesses, treatments and medications. Treato has identified Billions of reports written by Billions of patients which are dispersed throughout the internet and are contained in hundreds of thousands websites, blogs and other social media. <br><br>
Once identified, Treato applies to each such report sophisticated algorithms that automatically analyze the report. Treato is then able to both direct the viewers to each individual report (based on search criteria determined by its customers), as well as draw statistics and other insights. <br><br>
Occasionally, the writers of the original reports include personal data in their reports, such as: names, email addresses, dates of birth, physical locations etc.<br><br>
<span class="bold_txt">Policy </span><br><br>
<span class="circle">1</span>
<p>With respect to Individual reports identified by Treato:<br>
Treato will not amend the original reports it has identified. To the extent the writers of such original reports have elected to include personal data, any reader of these reports will be able to view such personal data; <br>
However, Treato will omit and not include such personal data in its statistical search engine, so that Treato's search engine will not include criteria to search for Personal Information.<br>
Treato may report adverse event and drug safety information to the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies (both US and internationally) as well as directly to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and healthcare providers and may provide information to Partners and other third parties. In doing so, Treato will remove pieces of personally identifiable information that can reasonably be used to identify the original writer (i.e. "de-identification "); However, Treato cannot prevent such third parties from resorting to personal information contained in the original report.
 </p>
<div class="clear"></div><br>
<span class="circle">2</span>
<p>With respect to searches made by customers of Treato:<br>
Treato will keep confidential all information regarding searches made by individual customers. However, Treato may disclose aggregated search data.
 </p>
<div class="clear"></div><br>
<span class="circle">3</span>
<p>With respect to advertisements:<br>
Treato's business model is based on selling of Premium Services and Products. Treato has no current intention to enable advertisement on individual search pages. However, Treato reserves the right to amend its advertisement policy at any time and if it amends its policy, it will advise its customers of such amendment, in a due notice posted in its website. 
</p>
<div class="clear"></div><br>
<span class="bold_txt">Risks &amp; Benefits:</span><br><br>
Treato's goal is to help patients get access to the wisdom contained in billions of reports, made by billions of patients and dispersed throughout the internet. It strives to make it possible for each individual patient to get access to reports of other patients, who are similarly medically situated. Furthermore, Treato analyzes the aggregated information contained in such reports and enables both individual patients as well as the professional community to enjoy the aggregated wisdom contained in these billions of reports.
