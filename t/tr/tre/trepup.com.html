For example, you may link your Facebook, Google or LinkedIn account to Trepup, which allows us to obtain Personal Data from those accounts. The Personal Data we obtain from these services (e.g., your contact details) often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check them before you link other accounts. Providing any Personal Data to us via a social media platform is beyond our control and made at your own risk as such platforms are hosted by third parties.</p>

                                        <strong class="RobotoLight font23 colorGray">Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, there is generally certain Personal Data that gets created and recorded automatically. The same applies when you use Trepup. Here are some of the types of Personal Data we collect:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">(a) Log data: While using Trepup, our servers automatically record Personal Data, including Personal Data that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your IP address, browser type and settings, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, search terms and cookie data.</li>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">(b) Cookie data: Depending on how you access Trepup, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your User Account or browser) or similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixels, to record log data, analyze trends, gather demographic information or track navigation through our website. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your Trepup settings so you do not have to set them up every time you visit Trepup. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your User Account (including Personal Data about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. You may disable or restrict cookies using your browser’s security settings, but that may impact your experience of using Trepup.</li>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">(c)	Device information: In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device on which you are using Trepup. The device information will include Personal Data such as type of device, operating system, device settings, unique device identifiers and crash data. This helps us make sure that our website displays and functions correctly on your device. Whether we collect some or all of this device information, including Personal Data, often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. For example, different types of device information and Personal Data are available depending on whether you are using a Mac or a personal computer. To learn more about what device information and Personal Data your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">(d) Email information: By using our email marketing service (hereafter the "Email Service"), we may further receive access to the data you provide if you create an email campaign and add a mailing distribution list ("Distribution List") with recipients (your "Contacts"). Such a Distribution List may be created by importing contacts (for further details, please refer to Section 3 of the <a title="Anti-Spam Policy" href="https://www.trepup.com/anti-spam-policy">Anti-Spam Policy<span class="commanspan">).</span></a> The Distribution List is stored on a secure server of Trepup and only authorized employees have access to it. We will solely use and disclose the Personal Information provided in a Distribution List as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will only contact someone on the Distribution List if he or she directly gets in touch with us. We may further share the Distribution List, e.g., with anti-spam organizations, if we detect illegal or abusive behavior.</li>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">(e) Web beacons: We include web beacons on our website and in the emails we send. Web beacons allow us to monitor behavior by collecting information such as who is reading a web page or email, when and from which computer. They can also be used to see if an email was read or forwarded to someone else, or if a web page was copied to another website. This helps us to improve our Products for our users and to measure the performance of our Email Service. We use such collected data from web beacons to generate reports concerning the performance of your email campaigns and the actions of your Contacts. When we send you an email, reports are also available to us, so that we can gather and verify that information.</li>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">(f) FTF links: If one of your Contacts uses the FTF ("Forward to a Friend") link in an email campaign you send, your email content may be shared with individuals that are not on your Distribution List. We do not keep records of your Contacts' or their friend's email address, and do not add anyone to any Distribution List as a result of the FTF if a Contact forwards an email to a friend. Users only see the total amount of times their Contacts forwarded their email campaign and cannot access the email addresses that were used to share or receive the forwarded content.</li>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">(g)	Other sources: In order to develop our features, we may search through the internet to receive further information concerning you or your Contacts, such as IP addresses, demographic information, location, email address, name and use of social media websites.</li>
                                            <li class="topSpace25">We do not have any direct relationship with your Contacts or other individuals you provide us Personal Data with by using our Email Service. Therefore, it is your sole responsibility to obtain the explicit consent of your Contacts for us to collect and process information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Trepup takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any unlawful use of the Email Service. If a Contact no longer wishes to be contacted, he or she can directly unsubscribe from the User Distribution List or ask the User to update or delete him or her from the Distribution List.</li>
