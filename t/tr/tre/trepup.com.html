            <div class="RobotoRegular answerDiv">
                We collect information in two ways:
            </div>
            <div class="RobotoMedium questionDiv">
                a. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.
            </div>
            <div class="RobotoRegular answerDiv1">
                When you use or sign up for Trepup, you voluntarily give us certain information
                such as your name, email address, and password. You can update this information
                anytime by logging in to your Trepup account.
            </div>
            <div class="RobotoRegular answerDiv">
                You may also choose to give us permission to access your information in other services.
                For example, you may link your Facebook, Google+, or LinkedIn account to Trepup,
                which allows us to obtain information from those accounts. The information we obtain
                from those services (e.g., your contact details) often depends on your settings
                or their privacy policies, so be sure to check those before you link other accounts.
            </div>
            <div class="RobotoMedium questionDiv">
                b. We also get technical information when you use our services.
            </div>
            <div class="RobotoRegular termsDiv1">
                Whenever you use any website, mobile application, or other internet service, there
                is almost always certain information that gets created and recorded automatically.
                The same applies when you use Trepup. Here are some of the types of information
                we collect:
            </div>
            <div class="RobotoRegular ulanswerDiv1">

                        servers automatically record information, including information that your browser
                        sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your IP address, browser
                        type and settings, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location,
                        search terms, and cookie data.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="RobotoRegular ulanswerDiv1">
                <ul>

                        access Trepup, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each
                        time you visit our website, unique to your Trepup account or browser) or similar
                        technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies
                        (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until
                        you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your
                        Trepup settings so you do not have to set them up every time you visit Trepup. Some
                        of the cookies we use are associated with your Trepup account (including personal
                        information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies
                        are not. You may disable or restrict cookies using your browser’s security settings,
                        but that may impact your experience of using Trepup.</li>

                        unique device identifiers, and crash data. This helps us make sure that our website
                        displays and functions correctly on your device. Whether we collect some or all
                        of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings.
                        For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you
                        are using a Mac or a personal computer. To learn more about what information your device makes
                        available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software

                We use the information we collect to provide our services to you and make them more
                effective, develop new products and services, and protect Trepup and our users.
                For example, we may compare how different Trepup pages or app screens perform using
                a random sample of users, which helps us understand which page or app screen is
                better.

                Trepup indexes local businesses, across the globe, and helps you find the businesses and solutions that you need. 
                To do this effectively, we may need to share your information at times with others. For example,
                when you create a business page on Trepup, anyone can view it and access your information.
                You may also provide us with profile page information that anyone can view. Other
                limited instances where we may share your information are:

                        to them, then you agree to share information with such services. For example, you

                We use industry-leading technology to keep your information safe. Here are some

                <ul>
                    <li>We automatically encrypt your confidential information in transit from your computer

                        of 128-bits (the highest level commercially available). Before you even sign up
                        for or log in to our website, our server checks that you are using an approved browser
                        - one that uses SSL 3.0 or higher.</li>

                        and are not directly connected to the internet, so your private information is available
                        only to authorized computers.</li>

                        inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and suspend or disable accounts

                are reasonable to protect your information. We disclaim any liability as a result

                We may update this policy from time to time, and if we do, we will post any changes
