                <div class="RobotoBold headingDiv">1. What kind of information do we collect?</div>
                <div class="RobotoRegular answerDiv">We collect information in two ways:</div>
                <div class="RobotoMedium questionDiv">a. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</div>
                <div class="RobotoRegular answerDiv1">When you use or sign up for Trepup, you voluntarily give us certain information such as your name, email address, and password. You can update this information anytime by logging in to your Trepup account.</div>
                <div class="RobotoRegular answerDiv">You may also choose to give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook, Google+, or LinkedIn account to Trepup, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts. The information we obtain from those services (e.g., your contact details) often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check those before you link other accounts.</div>
                <div class="RobotoMedium questionDiv">b. We also get technical information when you use our services.</div>
                <div class="RobotoRegular termsDiv1">Whenever you use any website, mobile application, or other internet service, there is almost always certain information that gets created and recorded automatically. The same applies when you use Trepup. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</div>
                <div class="RobotoRegular ulanswerDiv1">
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="RobotoMedium logData">Log data:&nbsp;</span>While using Trepup, our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your IP address, browser type and settings, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, search terms, and cookie data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="RobotoRegular ulanswerDiv1">
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="RobotoMedium logData">Cookie data:&nbsp;</span>Depending on how you access Trepup, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Trepup account or browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your Trepup settings so you do not have to set them up every time you visit Trepup. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Trepup account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. You may disable or restrict cookies using your browser’s security settings, but that may impact your experience of using Trepup.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="RobotoRegular ulanswerDiv2">
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="RobotoMedium logData">Device information:&nbsp;</span>In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device on which you are using Trepup. The information will include type of device, operating system, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. This helps us make sure that our website displays and functions correctly on your device. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you are using a Mac or a personal computer. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>

                <div class="RobotoRegular termsDiv1">We use the information we collect to provide our services to you and make them more effective, develop new products and services, and protect Trepup and our users. For example, we may compare how different Trepup pages or app screens perform using a random sample of users, which helps us understand which page or app screen is better.</div>
                <div class="RobotoMedium logData">We analyze the information we collect to provide you customized content, including:</div>

                        <li>Suggesting businesses or people you may like to follow.

                        <li>Send you updates about activities on Trepup, newsletters, promotional materials, and other information that may be of interest to you.

We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above.

If you do not have a Trepup account, or do not want us to customize Trepup for you when you are signed out, you can opt out <a class="contactus" href="mailto:admin@trepup.com">here</a>.

We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam). Further, some of the information that may have been shared on third-party websites may still continue to be available as we do not have control over these websites. Your information may also appear in online searches. Other information that you have shared with others, or that other users have copied, may also remain visible.

To do this effectively, we may need to share your information at times with others. For example, when you create a business page on Trepup, anyone can view it and access your information. You may also provide us with profile page information that anyone can view. Other limited instances where we may share your information are:</div>

Before you even sign up for or log in to our website, our server checks that you are using an approved browser - one that uses SSL 3.0 or higher.</li>

Trepup servers sit behind an electronic firewall and are not directly connected to the internet, so your private information is available only to authorized computers.</li>

We further reserve the right to determine the most appropriate manner of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive notices electronically if we so choose.
