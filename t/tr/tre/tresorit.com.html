                <h4>5.&nbsp; Amendment, deletion and destroying of data</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Personal Data</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As a registered user, you can view your Personal Data stored by us at any time as well as edit or delete these data from our database if your Personal Data have changed, or if you decide to stop using Tresor, without limitations.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">You understand and accept that the deletion of your Tresorit account does not mean the immediate deletion of all of your Personal Data stored by us. For identification purposes, Tresorit reserves the right to store your e-mail address for 1 year after your user account has been deleted. Same provision applies to the invitations you have sent out, as Tresorit will store such information for 90 days after their validity has expired. Upon the expiry of the aforementioned deadlines, Tresorit destroys such data in a way that those will not be available again to anyone.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">You also understand and accept that your Personal Data necessary for sending and receiving invitations may remain accessible to persons to whom you sent an invitation, or from whom you received and accepted an invitation, even if your Tresorit account is deleted or the invitation you sent or accepted has expired, or you stop sharing your Stored Content with such persons.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Stored Content</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As a registered user, you can access, edit or delete your Stored Content at any time without limitations. Once your Tresorit account is deleted for any reason, your Stored Content will be automatically deleted as well.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">You understand and accept that in line with the functionality of our services, in case you make any change to your Stored Content, at least 10 previous versions of your Stored Content might remain accessible to you and to the persons with whom you shared such previous versions. You may increase the number of the previous versions of your Stored Content which remains so accessible when setting your Tresorit account. You also understand and accept that previous versions of your Stored Content exceeding this number or your Stored Content which is chosen to be deleted by you or due to the termination of your Tresorit account can be restored for 90 days from the date of such deletion only by you. After the expiry of such deadline your stored content will be destroyed in a way that those cannot be restored and will not be available again to anyone, including you.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">You understand that once you shared all or a part of your Stored Content by using Our Service with any person who accepted your invitation, such Stored Content goes out of your Control and remains accessible by such person to the extent you granted such person access, even if you select to delete or remove your stored content from tresor. Therefore we ask you to pay special attention with whom you share your Stored Content.</p>
                <h4>6. Changes to this Policy</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">As every high-quality service, Our Service is improved constantly in effort to keep users satisfied, but these improvements necessarily mean changes.
