        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">As we collect, store, transmit and process various types of Personal Data, such as full name, email address and other information, we feel that it is essential to make clear the purposes for such operations.

When you invite a Third Party, who is not already a Tresorit user, we store its contact details you provided us, like email address, in order to notify such user about your invitation. We might notify the user not more than 3 times, unless you, or other Tresorit user send an invitation again. We don’t sell any Third Party data, and Third Party can choose not to receive more notifications any time, by using the unsubscribe link included those notifications. </p>
