				    <p class="t">&nbsp;</p>
				    <p><span class="style34 style34">Trafficwala respects your privacy and are committed to protecting personal  information that you may share with us. This Privacy Policy describes how we  may collect and use your personal information.<br>
				    </span><br>
                    <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
			        Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an  individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email  address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information,  title, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when  needed to provide a service or product or carry out a transaction you have  requested. Unless you choose to voluntarily provide the information to us, we  do not collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name,  address, telephone number, fax number, or e-mail address. For instance, you may  be asked to provide us with your personal information when you fill the  required fields for requesting a Pre-SEO Analysis Report or a Contact Us form.  If you elect to submit any personal information, your submission is subject to  the terms of this Privacy Policy and you consent to such terms.<br>
			        This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the <acronym>Trafficwala</acronym> website. On some pages, you can make requests, register to receive materials,  and use free webmaster tools. The types of personal information collected at  these pages are:<br>
			        Name<br>
			        Company name<br>
			        Address<br>
			        Email address<br>
			        Phone number<br>
			        Web address<br>
			        About Your Competitor</p>
				    <strong>Log Files</strong><br>
			        Like many other Web sites, www.trafficwala.com makes use of log files. The  information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses,  type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp,  referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the  site, track userâ€™s movement around the site, and gather demographic  information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any  information that is personally identifiable.<br><br>
                      <strong>Cookies </strong><br>
                    Like many other commercial websites, the Trafficwala website may use  standard technologies, such as "cookies" and other HTML tools, to  collect information about how you use the site or to record that you opened an  email marketing message. As such, we may log your IP address (the Internet  address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you  visit and how long you spend there.<br>
			        Some parts of the Trafficwala website use cookies to track user traffic  patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website  information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is  in helping users reach that information. A cookie is a small data file that  certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file  can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages  you have visited. <br>
			        Some of our advertising partners may use cookies too. These third-party ad  servers or ad networks use technology to the advertisements and links that  appear on www.trafficwala.com sent directly to your browsers. They  automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. Other technologies (such  as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) may also be used by the third-party ad  networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and / or to personalize  the advertising content that you see.<br>
                    <br>
			        Trafficwala has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by  third-party advertisers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of  these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices  as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices.  Trafficwala's privacy policy does not apply to, and have no control over the  activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.<br>
			        If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set  your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when  your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by  turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full  advantage of the Trafficwala website if you do so. In particular, you may be  required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website.  You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many  parts of our website, except access to certain of Trafficwala's web pages that  require a login and password.<br><br>
                      <strong>Notice</strong><br>
                    Trafficwala will not transfer your personal information to third parties  without your consent, except under the limited conditions described under the  section entitled "Information Sharing and Disclosure" below.<br>
                    In most cases we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in"  prior to receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means  we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use  your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was  submitted. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to "opt  out" of receiving such materials. This means we assume you have given us  your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this  Privacy Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not  consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at  the point of collection.<br><br>
                      <strong>How We Use Information Collected</strong><br>
			        Trafficwala uses personal information for several general purposes: to fulfill  your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience  on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements,  software updates, special offers or other information we think you would like  to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better  understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also use  your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you, direct  marketing information or contact you for market research.<br><br>
                      <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
