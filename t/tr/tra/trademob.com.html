<p><strong>Disqus Comment System</strong></p>
<p>The Disqus Comment System is provided by Disqus Inc., San Francisco, USA (“Disqus”). Disqus is an interactive comment system which permits the user to make comments on all websites that also use Disqus with only one registration. Furthermore, the user can also log into the comment system via already existing user accounts with Facebook (via Facebook Connect), Twitter, Yahoo and OpenID. It is also possible to use the comment system as a “guest” without having to register. Additional information on Disqus and its functions can be found at <a href="http://www.disqus.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.disqus.com']);">www.disqus.com</a>.</p>
<p>Disqus Inc. is the responsible entity which may collect, process and/or use personal data which may be given when commenting, even if you use the commenting function as a “guest” without a Disqus account. As such, the data protection provisions and/or terms of use available on the Disqus Inc. website at&nbsp;<a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy']);">http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy</a> &nbsp;and at&nbsp;<a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466260-terms-of-service" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466260-terms-of-service']);">http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466260-terms-of-service</a> apply.</p>
<p>When logging in via existing user accounts with Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo or OpenID, data can also be collected, processed or used by the respective supplier. Information can be found in the data protection provisions of the respective suppliers. In the course of comment administration, Disqus reveals to us the text of the comment as well as the user’s chosen user name, which will be published on our Website together with the comment itself. Our administrators and moderators who are in charge of the comments to the articles have access to such data. Although as a general rule, comments are not read before being published online, their content may at random be reviewed in order to prevent abuse of the commenting function. If we are informed of tangible, evident violation of right, we are obliged to review the respective comment. In order to avoid liability for the comments’ content, it may also be necessary to delete comments or to edit them while making such edit recognizable.</p>
<p>Moreover, Disqus reveals to us the email addresses used with Disqus or the respective supplier (Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo or OpenID) and the IP address via which the comment was posted. We use the email address in order to be able to contact you if there are queries with regard to the comment or if we are held liable for a comment and need to clarify the actual facts. We will not use the email address for any other purpose and will neither publish nor transfer it to third parties. The IP addresses are only used in order to prevent the abuse of the comment function, e.g. if a user misuses the commentary function by posting illegal content.</p>

<p>Depending on the used operating system (e.g. iOS or Android) of your mobile device, the Mobile Platform (mobile app or mobile website) and the agreed advertising services, we may collect some of the following anonymous data relating to your use of such Mobile Platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anonymized (hashed) IP-address</li>
<li>Anonymous identifiers like the ID for Advertising for iOS (IDFA), the Advertising ID for Android (that will fully replace Android-Device-IDs from August 1, 2014) and other anonymous identifiers of third party service providers (like Facebook) that are placed on your mobile device by using cookies</li>
<li>Information contained in your browser head</li>
<li>Installation and first opening of an app on your mobile device</li>
<li>user actions within an app or on a mobile website (e.g. in-app purchases, registration)</li>
<li>information which apps you have downloaded or which mobile websites you have visited</li>
<li>information which advertisements you have seen or clicked on</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect any personally identifiable data for advertising from you and do not combine the foregoing anonymous data with any of your personally identifiable data without your prior consent.</p>
<p>We may also receive such anonymous data from our clients and the third party service providers we work with to deliver and track the advertising and to measure and analyze the performance of the advertising campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Processing and use non-personally identifiable data</strong></p>
<p>We use the above described anonymous data for providing our advertising services to our clients, i.e. we use such data to target specific user groups, to deliver and to track advertising and to measure and analyze the performance of advertising campaigns. On the basis of the anonymous data we retrieve with regard to your use of Mobile Platforms, we delivered to you advertisements that are likely to be more interesting for you (interest-based advertising). With regard to the performance of advertising campaigns, we attribute a click or an impression on an advertisement to a user action that is relevant for our client, e.g. download of an app or an in-app purchase (conversion tracking).</p>
<p>We use the anonymous data to analyze the performance of advertising campaigns of our clients, to provide our clients with performance reports and to assist them in optimizing metrics, targeting and creatives for their advertising campaigns. For the foregoing purposes, however, subject to the next paragraph, we may provide our clients also with non-aggregate anonymous data, like anonymous identifiers, that we have tracked in the course of the advertising campaign conducted for the respective client. Subject to the next paragraph, we also use anonymous data to train, optimize and adjust our advertising tools and services.</p>
<p>If we receive anonymous data regarding your use of Mobile Platforms (including any advertising you have seen or clicked on) from a third party provider we work with in rendering our advertising services, we comply with the restrictions and requirements on the processing and use of such anonymous data as agreed with the third party provider (e.g. we do not provide our clients with the Facebook identifier for advertising on Facebook and do not use the anonymous data provided by Facebook for purposes not relating to the Facebook advertising campaigns for which such data has been provided).</p>
<p>Neither we nor our clients combine the anonymous data collected by us with other data in a way that may be capable to personally identify you or with personally identifiable data of you without your prior consent.</p>
<p><strong>User Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>If you do not want us to use the anonymous data described above for creating an anonymous user profile and delivering interest-based advertising to you, you can opt-out from such use of your data. Please visit the following link and follow the instructions: <a href="http://www.trademob.com/opt-out-for-interest-targeting-2/">click here</a></p>
<p>If you do not want us to process and use at all any anonymous data regarding your use of Mobile Platforms, you can opt-out from such use of your anonymous data. Please visit the following link and follow the instructions: <a href="http://www.trademob.com/opt-tracking-2/">click here</a></p>
<p>Please note that due to technical reasons it may take up to 24 hours to implement and comply with your opt-out in our systems.</p>
<p><strong>Storage and deletion of non-personally identifiable data</strong></p>
<p>In general, any anonymous data we have collected and stored is deleted from our systems if we do not need such data any longer for advertising purposes. If we receive anonymous data regarding your use of Mobile Platforms (including any advertising you have seen or clicked on), from a third party provider we work with in rendering our advertising services, we comply with the storage and deletion deadlines agreed with such third party provider.</p>
