                    <br>As a vital function of a website operator, and during your visit to our website and all of its subdomains and other forms of connection to TraceMyIP service, we collect non-personally-identifying information (unless used with personally identifiable keys obtained through a visitor's ISP provider with a legal warrant) and only that web browsers and servers generally make available. Among the data collected are the IP address (anonymized IP address for all EU visitors), visitor uniqueness (with a help of non-personable identifying browser cookie), browser type and version, browser language, referring URL (excluding personally identifiable variables), visitor ISP provider, hostname, timezone, operating system, screen resolution, and the geo location of midpoint Internet connection that provides us with the country/state and city of the ISPs network distribution line instead of an exact visitor location.
                    
					<br><br><strong>Website visitor data is utilized to</strong>
                    <br><strong>a.</strong> Monitor security of the operations
					<br><strong>b.</strong> Maintain end-user and company account security
                    <br><strong>c.</strong> Prevent and counteract events of abuse monitoring and TOS violations

This type of accounts do not require any personal information to be provided beyond a name (real or fictions), an email address (including anonymous) and basic account settings that may request providing a regional geographical information to determine end-user's timezone or other locality or personal computer devices associated settings.
					<br><strong>b.</strong> Premium service accounts. This type of accounts require providing partial or full billing information that contains personal data such as billing address, name, payment type account number, expiration date, and CVV (card verification value). These are required approve and maintain recurring payments and to prevent financial and other types of fraud.

					<br><br>TraceMyIP uses user provided account and payment information to authenticate each account, provide users with service notifications as instructed by each end-user, process payments and to keep services secure by preventing spam, fraud and abuse.

					<br><br>TraceMyIP does not share any of the shared user information with any third-party except for the payment processor(s) and associated processing mid-points that serve as a bridge between the payment processor and TraceMyIP user interface.

					<br><br>Although TraceMyIP does not share each user's account's tracking data as collected by each end-user, TraceMyIP accounts have facilities to enable each end-user with options to assign authorized account users and to publicly share limited statistics that they collect about the websites for which end-users collect the visitor statistics. End-users bear the full responsibility for using these options and are advised to carefully execute any information sharing with either authorized users or by making their website statistics public.
