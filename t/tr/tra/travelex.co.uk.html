					</ol>
    			<p></p>
				<p>We may make use of the personal information we have collected about you from the Website to enable third party websites to display our advertisements to you. We do not disclose identifiable information about our Website users to our advertisers, but we may provide them with information to help us reach the kind of audience we want to target.</p>
    			
			    <h3>Maintenance of Accurate Information</h3>
			    <p>We strive to ensure that the information we maintain about our customers is accurate, current and complete. We respond to requests from customers to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.</p>
    			
			    <h3>Protection of Information Via Established Security Procedures</h3>
			    <p>When transmitting personal information over the internet, please bear in mind that this is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to the Website. However, when you place an order online, your order is placed over a secure connection and your personal information is encrypted to ensure it remains safe at all times.</p>
    			<p>Once we receive your personal information, we use strict security standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorised access. Where Travelex is required to make paper copies of your personal information, such information is either:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>stored in a secure locked storage facility and when required, archived in the same manner; or</li>
					<li>scanned onto our secure electronic systems (with the original paper copies shredded and destroyed) and, when required, archived in a safe and secure manner.</li>		 
				</ol>
				<p>All personal information which is provided online is stored on our secure electronic systems and archived in a secure manner.</p>				
							
			    <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h3>
			    <p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of the Travelex group (which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006). </p>
			    <p>
					We may disclose your personal information to third parties for the following purposes:
					</p><ol>
						<li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business assets;</li>
						<li>if Travelex or substantially all of its assets or Travelex’s holding company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets; and</li>
						<li>in accordance with the obligations bestowed on us by our third party product issuers so that they may process your order and, unless you have indicated that you would not like us to do so, keep you informed of similar products or services to those which you have bought (please note that these third party product issuers have their own privacy policies and accordingly we cannot accept any responsibility or liability for the handling of personal information by such third parties in accordance with such policies);</li>
						<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with our legal obligations or in order to enforce our conditions of sale (including the Online Terms and Conditions) and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Travelex, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
					</ol>
    			<p></p>
				<p>The personal information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

    			<h3>Access to Information</h3>
    			<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
