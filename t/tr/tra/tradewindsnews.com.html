<p>TradeWinds uses information files (cookies) to customise content and develop our digital publication and services (hereafter referred to as “digital solutions”).&nbsp; Information files or cookies are small data or text files which a website may store on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device, choices and preferences the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term cookies when referring to all files that collect information in this way.</p>

<p>We use cookies for many purposes, primarily for analysis, but also in connection with marketing to customise content and advertising optimally. Examples are:</p>

<p>General statistics for our digital solutions and their performance</p>

<h3><strong>Fixed cookies</strong></h3>

<p>These cookies are used to collect information on authentication and preferences. They aren’t deleted when you exit the browser but on a later designated date, or when you delete them yourself. By using these cookies we optimise the performance of our services and can make sure your log-in details and preferences are remembered the next time you log on. We also use them to track your use of the website and to remind you to update your subscription details from time to time.</p>

If you click on links provided by a third party, terms and conditions for these third-party suppliers apply, including their cookie policies. We allow advertisers to place such cookies on their advertisements to enable them to monitor the efficiency of their advertising. This is limited to anonymous data and cannot be traced back to you as a person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disabling cookies</p>

<p>You may at any point disable cookies in the settings or internet options menu in your browser. There are also tools that can monitor and give you the overview of which cookies are used on the web pages you visit.

TradeWinds is distributed via first class mail, and subject to deadlines stated by the individual mail service companies globally. In many central shipping locations we offer hand delivery. If you do not receive your newspaper copy, please contact your local sales office as soon as possible.</p>

<p>New subscriptions and changes to distribution details can be received up until Wednesday morning at 10am GMT for that week’s Friday issue. TradeWinds is printed in the UK, and distribution is dependent on your location.</p>

All subscriptions are renewed unless notice is given. Cancellation is always required in writing either by letter or email. If a cancellation is received after the renewal &nbsp;date, a balance invoice will be payable for the period used. We reserve the right to terminate the subscription at any time due to lack of payment.</p>
