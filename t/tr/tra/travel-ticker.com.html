<a name="pp1"></a><h3>What information we collect from you</h3>
<p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other
    way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name,
    and email address. We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, and frequent flyer and car
    rental program information. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about
    you is required in order for you to register as a member; book travel; complete a traveler profile; participate in
    a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question.</p>
<p><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal
    information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and
    add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address
    information, purchase history, and demographic information.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit
    this website. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or
    Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as
    trips viewed and bookings made. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping customize your
    user experience and inhibiting fraud. For more information, please see <a href="#pp6">Cookies and other
    technologies</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq">
<a name="pp2"></a><h3>How we use your information</h3>
<p>We use information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you
    request; to manage your account; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to
    measure interest in and improve our products, services, and website; to notify you about special offers and products
    or services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this website; to reward you
    as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through
    surveys; to resolve disputes or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to
    enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</p>
<p>We often receive testimonials and comments from customers who have had positive booking and/or travel experiences on
    our website. We occasionally publish such content, using first name plus last initial, only, for attribution.</p>
<p><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our
    website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent
    travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website, we may send
    you an email message reminding you about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email
    from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a
    link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers. We believe
    these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available
    through our site. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages
    in any such email we send.</p>
<p>Please review <a href="#pp5">Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information</a> below.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq">
<a name="pp3"></a><h3>With whom we share your information</h3>
<p>This website may share your information with the following entities:</p>
<p><strong>Third-party vendors</strong> who provide services or functions on our behalf, business analytics, customer
    service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize
    third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website
    or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to
    and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the
    information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Business partners</strong> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or
    services may be offered on our website. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service
    you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose to access these
    optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners.
    Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.</p>
<p><strong>Referring websites:</strong> If you were referred to this website from another site (for example, through
    a link you clicked on another site that directed you to this one), we may share some information about you with
    that referring website. We have not placed limitations on the referring websites' use of your personal information
    and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here.</p>
<p><strong>Companies within our corporate family:</strong> We may share your personal information with our parent
    company and corporate affiliates, such as Expedia.com, TripAdvisor, CarRentals.com and Hotels.com, as well as
    international corporate affiliates such as Hotels.uk.com. This sharing enables us to provide you with information
    about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our parent
    company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least
    as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws
    governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any
    commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.</p>
<p>We also may share your information:</p>
<ul class="items">
    <li>In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to
        defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or
        waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
    <li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected
        illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website,
        our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.</li>
    <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in
        the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third
    parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.</p>
<p>We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For
    example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our website receives or the most popular hotels and
    vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content
    and services we hope you will find of interest.</p>

<a name="pp6"></a><h3>Cookies and other technologies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits).
    This website use cookies for the following general purposes:</p>
<ul class="items">
    <li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have
        been set while your browser was visiting this site. For example, if you register on this site, we may use
        cookies to remember your registration information. Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other
        account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. Unless you register with
        us, these cookies will not contain any personal information.</li>
    <li>To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other sites across
        the Internet. For example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie is automatically set by us, our
        service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present
        you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See <a href="#pp7">Display of
        advertising/Your choices</a> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.</li>
    <li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email
        communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon).</li> 
</ul>
<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
    how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note
    that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our site.</p>
<p>In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as "flash cookies," on our website.
    These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such
    as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website. Local Shared Objects are
    similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do
    anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable
    information that you have provided on this site, and cannot be accessed by other websites. To find out more about
    flash cookies or how to disable them, please click here:

<p>This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with
    a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons
    to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our site to another, to deliver or communicate with
    cookies, to understand whether you have come to this site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party
    website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us
    understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on this site.
    This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>

<a name="pp7"></a><h3>Display of tailored advertising/Your choices</h3>
<p><u>Data collected by this website to serve you with relevant advertising.</u> Travel Ticker is committed to providing you
    with relevant content and information. To do this, we may collect, through <a href="#pp6">cookies and other
    technologies</a> information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline
    flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads, on our website or elsewhere online, that match
    your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on our site, you may see an ad for
    a Florida travel package on our site or on another website you visit.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this website
    with personal information (such as email address) to serve you with ads across other websites. We also do not share
    your personal information with third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to
    receive tailored online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on this website,
    by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that if you choose not to receive
    tailored ads, you will see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.</p>
<p><u>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising.</u> The advertisements you
    see on this website are served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect
    information about your online activities through <a href="#pp6">cookies and other technologies</a>.
    These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of
    their advertisements on our site, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when
    you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The
    information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or
    preferences and to display advertisements on our site and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.
    We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you on our site, nor do we share with
    them any personal information about you.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over <a href="#pp6">cookies or other technologies</a>
    these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these
    third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These companies may offer you a way to opt out of ad
    targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and
    following the links to the websites of each company. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising
    Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please
    click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><u>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising.</u> Like other
    companies operating online, Travel Ticker participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is
    collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics
    of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers
    and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information
    (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such
    information about you on our site. Please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">here</a> to
    learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest
    associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs.</p>
