This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 23, 2016. </p> <p> We understand that booking online involves significant trust on your part. We value your trust, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Please read the following policy to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting this website, you are accepting the practices described herein. </p> <p class="line" id="item-1"> <strong>What information we collect from you</strong> </p> <p> <b>Subscribers:</b> We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, and email address. We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, and frequent flyer and car rental program information. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; book travel; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question. </p> <p> <b>Information from Other Sources:</b> We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information. </p> <p> <b>Automatic Information:</b> We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit this website. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and bookings made. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping customize your user experience and inhibiting fraud. For more information, please see <a href="#item-6">Cookies and other technologies</a>. </p> <p class="line" id="item-2"> <strong>How we use your information</strong> </p> <p> We use information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to manage your account; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and website; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this website; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection. </p> <p> <b>E-mail Communications:</b> We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website, we may send you an email message reminding you about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send. </p> <p class="line" id="item-3"> <strong>With whom we share your information</strong> </p> <p> This website may share your information with the following entities: </p> <p> <b>Third-party vendors</b> who provide services or functions on our behalf, business analytics, customer service, marketing, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose. </p> <p> <b>Business partners</b> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our website. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners. </p> <p> <b>Referring websites:</b> If you were referred to this website from another site (for example, through a link you clicked on another site that directed you to this one), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We have not placed limitations on the referring websites' use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here. </p> <p> <b>Business partners:</b> We may share your personal information with our business partners, such as Booking.com. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. </p> <p> We also may share your information: </p> <ul> <li> In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. </li> <li> When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements. </li> <li> In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. </li> </ul> <p> Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have and opportunity to choose not to have us share such information. </p> <p> We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.

For example, if you register on this site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information. Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. Unless you register with us, these cookies will not contain any personal information. </li> <li> To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other sites across the Internet.

See <a href="#item-7">Display of advertising/Your choices</a> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices. </li> <li> To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon). </li> </ul> <p> This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our site to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to this site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on this site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings. </p> <p> If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please <a href="mailto:support@travel-ticker.com">email us</a>. </p> <p class="line" id="item-7"> <strong>Display of tailored advertising/Your choices</strong> </p> <p> Data collected by this website to serve you with relevant advertising:<br> Travel Ticker is committed to providing you with relevant content and information. To do this, we may collect, through <a href="#item-6">cookies and other technologies</a> information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads, on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on our site, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on our site or on another website you visit. </p> <p> Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this website with personal information (such as email address) to serve you with ads across other websites. We also do not share your personal information with third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on this website, by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you. </p> <p> Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising:<br> The advertisements you see on this website are served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through <a href="#item-6">cookies and other technologies</a>. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our site, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our site and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you on our site, nor do we share with them any personal information about you. </p> <p> Please note that we do not have access to or control over <a href="#item-6">cookies or other technologies</a> these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These companies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to the websites of each company. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> <p> Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising: <br> Like other companies operating online, Travel Ticker participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site. Please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs. </p> <p class="line" id="item-8"> <strong>How we protect your information</strong> </p> <p> We want you to feel confident about using this website to make hotel and travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. </p> <p class="line" id="item-9"> <strong>Children's privacy</strong> </p> <p> This is a general audience website and does not offer services directed to children.
