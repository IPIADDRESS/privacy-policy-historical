                            changing communication medium, it should not come

                              that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. 
                              For instance, viewing this page on our web site. 
                              We know how many individuals view it, but we do 
                              not necessarily know their names, where they live, 
                              or their date of birth. What we collect from transactions

                            <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> refers

                              of our customers, you will find it beneficial to 
                              disclose this information. </p>
                            <p>There are two primary sections in the TrafficBee 
                              where personal information is necessary. The first 
                              area where personal information is needed is when 
                              you subscribe to the basic service. Remember, the 
                              service is completely customized using your personal 
                              profile. Your information is necessary to deliver 
                              the service. The second area is if you choose to 
                              receive a RideGuide. The RideGuide is provided by 
                              the Southern California Association of Governments 
                              Commuter Services Department. This service is free 
                              and all your personal information is presented to 
                              SCAG to determine whether there are other individuals 
                              you may share a ride with.</p>
                            <p>The amount of Personally Identifiable Information 
                              that you choose to disclose to Trafficbee.com is 
                              completely up to you. The only way we know something 
                              about you personally is if you register for a personalized 
                              service or promotion. In other words, we will know 
                              Personally Identifiable Information about you only 
                              if you choose to share this type of information 
                              with us.</p>
                            <p>When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser 
                              (such as Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft Internet 
                              Explorer) automatically transmits some information 
                              to Trafficbee.com every time you access content 
                              on one of our sites. Examples of such information 
                              include the URL of the web page you were just on 
                              (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) 
                              address of the computer you are using, or the browser 
                              version you are using to access our site. All of 
                              this information is collected by Trafficbee.com 
                              and is used to help improve our offerings to you. 
                              For instance, we use this information to determine 
                              the fastest and most concise method possible for 
                              you to download the TrafficBee executable file to 
                              your computer - simplifying the entire download 
                              process.</p>
                            <p>To enable many of the features available within 
                              the TrafficBee sites, we will assign "cookies" to 
                              your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator 
                              or Microsoft Internet Explorer). A cookie is a small 
                              text file that contains a unique identification 
                              number stored on your computer. Cookies by themselves 
                              cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. 
                              This unique identification number automatically 
                              identifies your browser - but not you - to our server 
                              computers whenever you interact on one of our Internet 
                              domains. When you visit our site, a cookie is read 
                              by our server computers. Every web page that you 
                              access that includes advertising or content served 
                              from Trafficbee.com will have the contents of your 
                              cookie reported in our server logs. But only when 
                              you agree to provide Personally Identifiable Information 
                              directly to a TrafficBee branded service, such as 
                              through registration, will we be able to know anything 
                              about you other than the random number that our 
                              server computers originally assign to your browser.</p>
                            <p>There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how 
                              they are used, and what they can do. Cookies only 
                              contain information that the server computer "knew" 
                              in the first place, and can only be read by the 
                              serving domain that placed them. Cookies are an 
                              essential part of how the Internet works today, 
                              and allow server computers to recognize your computer's 
                              browser when you return. If you have ever gone to 
                              a web page that automatically provides personalized 
                              content without you having to "sign in," such as 
                              your own stock portfolio, this is almost certainly 
                              being accomplished with a cookie. Since cookies 
                              are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer 
                              and have no ability to search your computer for 
                              other information, or transmit it to anyone.</p>
                            <p>Cookies are part of the technology implemented 
                              by your web browser. But don't just take our word 
                              for it - read what the companies who wrote the browsers 
                              have to say!</p>

                            <p>Our services have been designed to enable Trafficbee.com 
                              to provide hyper-local, personally relevant traffic 
                              and related content to those customers who wish 
                              to receive it. Our ability to provide enhanced services 
                              and content to our customers is dependent on our 
                              ability to provide venues for our partners that 
                              reach specific demographic segments of our customer 
                              base. Generally, our partners have little interest 
                              in reaching a specific customer of our services 
                              - they are more interested in making sure their 
                              information is reached within a geographic area. 
                              As a matter of policy we provide no mechanism for 
                              a partner to reach you or any other specific customer, 
                              directly. Instead, our partners have the need to 
                              reach customers who share common demographic characteristics 
                              such as a specific commute route. For instance, 
                              we may send broadcasts directed to TrafficBee subscribers 
                              in south Orange County regarding a construction 
                              project. Any subscriber commuting through that corridor 
                              will receive the notice. </p>
                            <p>Below is a description of the uses of the information 
                              that we collect and how our visitors and partners 
                              benefit from broadcast:</p>
                            <p>We provide personalized content in the form of 
                              traffic conditions, construction information, road 
                              maintenance, commuter information, camera images, 
                              and more to our users. We pay attention to what 
                              our customers do and do not use on our service and 
                              modify our content appropriately. The creation of 
                              your profile allows Trafficbee.com to match your 
                              demographic characteristics and commuter profile, 
                              without ever knowing that customer's name or any 
                              other Personally Identifiable Information about 
                              them. These anonymous profiles are used to target 
                              advertising - primarily banners - to those customers, 
                              both on the Trafficbee.com domain and any of the 
                              other Internet domains where we serve advertising. 
                              Through the use of anonymous profiles, Trafficbee.com 
                              can serve advertising to our customers that is more 
                              likely to be for products they would want, and sell 
                              that advertising for a higher price. This is essential 
                              to our ability to provide high quality content to 
                              our customers for free. </p>
                            <p>Trafficbee.com never matches "Who you are" with 
                              "Where you've been" on the Internet because we do 
                              not use personal data characteristics such as your 
                              name, address or phone number to create these anonymous 
                              profiles but rather use primary demographic characteristics 
                              such as your age or gender. Finally, anonymous profiles 
                              present no privacy risk to our customers because 
                              they are worthless to third parties. Since any potential 
                              third party would be unable to read the cookies 
                              that we set on our domains, only Trafficbee.com 
                              can create value from these anonymous profiles.</p>
                            <p>We develop summary - but not individual - reports 
                              for our advertisers. An example of a summary report 
                              might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement 
                              'X' today, and of those people, 35% had previously 
                              indicated they had an interest in sports." Our advertisers, 
                              who make it possible for you to use Trafficbee.com 
                              for free, need this information to determine how 
                              effective their advertising investments are. We 
                              never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or 
                              clicked on their advertisements, unless you have 
                              specifically told us it is acceptable to do so.</p>

                              Due to the way the Internet technically operates,
