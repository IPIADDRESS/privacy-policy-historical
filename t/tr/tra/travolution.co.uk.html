If you block these cookies then certain aspects of the site may not operate properly (as they rely on the cookies to work).</p><p>We undertake these activities because we have a legitimate interest in doing so and, for most of the cookies in question, because we need to do so in order to deliver the parts of the Websites that you are trying to access to you.</p><p><u><br>Third Party Cookies and Resources</u></p><p>We also use the services of third parties to help us to collect various data about you and the way that you use the Website in order to enable us to better understand your interests – both so that we can produce and serve content to you that we think will be of interest to you, and so that we can ensure that you are shown adverts delivered by third parties which are more likely to be of interest to you.</p><p>Where we use cookies to deliver these kind of services, the delivery of those cookies will be subject to your consent and you will be given the opportunity to refuse those cookies prior to them being deployed to your computer.
