                <p><b>Your Privacy is Important to Us</b><br>
				We value your Membership and your privacy is very important to 
				us. Travis Credit Union respects your concerns about maintaining 
				privacy of your personal information. We want to assure you that 
				we maintain strict security procedures to protect your 
				information.<br>
				<br>
				We are committed to providing you with competitive products and 
				services to meet your financial needs, which necessitates that 
				we share information about you to complete your transactions and 
				to provide you with certain financial opportunities. In order to 
				do so, we have entered into agreements with nonaffiliated third 
				party financial service providers and other companies that 
				provide either services to us or additional financial products 
				for you to consider. We may also disclose information about you 
				under other circumstances as permitted or required by law. These 
				disclosures typically include information to follow your 
				instructions as you authorize, process transactions on your 
				behalf, conduct our operations, or protect the security of our 
				financial records.<br>
				<br>
				It is the policy of Travis Credit Union not to sell any 
				information to anyone or provide any member information to any 
				list service for independent use.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Information We Collect About You</b><br>
				To help us serve your financial needs, provide member service, 
				offer new products and services and fulfill legal and regulatory 
				requirements, we collect nonpublic personal information about 
				you as follows:<br>
				</p><ul>
					<li>Information you provide to us verbally or in writing on 
					our membership application, loan applications, and other 
					applications and forms, such as your name, address, Social 
					Security Number, date of birth, assets, income and debt<br>
					</li>
					<li>Information about your transactions with us, such as 
					loan and share account histories and balances, payment 
					history, ATM, and Credit and Check Card activity.<br>
					</li>
					<li>Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies, 
					such as your credit history or report and credit score.<br>
					</li>
					<li>Passwords, Personal Identification Numbers, or other 
					access codes created or that you create in connection with 
					products or services we offer.<br>
					</li>
					<li>Other sources, to verify the information you provide on 
					applications, such as account and loan balances at other 
					financial institutions as well as income and employment.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>Information We Disclose<br>
					<br>
					</b><u>Disclosure to Nonaffiliated Third Parties</u><br>
					We may disclose non-public information in order to provide 
					you with the products and services that you request or to 
					effect, administer or enforce a transaction that you request 
					or authorize. We may also disclose non-public personal 
					information about you to the following types of 
					non-affiliated third parties:</p><ul>
						<li>Financial service providers, such as ATM networks, 
						mortgage insurers, escrow and title companies, bill 
						payment processors, credit reporting agencies and 
						similar consumer reporting agencies like ChexSystems<br>
						</li>
						<li>Non-financial companies, such as check printers, 
						data processors and businesses that prepare and 
						distribute our account statements and marketing 
						information<br>
						</li>
						<li>Others, such as technical service consultants and 
						Internet services companies.<br>
						</li>
						<li>Non-public personal information about you to 
						nonaffiliated third parties as permitted or required by 
						law</li>
						</ul>
						<p><u>Disclosure Under Marketing 
						Arrangements</u><br>
						We may also disclose information we collect (excluding 
						your account numbers, PINs, passwords, other access 
						codes, and Social Security Number) as described in 
						“Information We Collect About You” above, to 
						nonaffiliated third party companies that perform 
						marketing and related services on our behalf, and to 
						other financial service providers with whom we have 
						joint marketing agreements, for the purpose of marketing 
						and targeted direct mail solicitations of financial 
						products and services that we believe may be of value 
						and interest to you. In all instances, we only disclose 
						the limited information necessary to perform these 
						services and do not share information we have collected 
						about you, except as permitted by law.<br>
						<br>
						<b>If You Terminate Your Relationship 
						With Us</b><br>
						If your credit union Membership is terminated we will 
						not share information we have collected about you, 
						except as permitted or required by law.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Confidentiality and Security</b><br>
						To protect your privacy, we work only with companies 
						that agree to maintain strong confidentiality 
						protections and limit the use of information that we 
						provide. All agreements with other companies, including 
						joint marketing agreements, contain required 
						confidentiality clauses that prohibit these companies 
						from selling the information we provide to them to other 
						third parties and require them to safeguard the 
						information while in their possession.<br>
						<br>
						We restrict access to nonpublic personal information 
						about you to those employees who have a specific 
						business in utilizing your data. Our employees are 
						trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality 
						and customer privacy. We maintain physical, electronic, 
						and procedural safeguards that comply with federal 
						regulations, California state laws and leading industry 
						practices to safeguard your nonpublic personal 
						information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Safeguarding Your Own Privacy</b><br>
						Each individual also has a responsibility to safeguard 
						their financial information. 
				</p><p>Protect your account numbers, PINs and passwords. Never keep 
				your PIN with your debit, ATM or credit card, which could 
				provide access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen. 
				</p><p>Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, Social 
				Security numbers, etc. to other persons. If someone calls you, 
				explains the call is on behalf of the credit union and asks for 
				your account number, do not divulge that information. Official 
				credit union staff will have access to your information and will 
				not need to ask for it. 
				</p><p>Keep your information current. We need to have current 
				information on how to reach you. If we detect or suspect 
				possible fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an 
				account, we need to be able to contact you. <br>
