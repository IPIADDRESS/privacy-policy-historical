<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
TraitPerception, Inc. (“TraitPerception” or “we”) operates the Traity services to
help you reach new opportunities based on who you really are in terms of your
personality strengths. We provide you with services so that you can learn more
about yourself, provide and receive feedback from others, search for a job,
source leads for recruiting or sales, create and maintain a professional proﬁle,
and build your network of professional connections.
</p>
<p>
We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies regarding the
collection, use, disclosure and protection of information. This Privacy Policy
applies to all of the Traity websites, mobile features, applications, and other
interactive features or services that link to it (“Traity Services”), including the
Traity websites (http://traity.com) (the “Traity Site”), the Traity mobile applications
and the Traity applications and pages on Facebook (the “Traity App”). Your use of
the Traity Services is subject to our Terms of Service. If you access the Traity
Services through Facebook, you may be required to read and accept the
Facebook terms of service and privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
At Traity we understand you want to keep your personal and professional life
separate. We only take the information from Facebook that helps us assess your
Personality and Cultural Fit, and you have full control over what is made public
and private. We never store your password or email your contacts without your
explicit consent. You can also unsubscribe from all email communication in the
footer of all our emails.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Our policy concerning children under 13</strong>. The Traity Services are not intended
for children younger than the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently
gathered personal information from children younger than the age of 13, we will
take reasonable measures to delete such information from our records.
</p>
<h3>2. Traity Community Basics</h3>
<p>
Through the Traity Services, we provide you with the tools to instantly discover
your strengths and weaknesses as perceived by yourself and by your contacts,
and start a professional network based on your existing Facebook proﬁle and
comprised of your friends and their friends and that you can expand as you
connect with other Traity members and friends. You also have the opportunity for
potential employers, business partners, Traity customers, professional contacts
and friends (the “Traity Community”) to ﬁnd you. We allow our members to communicate and collaborate with each other, learn about business opportunities
and jobs and obtain Introductions. Additionally, Traity users may celebrate
success stories, engage in activities and acknowledge our community’s pool of
talent. You may also have the opportunity to post certain of your Traity activity to
Facebook or other third party forums or to have us do so on your behalf
(although we don´t request this permission by default).
</p>
<p>
Below we summarize what it means to be part of the Traity community and how
your professional proﬁle and activity will be displayed among the Traity
Community, on Facebook, and publicly.
</p>
<p>
Your Traity Proﬁle is your extended resume on the Internet, including your
personality strengths and weaknesses, so that you can ﬁnd you the best
companies for “Cultural Fit” . Your “Traity Proﬁle” consists of your information and
activities on Traity, including your work history, education, personal and
professional work and accomplishments, your connections, your self-evaluation
personality, the feedback you receive from other connections, anything you post
about yourself or within your proﬁle and actions you take within Traity.
Your Traity Proﬁle may be publicly visible to everyone on the Internet. Traity
allows you to control whether certain information is public (but note the default
may be that certain information in your Traity Proﬁle is designated “everyone”
and will be publicly available). You can visit your Account Settings to change this.
</p>
<p>
Your Traity Proﬁle can be accessed through the Traity Services (e.g., by
searching for your name on Traity or by clicking on your name listed on a
Connection’s proﬁle) or directly through a simple URL (http://traity.com/namesurname), which you can share or display as you choose (for example, on your
email signature or blog).
</p>
<p>
There are several types of users on Traity, and you may interact with these users
in different manners, including through public posts and private messaging
features within Traity:
</p>
<p>
• Traity User. A Traity User is a user who has registered to join Traity
by installing any of our mobile or web applications or who has
otherwise registered for Traity.• Extended Network Member. An Extended Network Member is a
person who has not installed any Traity application but is
connected to a Traity User through other social networks (e.g., a
Facebook friend or second-degree Facebook friend).
<br>
• Connections. A user’s Connections consist of (1) that user’s
connections on Traity to Traity Users and (2) Extended Network
Members. Additionally, when you join Traity you are automatically
connected on Traity to your Facebook friends who are Traity Users
and Extended Network Members. You may, however, remove such
connections from Traity.
<br>
• Enterprise Users. Enterprise Users are corporate customers who
use Traity for networking, recruiting and business development
purposes. Notwithstanding your privacy settings, Enterprise Users
can view any information in your Traity Proﬁle that is designated for
“Everyone” or for “Connections Only.”
</p>
<p>
If you are a Traity User, we may provide functionality such that when you
view another Traity user’s proﬁle, that user will be able to view certain
information about you (such as your proﬁle photo and your name,
company, title, and city).You may be able to view Traity proﬁles without
disclosing that information by changing your account settings.
</p>
<p>
You may restrict the visibility of information displayed on your Traity
Proﬁle using our different privacy settings: “Strengths” (will show only
your personality strengths), “My personality” (will show your full
personality information) and “No Personality” (will not show any of your
personality information). To change your privacy preferences visit
Account Settings. You can also set your proﬁle as “Public” or “Private” if
you don´t want to be searchable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Public Proﬁle Searchability</strong>: If your BranchOut Proﬁle is public, BranchOut
makes it available for indexing on search engines, subject to the search engines’
own indexing schedules. Thus, there will likely be a delay before your Traity
Proﬁle initially appears in a search engine’s search results and before any update
you make to your Traity Proﬁle is reﬂected on a search engine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Default Post Visibility</strong>: When you join Traity, by default your Personality Reports
with the answers you provide and the feedback you receive will be visible to
Everyone. You can change your default post visibility in Account Settings.
</p>
<h3>3. Information We Receive</h3>
<p>
Traity believes that your friends and family are your true support network both
personally and professionally. They are the people who really know you, and can
assess your personality strengths and potential cultural ﬁt with companies. Thus,
Traity allows you to establish a professional network on Traity based on your
Facebook friends and their network.
</p>
<h4>A Note About How Traity Works.</h4>
<p>
Our Services analyze data that is available on private social networks when
authorized by our users to access such data, and data that is provided by users
about their own personality (self-evaluation) and endorsement or Feedback
about the personalities of their contacts to measure personality reputation and
create scores for Internet users, including, but not limited to, our registered users.
Traity presents some of this data on the Site and our mobile application(s), such
data may also be available on other websites and Traity may share this data with
our third party partners (as described in more detail below).
</p>
<h4>Opting Out of Traity.</h4>
<p>
If you are not a user of the Services and wish to opt out, please click here: http://
traity.com/optout. If you are a current user of the Services, you can opt-out by
logging into your account and then accessing the link above.
By accessing Traity with your Facebook ID, you are authorizing Traity to collect,
store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that
you agreed that Facebook could provide to BranchOut through the Facebook’s
Application Programming Interface (“API”). Your agreement takes place when
you “accept” or “allow” (or similar term) the Traity App via Facebook. You may
also grant us additional permissions at other times. Information is provided to us
by Facebook under the terms of Facebook’s data use policy (or other applicable
Facebook policy). Traity will only access additional information from your
Facebook account with your consent.
</p>
<p>
Traity will access and store certain information from your current Facebook
proﬁle (for example, your ﬁrst and last name, email address, current city and
state, your work history and education, your proﬁle picture, your Facebook user
ID number), all in accordance with the permissions you have granted Traity. We
also access your friends’ names and applicable user ID number, work history and
education so that you can create and build your professional network.Importantly, you can change your proﬁle photo on Traity to reﬂect your profession
and this will not change your Facebook proﬁle photo which may be more
personal. Also, in order to help you instantly build your professional network,
Traity will continue to update your network of friends and their friends, but the
rest of your Traity proﬁle will not change if you change your Facebook proﬁle
Traity will store the information about your self-evaluation personality test results
and the personality feedback you receive from your contacts, and will use this
report as part of your Traity Proﬁle. You can set whether you want this
information shared or not on your Account Settings.
</p>
<p>
We and our third party service providers, including third party network advertising
companies and content providers, may use a variety of technologies that
automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit or
interact with the Traity Services (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may
include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or
advertisement that referred you to the Traity Site, the search terms you entered
into a search engine that lead you to Traity (if applicable), and information about
your interactions with the Traity Services (such as the pages and content you
view and actions you take, the time you accessed Traity, and the duration of that
period of access), among other information.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Usage Information also includes your IP address or other unique
identiﬁer (“Device Identiﬁer”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device
(any, a “Device”) you may use to access the Traity Services. A Device Identiﬁer is
a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a web
site, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identiﬁer. If you use the
Traity Services on a mobile device, we may also receive information about your
mobile device, such as your UDID, mobile operating system, the name of your
mobile carrier, and your location information (e.g., GPS coordinates or networkbased location). Usage Information is collected through the use of server log ﬁles
and tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons and embedded
scripts. In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID
number for our internal use.
</p>
<p>
The methods we may use to collect Usage Information include the following:• Cookies: A cookie is a data ﬁle placed on a Device when it is used
to visit the Traity Services or otherwise access our online content.
<br>
• Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without
limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking
your visits to our web pages. A Flash cookie is a data ﬁle placed on
a Device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or
downloaded by you to your Device. Flash cookies may be used for
various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash
feature and remembering your preferences. For more information
about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit this site. If
you choose to disable cookies or to adjust your Flash privacy
settings on your Device, some features of the Traity Site may not
function properly.
<br>
• Web Beacons: A web beacon is a small (often invisible) graphic
image or other web programming code embedded in a web page
or email. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a
number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors
to the Traity Services, to monitor how users navigate the Traity
Services and to count how many e-mails that were sent were
actually opened.
<br>
• Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that
is designed to collect information about your interactions with the
Traity Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily
downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third party
service provider and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
</p>
<p>
We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are
on another web site or are using another app and you agree to receive
information from Traity, that web site or app will forward your contact and other
information to us so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose
to participate in a Traity or third party application or features (such as a widget
that allows you to import your Traity proﬁle information to a third party site)
through which you allow us (or the third party) to collect or share information
about you, including Personal Information. The third party may allow you to
remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect
information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the
information previously collected.
</p>
<p>
Traity may offer you the ability to import your professional information from your
resume or through third party services so that you can display such information in your Traity Proﬁle. Any information that you choose to import will become part of
your Traity Proﬁle. Traity may also offer the ability to help you import your
contacts to the Traity Services, for instance, by asking for your login information
for your email account. If you choose to import contacts, Traity will store those
contacts for purposes of helping you and your contacts make connections on
Traity. Traity will not store the passwords you provided without your consent.
</p>
<p>
As noted above in “Information We Receive From Facebook”, Traity receives
certain information from Facebook when you use the Traity Services. In addition,
we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give
us access to their proﬁles and you are one of their “connections” or information
about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, proﬁle
page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or
interactive service.
</p>
<p>
We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from
third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have
requested.
</p>
<p>
We combine the information we receive from those other sources with
information we collect through the Traity Services, like your personality
evaluation and the personality strengths feedback from your contacts. In those
cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
</p>
<h3>4. How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>
We may use your information as disclosed to you at the time you provide it or
choose to participate in a feature or otherwise with your consent. In addition,
Traity uses your Personal Information and Usage Information to register you for,
and enable you to use, the Traity Services, like providing you with your Traity
personality reports and allowing you to search other proﬁles; to help serve you
relevant and meaningful content; to improve the Traity Services and for our
internal business purposes; to contact you regarding the Traity Services (e.g., to
respond to your customer support inquiries, to update you regarding the activity
of your Connections, to provide you with professional opportunities); to enable
you to take polls, quizzes, and surveys; and to send you promotional messages
on our behalf or on behalf of our partners. You can opt out of receiving
promotional messages by clicking “unsubscribe” in the message or changing
your email settings in the Account Settings. If you disclose information to Traity in a quiz, or survey, we may use the results from these activities in our recruiting
efforts, and third parties may target advertising to you based on your responses.
</p>
<p>
Traity also uses your Personal Information and Usage Information to enable you
to interact with other Traity users, whether privately or publicly (e.g., by sending a
private message on Traity, following them, or enabling you to post on another
Traity user’s proﬁle, e.g., through a public message, comparative anonymous
feedback of personality), to connect with other users who share similar
characteristics, like Personality type, or working for similar companies, and to
invite a friend to join Traity (e.g., by email, a Facebook wall post, or through a
Facebook notiﬁcation). When you initiate a communication through Traity, we
may list your name as the sender of the message, but we will not include your
personal email address without your consent or ability to remove such email
address. Traity, however, enables other users who already know your email
address (or other information about you) to ﬁnd and contact you on Traity using
that contact information that they already have about you. When you invite a
friend to join Traity, the invitation may contain information about other users your
friend might know.
</p>
<p>
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our Services,
Traity also often conducts academic and commercial research on its customer
demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and
other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed
on an aggregate basis, and Traity may share this aggregate data with its
afﬁliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not
identify you personally. Traity may also disclose aggregated user statistics in
order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and
to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
<p>
By using our Services you are consenting to our processing of your Information
and data as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended. As used herein,
"processing" includes, but is not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, combining
and disclosing information.
</p>
<h3>5. How We Share Information</h3>
<p>
We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal identiﬁable information to
third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. We share
your information (which may include Personal Information and Usage Information) with third parties (not Traity) with your consent, as disclosed in this
privacy policy or at the time you provide us with information, and in the following
circumstances:
</p>
<p>
As a service uniquely linked to the Facebook API, Traity will disclose your
Personal Information to Facebook when you have chosen to share your Traity
activity with Facebook (e.g., your Traity activity stream and professional
updates). Once information is shared with Facebook, that information will
become subject to two separate policies: Facebook’s data use policy (and/or any
other applicable policy of Facebook), with respect to the information held by
Facebook, and this Privacy Policy, with respect to the information held by Traity.
Traity is not responsible for, and may be unable to, alter or delete information
after it has been provided to Facebook pursuant to your authorization. If you do
not wish for Facebook to receive your activity stream or professional updates
from Traity, you should not agree to share your Traity activity with Facebook and
adjust your Facebook and/or BranchOut settings to prevent this sharing. By
default Traity does not request the permission to post on Facebook on your
behalf.
</p>
<p>
You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or
marketing offers from one or more third parties. If you agree at that time to have
your information shared, your information will be disclosed to that third party (or
parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and,
if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third
party, you will need to contact that third party directly. You also may request,
sometimes through your use of an interactive feature, a widget or third party
application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will
typically do so under those circumstances.
</p>
<p>
In order to generally provide our services to our users free of charge, we offer
special services to Enterprise Users to help recruiters, sales professionals and
other customers ﬁnd qualiﬁed candidates, business partners, and sales leads,
and to collect market intelligence and aggregate business information. Enterprise
Users will have access to view your Traity Proﬁle as if they were a Connection.
Enterprise Users will also be able to view your responses to certain polls,
quizzes, and surveys, including your personality reports that you answer on the
Traity Services and your personality traits feedback provided by your contacts if
your proﬁle has been set as public on the Account Settings. Enterprise Users will also be able to contact you by sending you a Traity message to qualify you for
business and career opportunities, request Introductions to your network, and
collaborate with you on business opportunities, as well as for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the
services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host the Traity
Site, send out email updates about Traity, remove repetitive information from our
user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including
sponsored links). If you purchase any products or services from BranchOut, our
billing partner will receive billing and ﬁnancial information (e.g., credit card
numbers) necessary to process your charges, including your postal and e-mail
addresses, depending on your payment method.
</p>
<p>
We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as with a sales
customer relationship management service or recruiting software service. If you
use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service.
However, we will identify the partner before you use that service.
</p>
<p>
We may transfer and disclose information, including Personal Information and
Usage Information, to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we
believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental
authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce our Terms of
Services or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise
to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, users of the
Traity Services or the public. We may also use device identiﬁers to identify users,
and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers,
wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. Such
disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
Traity reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including
personal information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation,
restructuring, bankruptcy, the sale of certain stock and/or assets, or other
corporate change including, without limitation, during the course of any due
diligence process.
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”)
that may require registration. If you choose to participate in a Promotion, your
personal information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection,
prize fulﬁllment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. By entering a
Promotion, you are agreeing to the ofﬁcial rules that govern that Promotion,
which may contain speciﬁc requirements of you, including, except where
prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name,
voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.
In addition, Traity partners may access our application programming interfaces
("APIs") in order to search people by skills, proﬁle or personality strengths, for
example, to offer job opportunities that ﬁt with your personality, only if your proﬁle
is set to public.
We may share non-personal information, such as aggregated user statistics with
third parties for a variety of purposes, in our sole discretion. But we only do so in
such a way that no individual user is speciﬁcally identiﬁed or linked to any
speciﬁc action or information.
</p>
<h3>6. Third Party Analytics Providers And Ad Servers</h3>
<p>
Although the Traity Site currently does not display ads from third parties, Traity
works with network advertisers, ad agencies, third party trafﬁc measurement
services and other vendors to provide us with information regarding trafﬁc on the
Traity Site and through the Traity Services, to serve our advertisements on other
web sites, within third party applications, and across the Internet, and to provide
us with information regarding the use of the Traity Services and the effectiveness
of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a Traity advertisement, our
service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and
where you were viewing the advertisement. In connection with providing analytics
and advertisement services, our service providers may collect certain information
about your visits to this or other web sites. We do not share personal information
with these service providers, but they may set and access their own tracking
technologies on your computer or device (including cookies and web beacons)
and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you (such as your
general interest in career networking and Usage Information). Cookies and web
beacons, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to,
among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same
advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the
usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information
about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and
other vendors for similar purposes. While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, you may wish to visit the
NAI, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising
Initiative (“NAI”) members, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.
</p>
<h3>7. How to Access and Update Your Information</h3>
<p>
To manage the information Traity receives about you from Facebook, you will
need to follow the instructions in your “Account” and “Privacy Settings” on
Facebook (or similar features as determined by Facebook) for updating your
information and changing your privacy settings.
</p>
<p>
Once Traity receives your information from Facebook, that information is stored
and used by Traity in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).
While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our

transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized

take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account

hacked, this may lead to unauthorized use of your Traity application, so be
careful to keep your account information secure.
