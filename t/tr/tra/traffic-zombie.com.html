    <p><br>
        <strong>4. THE TYPE  OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU.</strong><br>
        Like most places on the  Internet, simply by visiting our website you automatically tell us certain  information. This includes basic information such as your IP address, when you  visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting us, the website  where you go when you leave our website, your computer's operating system, and  the type of web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records  this basic information about you.</p>
    <p> And like many other  websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our  website's server transfers to your computer. This information can be used to  track your session on our website. Cookies may also be used to customize our  website content for you as an individual. If you are using one of the common  Internet web browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when  you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.</p>
    <p> We may also collect any  data that you provide us by posting it at our website or by e-mail. You can  always choose not to provide us with information. However, if you do withhold  information, we may deny you access to some or all of our website's services  and features.</p>
    <p> Some transactions between  you and our website may involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks,  money orders, and/or third party online payment services.
