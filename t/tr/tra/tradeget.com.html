            <div class="hadingmain">Privacy Statement </div>
            <div class="matter"> Tradeget respects our clients right to privacy
            online. We hold detailed client information in confidence. <br>
             <br>
            <b>Asking for your information </b><br>
             We will sometimes ask clients for personal information such as you
            name, address, e-mail address, occupation, hobbies and other
            details. Providing us your information will simply help us offer
            products and services that we think you'd like to hear about. When
            you choose to give personal information to us over the Internet that
            we or our business partners may request, we will endeavor to inform
            you how we will use the information.<br>
             <br>
             When we ask for personal information for any reason, we will
            provide a link to this policy statement to make our intentions
            clear.<br>
             <br>
            <b>Personal Information Privacy</b><br>
            <strong>Tradeget</strong> will take all appropriate steps to keep
            your personal information confidential. Those steps include limiting
            access to client information databases, communicating this policy
            statement to all Tradeget employees and establishing and enforcing
            penalties for violating this statement. .<br>
             <br>
            <strong>Tradeget</strong> will not sell, rent, or give away our
            clients' personal information to other companies for them to use in
            selling others' products or services. When we do contract with
            another company to market or advertise products or services for us,
            we will insist on binding agreements from those companies protecting
            our client information. We will vigorously enforce all privacy
            agreements we have with other companies. .<br>
             <br>
             We gather personal information from our clients so we can better
            develop our relationship with those clients. Occasionally, we seek
            client comments on our products and services. These comments allow
            us to determine which products and services our clients should be
            made aware of based on their specific needs. .<br>
             <br>
             We will communicate with clients via e-mail or other online
            delivery devices only if the client agrees to receive those
            communications. Clients, who believe they are receiving our
            communications in error or no longer desire to receive them, should
            inform us and we will remove those clients' names from our mailing
            lists. Tradeget will be judicious in the use of e-mail and paper
            mail to communicate with clients. We will, at all times, put
            ourselves in the place of the recipients of our mail and treat our
            clients as we ourselves would like to be treated. .<br>
             <br>
            <strong>Tradeget</strong> has teamed with others to provide our
            clients with enhanced Internet services. In providing such services,
            our business partners also may request personal information from our
            clients. We prohibit these business partners from selling or giving
            away our client information and we require them to have a posted
            Privacy Policy, so that our clients may review it before providing
            personal information to our business partners. .<br>
             <br>
            <b>Cookies</b><br>
            <strong>Tradeget</strong> currently uses a "cookie" on
            our site. No cookies are placed on the user's computer. A cookie is
            placed on our server for as long as the session is active. No data
            from the user's computer is accessed from our site. .<br>
             <br>
             Our cookies tag each visitor's browser with a random, unique
            number. The cookie simply assigns a number and does not disclose any
            personal information about the person using the browser. By noting
            where these uniquely numbered browsers go on our site, we can study
            traffic patterns and improve our site. .<br>
             <br>
            <b>Contact Us</b><br>
             If you have any comments on this policy, please contact us mail.
            We'll investigate and take any appropriate actions to ensure this
            policy is followed. .<br>
