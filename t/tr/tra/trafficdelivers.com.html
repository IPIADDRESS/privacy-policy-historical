Privacy Policy</span></b><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: navy;"><br>
<br>
<b>General</b><br>
At TrafficDelivers, we respect the privacy of our customers and
affiliates and we've created this privacy statement so that you have
easy access to information about our privacy practices. In general,
TrafficDelivers does not collect, store, use or disclose personally
identifying information except in very specific instances, such as, for
example, when you enroll as an advertiser with us. Whenever we collect
such information, you will have a choice regarding whether to provide
it, how it will be used, and to whom it will be disclosed. The
instances in which TrafficDelivers.com does collect and use information
are specifically described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>Information we request, and how we use it</b><br>
In several areas during sign up we ask you to provide certain
information by filling out and submitting an online form. We ask for
your name, address and contact information so we can send you your
order or payments, and so we can contact you if we have a question
about your order/account. Any credit card information that may be asked
for would only be so we can fulfill your order when/if you have placed
one, and so we can provide this information to the company or companies
who process your credit card payment. We do not share or sell your
personal information, including email addresses.<br>
<br>
<b>Information we do not collect</b><br>
When you visit our site, we do not collect your name, email address or
any other personal information unless you provide it to us.<br>
<br>
<b>How we use email</b><br>
After you join our site, you will receive an email confirmation of your
account signup. You will then have to verify your signup to ensure that
your email address has not been given to us by another party.
Occasionally, we send a TrafficDelivers Newsletter to our member
database, our email update on specials, upgrades, partnerships etc and
also paid advertising from fellow members. You may unsubscribe at any
time by logging into your account and deleting your account.<br>
<br>
<b>Information we do not share with others</b><br>
TrafficDelivers does not share, sell or trade email addresses,
information collected as part of a survey or specific details about you
or your household. We do not contribute to or participate in shared or
cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your
personal information. We do not release credit card or financial
information for use by other companies. For privacy purposes, all
information relating to our customers is stored on our highly secure
server, and all credit card information is stored in an encrypted
format.<br>
<br>
<b>Links to Other Sites</b><br>
TrafficDelivers provides links to many other websites that are beyond
our control. Websites that we link to may have privacy and security
policies that differ from those of TrafficDelivers. Please understand
that we are not responsible, in any manner, for the privacy, security
practices, or content of such websites.<br>
