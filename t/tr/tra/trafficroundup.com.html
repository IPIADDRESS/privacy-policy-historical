<b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A 
NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</span></b></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It is 
the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act.&nbsp; Various 
provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act.&nbsp; In 
summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all 
visitors.&nbsp; This is not usually personally identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a 
product or service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the 
purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website 
to collect and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit 
and/or transfer that personal information to third parties.&nbsp; There is no way you 
can modify this information and you have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms of 
the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information 
about our database.&nbsp; In the event that the website, under advice of counsel 
agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit whatever 
information is demanded by the website in order to insure that the website is 
releasing information to the correct party.&nbsp; Other provisions of the OPPA may 
exempt this website from complying.&nbsp; While we take measures to ensure that 
outside parties do not have access to any information we have about you, we do 
not warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have 
access to your information.&nbsp; (You should know that merchant service providers do 
not allow us access to your credit card information.)&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also 
is subject to change without notice.&nbsp; You are required to read it prior to using 
the website.&nbsp; By interacting with the website you agree to the terms and 
conditions of the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By using the website or purchasing a product 
through this website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems 
to address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration 
Association located in a city and county specified herein.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">ABOUT THE 
PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</span></b></p>

<p align="justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">This website 
routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and 
customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</span></p>

<p align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">VISITOR, 
SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</span></b></p>

<p align="justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Registration 
means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive 
steps to communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or 
'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it 
can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting 
information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining 
an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be 
from ordering a product.
<br><br>
Occasionally 
complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a 
fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing.&nbsp; This 
information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to 
anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication 
with the customer.</span></p>

<p align="center">
<b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">ONLINE 
ORDERING</span></b></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Online 
ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services 
supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides 
information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; 
In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, 
state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, 
occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should consider all this information 
available to the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver the product, but 
under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation 
purposes.</span></p>

<p align="center">
<b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</span></b></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Website 
visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:<br><br> 
1) they give their permission for contact by the website;<br>
2) they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the <a href="http://www.clicksagogo.com/terms.php" target="_blank" title="ClicksAGoGo terms of use"><b><u><font color="#000000">Terms of Use</font></u></b></a>, <a href="http://www.clicksagogo.com/purchaseagreement.php" target="_blank" title="ClicksAGoGo purchase agreement"><b><u><font color="#000000">Purchase Agreement</font></u></b></a>,
