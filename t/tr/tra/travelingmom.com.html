This information is gathered automatically and stored in log files, and include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br><br>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.<br><br>Age Policy.<br><br>This Web site is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. WE do not knowingly solict or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children. If you are a parent or become aware of a child registered under the age of 13, please notify travelingmom™ at webmaster@travelingmom.com or as provided at the end of this policy.<br><br>Note to Parents.<br><br>If your child is under 13 and has become a travelingmom™ member using a false age, please notify us as provided at the end of this policy and we will immediately close the account and nullify all personally identifiable information provided by them. If your child is under the age of 18 and you would like to know more about our site, information practices, stored information on your child, or how to close your child’s account, please contact us at webmaster@travelingmom.com or as provided at the end of this policy.<br><br>Cookies<br><br>Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than travelingmom affiliates and contractors who assist travelingmom in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.<br><br>We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. [See http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;278835 for more information about removing cookies from your computer.] We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.<br><br>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. [See "Third Party Advertisers."] This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by travelingmom.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br><br>Registration<br><br>There are some portions of this Web site where you will be required to complete a registration form and/or create a username and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, fax number, or e-mail address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.<br><br>Travelingmom™ is the sole owner of information collected on travelingmom.com.<br><br>Orders<br><br>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.

If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).<br><br>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an e mail newsletter.<br><br>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.<br><br>Tell-A-Friend<br><br>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Travelingmom™ stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.<br><br>Your friend may contact us at webmaster@travelingmom.com to request that we remove this information from our database.<br><br>Communications from the Site<br><br>Special Offers and Updates. We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions.
