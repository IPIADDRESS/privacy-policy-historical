  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
  privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our 
  users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
  what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance 
  with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, 
  we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different 
  from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users 
  will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
  manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, 
  or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will 
  their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make 
  any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information 
  already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site 
  notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will 
  also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying 
  them of the changes in our privacy practices. <br>
