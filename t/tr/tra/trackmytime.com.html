This privacy 
statement covers the site www.TrackMyTime.com.&nbsp; Because this Web site wants to 
demonstrate its commitment to our users’ privacy, it has agreed to disclose its 
information practices.<br>
<br>
If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should 
contact Avilin, LLC at 1-866-4AVILIN or email to 
<a href="mailto:info@trackmytime.com">info@trackmytime.com</a>.<br>
<b><br>
Information Collection<br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Avilin, LLC is the sole owner of the information 
collected on www.TrackMyTime.com. Avilin, LLC collects information from our 
users at several different points on our Web site.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 700"><br>
<br>
Registration</span><br>
In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form.&nbsp; 
During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name 
and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services 
on our site for which he has expressed interest.&nbsp; Users are required to 
provide unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but may or may not 
provide other contact information.<br>
<br>
We request 
information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact 
information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial 
information (such as credit card number, expiration date).&nbsp; This information is 
used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.&nbsp; If we have trouble 
processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.
&nbsp;
Information Use
&nbsp;
Profile<span style="layout-grid-mode: line"><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400">We store information that we collect through 
cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our 
users.&nbsp; A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users 
that details their viewing preferences.&nbsp; Consequently, collected 
information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide 
offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to 
tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing 
promotions to them.&nbsp; We do not share your profile with other third parties.<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<b>Cookies<br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s 
computer tied to information about the user.&nbsp; We use both session ID cookies and 
persistent cookies.&nbsp; For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, 
the cookie simply terminates.&nbsp; A persistent cookie is a small text file stored 
on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can 
be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.&nbsp;</span> By 
setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more 
than once, thereby saving time while on our site.&nbsp; If users reject the 
cookie, they may still use our site.&nbsp; The only drawback to this is that the 
user will be need to sign on each time they visit the site.&nbsp; Persistent 
cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the 
experience on our site.&nbsp; See the “Profile” section.<b><br>
<br>
Log Files<br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Like most standard Web site servers we use log 
files.&nbsp; This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, 
internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time 
stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s 
movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for 
aggregate use.<br>
<br>
</span>
<b>Communications 
from the Site<br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a 
strictly service related announcement.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is 
temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.&nbsp; 
Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications.&nbsp; However, these 
communications are not promotional in nature.<br>
<br>
</span>
<b>Customer Service</b><span style="font-weight: 700"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">We communicate with 
users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues 
relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the 
user’s wishes.<br>
<br>
</span>
<b>Sharing</b><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
Though we make every effort to preserve user 
privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law 
wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with 
a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web 
site.<br>
<br>
</span><b>Third Party Intermediaries<br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">We use a credit card processing company to bill 
users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use 
personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
<br>
</span><b>Business Transitions<br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">In the event Avilin, LLC goes through a business 
transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a 
portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be 
part of the assets transferred.&nbsp; Users will be notified via prominent notice on 
our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their 
personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ 
personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that 
stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our 
notification of changes section.<br>
<br>
</span>
<b>Links<br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">This Web site contains links to other sites. 
Please be aware that we, Avilin, LLC, are not responsible for the privacy 
practices of such other sites.&nbsp; We encourage our users to be aware when they 
leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site 
that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy statement 
applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br>
<br>
</span>
<b>Security</b><span style="layout-grid-mode: line"><b><br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">This Web site takes every precaution to protect 
our users’ information.&nbsp; When users submit sensitive information via the Web 
site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</span></span>

<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">When our registration/order form asks users 
to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social 
security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best 
encryption software in the industry - SSL.&nbsp; While on a secure page, such as our 
order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape 
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to 
un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.<br>
<br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect 
sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
user-information off-line.&nbsp; All of our users’ information, not just the 
sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.&nbsp; Only 
employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to 
personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Our employees must use password-protected 
screen-savers when they leave their desk.&nbsp; When they return, they must re-enter 
their password to re-gain access to user information.&nbsp; Furthermore, ALL 
employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.&nbsp; Any time 
new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the 
importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ 
information is protected.&nbsp; Finally, the servers that store personally 
identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.<br>
<br>
If users have any questions about the 
security at our Web site, users can send an email to 
<a href="mailto:info@trackmytime.com">info@trackmytime.com</a>.<b><br>
<br>
Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</b></span><b><br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">If a user’s personally identifiable information 
changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no 
longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or 
delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually 
be done at the [member information page]<b> </b>or by emailing our Customer 
Support at info@trackmytime.com<b>.</b>&nbsp; Or, contact us by telephone or postal 
mail at the contact information listed below.<br>
<br>
</span>
<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">
<b>Notification of Changes</b></span><b><br>
</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we 
will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other 
places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we 
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; 
We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the 
information was collected.&nbsp; </span>
If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a 
manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users 
via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
information in this different manner.&nbsp; However, if users have opted out of 
all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they 
will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new 
manner.&nbsp; In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy 
practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we 
will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In 
some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to 
receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy 
practices.<span style="layout-grid-mode: line" <br=""><b><br>
