            functionality of the Service.</p>

        <p>We use commercially reasonable means to keep your information strictly confidential. However, your
            information will be shared with other parties in the following situations:</p>

        <p>1. Information regarding Your Websites (including its URL, its category and other similar information) will
            be made available to other users of the Service for the purposes of selling traffic to Your Website or
            buying traffic from Your Website, as the case may be.<br>
            2. We may provide certain information required for fund transfers (either to us or from us) to third-party
            payment processors depending on the method of transfer you choose.<br>
            3. In the circumstances described below under "Disclosures of Information."</p>

        <p>We may use your e-mail or other personal information for non-marketing or administrative purposes, including

        <p>Please note that, as with any other content placed on the Internet, any content on Your Websites which you
            link to on the Service may be viewed by other users of the Service and you are responsible for such

        <p id="cookies"><strong>Additional Information Regarding Cookies</strong></p>

        <p>We use cookies on the Service to track your activity on the website, to enable certain features and to

        <p>We have provided below a list of cookies and similar technologies that we use on the Service, including
            cookies from third parties. Though we will endeavor to keep this list up to date, due to the nature of
            changing technologies on the internet and our inability to control third-party cookies directly, please note
            that the list may not be 100% current. If you do not wish for these and any other cookies to track you, we
            recommend that you use an internet browser which will allow you to disable them.</p>

            directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our
            site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>

        <p>When you use the Service, you may encounter two types of cookies, "first party" cookies that are ours and

            the Service to enhance it.</p>

        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>

        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a
            credit card number or bank account number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that
            information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

        <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
            transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
            storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Any information or
            content you transmit to us is done at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on our Web
