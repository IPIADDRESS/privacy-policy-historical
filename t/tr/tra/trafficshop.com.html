            <p><strong>General Data Usage</strong></p>

            <p>We may use the information you give us to provide you with certain features and to create a personalized experience on the Service. We may also use that information to operate, maintain and improve features and functionality of the Service.</p>

            <p>We use commercially reasonable means to keep your information strictly confidential. However, your information will be shared with other parties in the following situations:</p>

            <p>1. 	Information regarding Your Websites (including its URL, its category and other similar information) will be made available to other users of the     Service for the purposes of selling traffic to Your Website or buying traffic from Your Website, as the case may be.<br>
                2. 	We may provide certain information required for fund transfers (either to us or from us) to third-party payment processors depending on the method     of transfer you choose.<br>

            <p>Please note that, as with any other content placed on the Internet, any content on Your Websites which you link to on the Service may be viewed by other users of the Service and you are responsible for such content.</p>

            <p id="cookies"><strong>Additional Information Regarding Cookies</strong></p>

We use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to store information so that you will not have to re-enter it on future visits, provide personalized content and information, monitor the effectiveness of the Service and monitor aggregate metrics such as the number of visitors and page views.</p>

            <p>We have provided below a list of cookies and similar technologies that we use on the Service, including cookies from third parties.

            <p>When you use the Service, you may encounter two types of cookies, "first party" cookies that are ours and "third party" cookies which are found in other companies' internet tools which are used in conjunction with the Service to enhance it.</p>
