							<h3>Travelzoo's Privacy Practices&nbsp;</h3>
							<p>
							Travelzoo Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 
							firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering 
							and dissemination practices for Travelzoo's Media Products.</p><p>Travelzoo publishes 
								various e-mail newsletters. Users can sign up for newsletters from our home 
								page by providing their first name, e-mail address, and zip code. This 
								information will not be shared with third parties. Recipients can edit their 
								personal information or manage newsletter subscriptions by visiting the <a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/profiles">
									edit profile</a>
							page. Information on how to unsubscribe is also included in every newsletter.
							</p><p>
							Travelzoo may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. The 
							cookie is a small text file that resides on your hard drive. It may be used to 
							retrieve stored information that you knowingly provided us such as name, e-mail 
							address and zip code in order to personalize your use of Travelzoo's Media 
							Products.
							</p><p>Some Travelzoo advertisers may use “view-through” pixels to track the 
								effectiveness of the promotions they run on Travelzoo. Such pixels may lead to 
								cookies being placed on your computer by these advertisers.&nbsp;Travelzoo does 
								not have access to any personally identifiable information about you as a 
								result of these cookies.
							</p>
							<p>
							Travelzoo may track individual user response (clicks) on offers on its Media 
							Products. This information may be used to better customize content and 
							advertising for you in the future. Individual user click behavior is not shared 
							with third parties.
							</p><p>Travelzoo reserves the right to send you certain communications relating to Travelzoo’s service or 
								products, including administrative messages, market research surveys, and periodic 
								product announcements associated with your newsletter or e-mail product 
								subscription(s), as long as you remain a subscriber to one of our newsletters 
								or e-mail products. Your voluntary response to market research surveys may be 
								used to improve our products and services and for anonymous, aggregate 
								reporting for internal and external clients.</p>
							<p>
							   From time to time Travelzoo 
      may announce voluntary promotional programs which may include 
      promotional incentives for subscribers. These programs may 
      require personally identifiable information (ex: name, mailing address or frequent 
      flyer account numbers) to be submitted for those subscribers who wish 
      to participate. This information may be shared, upon the explicit opt-in 
      of the subscriber, with external&nbsp;third parties for the purpose of fulfilling 
      the promotional components of the program, for example with an airline for the 
      awarding of frequent flyer miles to a subscriber’s account. Subscribers who 
      do not wish this information to be disclosed to&nbsp;third parties may 
      decline participation in these optional programs. Any promotional program 
      which includes the sharing of information with a&nbsp;third party will have such a 
      disclosure clearly described in the program’s description and rules.
