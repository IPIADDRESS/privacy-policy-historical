<p align="center"><font color="red" face="Impact, Sans-Serif" size="5">PRIVACY POLICY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">TravelMagma.Com
strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet
technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this
privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address
to any unauthorized third party. Period.</font></p><b>

<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">How we gather information from users</font></p></b>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">How we collect and store
information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in
which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example,
you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information
when you participate in message boards and
chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web
sites, TravelMagma.com also collects information automatically and
through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our
visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service
Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user
name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt
additional technology, we may also gather information through other
means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept
cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of
the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and
we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your
preferences.</font></p><b>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">What we do with the information we collect</font></p></b>

<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">Like other Web publishers,
we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more
individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do
not share your information with anyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">Aggregated Information
(information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many
ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns
with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our
site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what
features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally
be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this
information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information
about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">We may use Personally
Identifiable Information collected on TravelMagma.com to
communicate with you about your registration and customization
preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by TravelMagma.com and other topics we think you
might find of interest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">Personally Identifiable
Information collected by TravelMagma.com may also be used for
other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, and other communications with you. Certain
third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.
We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell,
buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We
may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at
other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,
in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
disclosure in such cases.</font></p><b>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</font></p></b>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">TravelMagma.com
expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy
of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to
our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a TravelMagma.com page, certain content that is actually created or
hosted by a third party. Also, through TravelMagma.com you may be
introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,
contests offered by other parties. TravelMagma.com
is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties.
You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">While on our site, our
advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use
cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that
enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular
advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer
services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other
technology to gather information. TravelMagma.com does not control
the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting
information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such
third parties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">You should also be aware
that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on
message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed
publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our
knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals
or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
TravelMagma.com and this policy.</font></p><b>

<p><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif" size="2">Children</font></p></b>
