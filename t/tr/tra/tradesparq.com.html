            <div class="privacy_policy_content">
            	If you register to use Tradesparq we collect and store information that specifically identifies you or your account ("Personally Identifiable Information"). At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is information about whether you are a “buyer”, “seller”, or “service provider”, your name, password, and email address. Persons wishing to pay for banner advertisements or preferred search listings are also required to enter a valid credit card number and name as it appears on the credit card or other information such as bank routing and account numbers to facilitate ACH payments. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you, to help us to tailor the site for you and deliver personalized information to you. We may supplement our information with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes. Credit card information and any bank information will be transmitted via SSL encryption for your protection.

            <div class="privacy_policy_content">
            	Periodically, Tradesparq conducts online User surveys to collect information about our Users, their preferences and work habits. These surveys are optional and if you choose to respond, your responses will be kept anonymous. Similarly, we may offer contests to qualifying Users in which we ask for contact and demographic information such as name, email address and mailing address. None of this information is shared with third parties, except in summary form, if at all. The demographic information that Tradesparq collects in the registration process and through online surveys is used to help us improve the Tradesparq site to meet the needs and preferences of our Users. This may include targeting advertising or other information to you about our offerings. Information we gather through a contest may also be disclosed to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering.

If you make use of this service, the payment system will collect your credit card number and/or other entered financial institution information and will use that information to bill you any fees and/or to perform the billing operation on behalf of the Provider, including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation.

Tradesparq uses cookies to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track User trends and patterns. Users always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our site may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. As an automatic process, our web server software records a log file of IP addresses that access the Tradesparq site. We also collect IP address information but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users' Personally Identifiable Information, other than for statistical analysis as needed. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our various policies or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

Tradesparq may share your Personally Identifiable Information, including User ID and password, with certain co-branded third-party service or product Providers as required to provide a specific product or service. However, these third-party partners may not use this Personally Identifiable Information for any reason other than to provide the service or product that the User has explicitly signed up for. While it is Tradesparq's general policy not to share anything other than summarized or aggregated data with the partner, any Personally Identifiable Information you provide may also be received by the co-branded site and could be stored and used by the co-branded service or product Provider according to their privacy policy. Please take the time to review these third-party privacy policies.

            <div class="privacy_policy_content">
            	Tradesparq uses an outside credit card processing company to bill Users for Services. Tradesparq may also engage other third party intermediaries in order to provide our users with additional offerings and services. Tradesparq makes no representations on these third parties and their use of personal identifiable information. Please refer to the third party’s website and terms of service for their specific privacy policies.
            </div>
