    Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be

    <br>
    KIDS: If you are under 13 years old, you should not submit any information to us without
    the consent of your parent or guardian. Always ask your parents for permission before
    sending any information about yourself to us - or anyone else - over the Internet. Never
    buy anything online without permission and don't forget to have your parents read this
    page. <br>
    <br>
    PARENT/GUARDIAN: We strive to provide a safe online environment. However, to ensure the
    safety of your children and to monitor their activities, we encourage you to get involved
    when your kids go online, so you can be aware of what they are doing. We will not
    knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of
    age. We do not market via our website or by direct marketing to children under 13 years of
    age. <br>

    Information We Collect: <br>
    <br>
    Personally Identifiable Information<br>
    <br>
    In order to use certain features on our site, we will ask you to register. When you
    register, we collect personally identifiable information about you: your name, mailing
    address, e-mail address, user name and password, (and your phone number if you are using
    our auction services), and any other demographic information, such as income, age,
    schooling, you may have provided to us. In addition to registration, at other times we may
    ask you for personal information, including when you enter a sweepstakes or contest; when
    you enter an order or make a purchase; when you complete a survey; and when you report a
    problem with our site. We use this information to help us to make our sites more useful to
    you. <br>
    <br>
    Our site will offer promotions by marketing partners. You will also be asked for personal
    information if you choose to participate in a program offered on our site by one of our
    marketing partners or an advertiser. You will know when a promotion on our site involves a
    marketing partner because that will always be disclosed. For instance, if you choose to
    participate in a sweepstakes promotion offered on our site, our co-sponsor will collect
    personal information from you from the entry form. The co-sponsors identity will be
    disclosed in the sweepstakes rules. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not
    apply to these third party promotions and you should read their Privacy Policy before
    participating. When you use our website, we also collect your IP address, browser type,
    domain name and access time, and keep records of this information. This information does
    not identify you personally, it is collected for aggregate only reporting on site activity
    used by us and our advertisers. For example, we may use this information to determine
    average visit length, unique visitors, and aggregate browser reports.<br>
    <br>
    When you post on message boards or discussion groups, you grant Meredith Corporation
    unrestricted use of that material, including your name and hometown. Please see our Terms
    of Agreement for more information. Users should be aware that personal information
    voluntarily disclosed on message boards and discussion groups can be collected and used by
    others and may result in unsolicited messages to you from other parties. <br>
    <br>
    Cookies To help our site serve your needs better, we use cookies to store and sometimes
    track information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a
    web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies assign a unique number that
    resides on your computer. Cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password so
    you do not have to give us that information each time you visit our site. Cookies also
    allow us to make sure you do not see the same advertising over and over again. Advertisers
    on our site may use their own cookies. Although it is possible to decline cookies through
    your browser, you will experience difficulty viewing our site if you do so. <br>
    <br>
    How Your Information Will Be Used: Our primary goal in collecting personal information is
    to provide you with a customized experience of our network of websites. We will e-mail you
    with messages and advertising which we think will be of interest to you. We will not
    disclose your e-mail address to any third party for their use, except to complete bidding
    transactions as part of our auction services. If you do not wish to receive e-mail
    messages and promotions from us click <a href="http://www.home-and-family.com/registration/optout.html">here</a> to fill out the
    appropriate form. Whenever possible, we try to ensure that the banner advertising we
    deliver to you corresponds to your interests. The advertiser never has access to your
    e-mail address.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Please note that partaking in some online activities
    will disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as when you
    include your name and e-mail address in a message posting or when you order merchandise in
    the Shopping area. In these cases, your choice to disclose personally identifiable
    information is voluntary. Meredith Corporation may provide personal information to the
    extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in legal
    proceedings where such information is relevant. We may also disclose account information
    in cases where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
    identify, contact or investigate or bring legal action against someone who may be
    violating our Visitor Agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with our
    rights or property, our other website users and their<br>
    rights or property, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. <br>
    <br>
    Third Parties: We may share your personal information, with the exclusion of your e-mail
    address, with other companies that want to send marketing information to our customers. If
    we find that they offer products that we feel may be of interest to you we will allow it.
    If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send your name and complete address to
    Circulation Department, Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa
    50309-3023. When you make a purchase at our website or from a merchant linked to our site,
    the information you give, such as your credit card number and credit information is
    provided to the merchant to enable the transaction to take place. Merchants linked on our
    website have separate privacy and information collection practices from our Privacy
    Policy. <br>
    <br>
    Promotions that run on our site may be sponsored by companies other than Meredith
    Corporation or may be co-sponsored by Meredith and another company. You will know when
    this happens because our co-sponsor will be identified in the promotion or in the rules if
    it is a contest or sweepstakes. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be
    shared with a sponsor and used by that sponsor for marketing. Many promotions offer
    opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more
    information, you give us permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsors
    so they can fulfill your request. You can decide not to participate in a promotion if you
    don't want your data to be collected and used for marketing purposes. Please be aware that
    advertisements, including banner ads, and websites that have links on our site, may
    collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those
    advertisers or websites linked to our site are not covered by this privacy policy. <br>
    <br>
    Aggregated Information: We aggregate information on the user base for our site and share
    this with our advertisers. Of course, none of this information identifies you personally.
    We use this information to identify the most popular features on our sites and help our
    advertisers understand our audience. We also share aggregate information with our
    advertisers to make sure you get ads that are relevant to you. However, in these
    situations we do not disclose to these companies any information that could be used to
    personally identify you. From time to time, we may disclose aggregated information about
    our site to third parties, such as advertisers or business partners.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Security and Passwords: The personally identifiable
    information we collect is stored within our controlled database and we use standard,
    industry-wide procedures, such as firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for credit card
    information. As effective as our security measures may be, no data transmission over the
    Internet can be guaranteed complete security. When you register on our site, you will
    select a password. You will need your password to gain access to your personal
    information. <br>

    Use</a>. Please read them carefully before registering at our website. <br>

    time without prior notice. </font></p>
