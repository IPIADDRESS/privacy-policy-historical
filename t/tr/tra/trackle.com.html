While you will still be able to use the Trackle Services if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Trackle Services may not function as effectively.</p>

<p>Since the foregoing information may be collected when you are signed into the Trackle Services, this information may be associated by us with Personal Information that we have collected from you.</p>
