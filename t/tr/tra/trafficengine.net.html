<p>Traffic Engine, Inc.(TE) is committed to protecting your privacy. This  Privacy Policy explains the type of information TE collects through its  website and what TE does with it. Please read the following privacy  policy carefully before using the TE website. If you use the TE  website, you will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. This  policy may change from time to time so you should check it frequently.  TE does not attempt to determine the identity of any TE user by  analyzing Web usage paths. </p>
<p>If you are visiting TRAFFIC ENGINE.COM and you search the  internet from the website, we collect the following information: your  Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which may include a domain name; the  name of and information about any advertisement that brought you to the  TE website; searches you perform, links you click on; and computer and  connection information such as browser type and version, operating  system, and platform.

<p>TE analyzes its logs of usage path collected from users to  determine Web usage and shopping patterns of users in the aggregate.</p>
<p>If you e-mail TE, we may store copies of such e-mail or similar  communications between you and TE. This can result in the collection of  your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information you  may have in your e-mail text, addresses, or other fields, as well as  the collection of the your IP address, the Internet or other routing of  your communication, and the date and time of your communication. We do  not attempt to correlate this information to your TE cookie number or  your usage and shopping paths unless responding to your inquiry  requires us to do so.</p>

<p>All transmissions between you and TE, including e-mails,  URLs, cookie identification numbers, usage paths, and any personally  identifiable information they might contain, pass through many third  party machines, operating systems, programs, browsers, Web servers,  networks, routers, Ethernet switches, ISPs, proxy servers, intranets,  the public telephone systems, or other devices, any of which may create  activity logs containing such transmissions.</p>

<p>How does TE share the information it collects?  TE does not attempt to determine the identity of its users or correlate  their e-mail addresses with their Web usage paths. Except as described  below, TE does not intentionally disclose personally identifying  information collected from any user to any third party without the  user's consent.</p>
<p>We do not use your cookies or usage paths to attempt to determine your  identity. We use IP addresses to diagnose problems with our servers and  to administer our website. Your IP address also is used by TE to gather  broad demographic information, such as your general geographic location  and Internet Service Provider. IP addresses are further used to help  determine the number of TE users. This demographic information may also  be used by TE to analyze aggregate Web usage behavior.</p>
<p>We disclose any information we possess in response to  subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements, and such information  might be used by the receiving party to determine your identity, your  Web usage or other things about you. We generally do not inform users  of such requests for information, although we might try to do so in  some cases.</p>

We generally do not inform users  of such requests for information, although we might try to do so in  some cases.</p>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform  functions on our behalf, such as technical support services. To perform  those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to TE 's  databases and servers, which may contain personally identifying  information about users. They may not use such access or information  for any purpose other than that for which they are retained.</p>
<p>In the event that TE or substantially all of its assets  are sold or acquired, all information collected by TE would be  transferred to the acquiring party. In any such transfer, however, such  information would remain subject to any applicable terms and  conditions, including the terms of this Privacy Policy and any  amendment thereto.</p>
<p>TE uses commercially reasonable computer security  safeguards to protect its databases and servers against risks of loss,  unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent  or improper disclosure of data. These risks, however, cannot be  completely eliminated and TE therefore cannot guarantee complete  security. TE prohibits its employees from using any of this information  to determine your identity.</p>
<p>No confidentiality for customer feedback.</p>
<p>Feedback and other comments and statements that you chose to submit to  TE by any means whether by e-mail to TE Customer Support, telephone,  letter, or any other means shall be considered non confidential. TE is  free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>Data collection and use practices by other businesses that are not controlled by TE.</p>
<p>The TE website provides links to various features, services, and Web  pages provided solely by our business partners or other organizations.  The links take you to pages provided solely by those entities, although  sometimes the pages are co-branded with the TE logo. You will be able  to tell when another entity is involved with providing features,  services, or Web pages, and any information about your interaction with  those Web pages, including which pages and advertisements you view and  any search terms or other information you enter, will be received by  that other business.</p>
<p>When you click on links to other businesses, those  businesses may attach a cookie to your hard drive and may collect  information about you. TE makes no claims or representations about what  those businesses do or do not collect about you. Please review any  terms of use and privacy policies of those other businesses to learn  about their data collection and data use practices.</p>
<p>Further, our business partners may post advertisements on  pages co-branded with the TE logo. Those advertisements are transmitted  to your browser directly by the advertiser or the business partner, not  by TE, and those advertisers may transmit a cookie to your hard drive  and may collect information about you. If an advertiser or its ad  server has previously placed a cookie on your machine, it may recognize  the cookie and learn you have visited our co-branded Web page or used  our website even though you do not click on the advertisement. TE makes  no claim or representations concerning what such advertisers do or do  not collect about you, and refers you to those entities for information  about their privacy practices.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that TE is not responsible for  any content, advertising, products, or other materials on the websites  (whether co-branded with the TE logo or not) of or available from other  businesses that we do not control. You further acknowledge that TE  shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any  damage or loss caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on  any such content, goods or services available on or through any such  site or resource.</p>
<p>TE does not collect any personally identifiable  information or try to aggregate the different data we might have to  identify an individual, you don't have to worry about changing the  information that we gathered on your usage of our website. If you have  more questions regarding the information that we collect or the way  that we use it, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
