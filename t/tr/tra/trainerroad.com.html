Testimonials and other marketing, promotions and advertisements may include obfuscated Personal Information (such as first name and general location) that you have provided to TrainerRoad.</p>
<p>TrainerRoad may also disclose your Personal Information to a third party as part of a sale of the stock or assets of TrainerRoad, as the result of a proposed or actual change in control of the company, or in connection with any financing of or investment in TrainerRoad by a third party. Any successor or assign of TrainerRoad, including, without limitation, any third party to which TrainerRoad transfers or sells TrainerRoad’s assets or to which the owners of TrainerRoad transfer their equity interests, by any means, will have the right to continue to use your Personal Information as set forth herein.</p>
<p>TrainerRoad may also learn, collect and use certain Non-Personal Information when you register, use or interact with the Site. This Non-Personal Information may include, without limitation, demographic information, or data, information and other metrics regarding the use of and access to the Site. TrainerRoad may also generate Non-Personal Information from the Personal Information we receive, collect, and obtain under this Policy. Once TrainerRoad receives or generates any Non-Personal Information, TrainerRoad may use or share that Non-Personal Information for any lawful purpose without a further duty or obligation to you. This will include, without limitation, developing products and services based on Non-Personal Information, providing those products and services to you or to other third parties, providing targeted marketing or advertising to users, or providing aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Site to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including, without limitation, to prospective advertisers or investors.</p>
<p><i><u>Access to and Protection of Your Personal Information</u></i>. You have a right to access, modify, correct and request that TrainerRoad internally delete any of your Personal Information provided to or obtained by the Site or TrainerRoad. To the extent that such Personal Information cannot be modified or corrected in your user profile by logging into your account and going to the “Edit Profile” page, any other request for access, modification, correction or deletion of your Personal Information, or a part thereof, should be addressed to <a href="mailto:support@TrainerRoad.com"><u>support@TrainerRoad.com</u></a>. If you update, modify or correct any such Personal Information, we may keep copies of your Personal Information prior to such update, modification or correction for uses provided for in this Policy. You may request internal deletion of your Personal Information at any time by contacting TrainerRoad in the manner set forth below, provided that TrainerRoad may retain, use and disclose your Personal Information as set forth in this Policy. TrainerRoad will endeavor to respond to your request in a timely manner. You recognize, acknowledge and agree that the Site and certain products and services of TrainerRoad require Personal Information as a condition to their availability to you, or as part of their functionality, and that to the extent you delete or withhold Personal Information, the Site and other products and services may not be available to you or their functionality may be limited.</p>
<p>Additionally, California residents may request and obtain from TrainerRoad a list of what Personal Information (if any) of such user we disclosed to third parties for that third-party’s direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties by making such request to TrainerRoad at <a href="mailto:support@TrainerRoad.com"><u>support@TrainerRoad.com</u></a>. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. California residents may opt-out of the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for use by such third party in direct marketing by making such request to TrainerRoad at <a href="mailto:support@TrainerRoad.com"><u>support@TrainerRoad.com</u></a>. Please note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes, for purposes of assisting us with our own marketing, or for any other purpose permitted by this Policy.</p>
<p>Residents of Australia may request access to or correction of Personal Information. To access your Personal Information, please contact TrainerRoad at <a href="mailto:support@TrainerRoad.com"><u>support@TrainerRoad.com</u></a>.

TrainerRoad responds to complaints as soon as practicable, and in any event, within the time limits prescribed by law.</p>
<p>Any Personal Information that you provide to TrainerRoad will be protected in a commercially reasonable manner. Although we will take these measures to protect your Personal Information, “perfect security” does not exist, and we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will be secure in all situations. TrainerRoad recommends that you take additional measures to protect yourself and your information, such as installing anti-virus software, closing browsers after use, keeping confidential your log-in credentials and passwords, and making sure that you regularly update software and apps you have downloaded to ensure you have enabled the latest security features on your devices.</p>
<p><u><b>Do Not Track</b></u></p>
<p>We do not track our members over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</p>
<p><u><b>Links to Other Websites</b></u></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Site, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Site to another website, this Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on the Site, are subject to that website's own rules, terms and conditions, and/or policies.</p>
<p><u><b>Children</b></u></p>
<p>The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. TrainerRoad does not intentionally collect any information on the Site from those we actually know are under 13; in fact, registration for and use of the Site by persons under the age of 18 is expressly prohibited. If we become aware that we have collected any information, including without limitation Personal Information, from a person under age 13, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>
<p><u><b>Miscellaneous</b></u></p>
<p>In addition to the Site, this policy also applies to any TrainerRoad mobile applications and any Personal Information or other information that we may collect through such applications.</p>
<p>TrainerRoad reserves the right to revise this Policy at any time without prior notice to you. By using the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by the then-current version of this Policy, and your continued use of the Site reaffirms your agreement to the then-current Policy. You agree to consult the Site regularly for up-to-date information about this Policy. Without limiting the foregoing, TrainerRoad will post any revisions to this Policy on the Site and notify you that a revised Policy has been posted through your electronic mail address contained in your user account.

<p><strong>3. Right to Rectification</strong></p>
<p>You have a right to obtain from TrainerRoad the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Additionally, taking into account the purposes for which TrainerRoad is processing your personal data, you have a right to obtain from TrainerRoad the completion of incomplete personal data concerning you.</p>
<p><strong>4. Right of Erasure</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>A. General Rule</strong>
        <p>You have a right of erasure to obtain from TrainerRoad the erasure of your personal data based on any of the following grounds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your personal data is no longer necessary in connection with the purposes for which TrainerRoad collected or otherwise processed your personal data (subject to the exceptions described in Paragraph 4(B), below);</li>
            <li>TrainerRoad collected or otherwise processed your personal data on the basis of your consent and you have since withdrawn your consent (subject to the exceptions described in Paragraph 4(B), below);</li>
            <li>you have exercised your right to object to processing (discussed below) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for TrainerRoad to continue processing your personal data;</li>
            <li>TrainerRoad has unlawfully processed your personal data;</li>
            <li>compliance with a legal obligation imposed by the EU or the law of any “member state” of the EU (a “Member State”), to which TrainerRoad is subject, requires the erasure of your personal data; or</li>
            <li>TrainerRoad has collected your personal data in relation to the offer of information society services, i.e., an offer for a service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance (the parties are not simultaneously present), by electronic means, and at the individual request of the recipient of the service.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>B. Exceptions</strong>
        <p>Your right to erasure described in Paragraph 4(A), above, does not apply where TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data is necessary for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
            <li>complying with a legal obligation imposed by the EU or any Member State to which TrainerRoad is subject or for carrying out a task in the public interest; or</li>
            <li>establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Right to Restrict Processing</strong></p>
<p>You have a right to restrict TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data if any of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you contest the accuracy of your personal data TrainerRoad is processing, (for a period sufficient to enable TrainerRoad to verify its accuracy);</li>
    <li>TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data is unlawful but you object to the erasure of your personal data;</li>
    <li>your personal data is no longer necessary in connection with the purposes for which TrainerRoad collected or otherwise processed your personal data, but you require your personal data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or</li>
    <li>you have exercised your right to object to processing (discussed below), (pending verification that TrainerRoad has overriding legitimate grounds to process your personal data).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you exercise your right to restrict processing, and if your exercise of said right is valid, then TrainerRoad can store your personal data but cannot otherwise process your personal data without your consent, unless otherwise processing your personal data is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the EU or a Member State.</p>
<p><strong>6. Right to Object to Processing</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>A. Right to Object to Processing Based on Your Particular Situation</strong>
        <p>Where TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal information is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or for legitimate interests pursued by TrainerRoad, you nevertheless have a right to object to TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal information on grounds relating to your particular situation. If you exercise your right to object to processing described in this Paragraph 6(A), TrainerRoad cannot process your personal data unless TrainerRoad demonstrates that it has overriding legitimate grounds to process your personal data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>B. Right to Object to Processing for Direct Marketing Purposes</strong>
        <p>You have a right to object to TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. If you exercise your right to object to processing described in this Paragraph 6(B), TrainerRoad cannot process your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Right to Data Portability</strong></p>
<p>Where TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data is based on your consent or is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or is necessary to take steps requested by you prior to entering into a contract, and where TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data is carried out by automated means, you have a right to data portability. This means that you have a right to receive from TrainerRoad a copy of the personal data you provided to TrainerRoad in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. Additionally, this means that you have a right to require TrainerRoad to transmit directly to a third party the personal data you provided to TrainerRoad, provided that such transmission is technically feasible and provided further that such third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.</p>
<p><strong>8. Right to Withdraw Consent to Processing</strong></p>
<p>Where TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent. However, your withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data prior to your withdrawal of consent.</p>
<p><strong>9. Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority</strong></p>
<p>If you think that TrainerRoad’s processing of your personal data is unlawful or otherwise improper, you have a right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory Authority. A “Supervisory Authority” is an independent public authority established by a Member State pursuant to Article 51 of the GDPR. You should contact the Supervisory Authority established by the Member State of which you are a citizen. If you cannot identify that Supervisory Authority, then you may contact TrainerRoad using the contact information provided in Paragraph 1, above. TrainerRoad will exercise its best efforts to assist you in identifying that Supervisory Authority.</p>
<p><strong>10. Intention to Transmit Your Data to a Third Country</strong></p>
<p>The personal data collected by TrainerRoad is transmitted over the internet. TrainerRoad employs several safeguards to protect the transmission of your personal data. These safeguards include encryption of certain data and other commercially reasonable measures and practices. If you desire more information regarding these safeguards, then you should contact TrainerRoad using the contact information provided in Paragraph 1.</p>
