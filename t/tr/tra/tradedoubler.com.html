<p>&nbsp;</p>

If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy and/or other terms and conditions stated in connection with the collection, please do not provide personal data to Tradedoubler. Tradedoubler reserves the rights not to provide you certain products or services should you choose not to provide required personal data.</p>

<h2>Part 2 - Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting privacy principles</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Tradedoubler processes digital information about Users (web surfers) who visit websites belonging to Clients with whom Tradedoubler has contracted to serve advertisements (the "Advertising Network"). This part of the Privacy Policy lets you know what information we collect and process about you as a User on behalf of our Clients, why we collect it and how it is used in relation to our Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services to our Clients. The Policy contains instructions on how you can display and delete information collected by Tradedoubler yourself and how you can opt-out from further Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities of Tradedoubler. Further, the Policy contains instructions to our publishers on how to notify Users about Tradedoubler's services on their websites.</p>
<h3>What is Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting?</h3>
<p>There exists a range of different kinds of online Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common denomination, you could say that Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more relevant to web surfers' likely interests.</p>
<p>Tradedoubler's Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services are cookie based. "Cookies" are small simple text files (not programs or spyware) stored on the hard drive of a web surfer's computer. Based on the anonymous information stored in the User's cookie, Tradedoubler is able provide more relevant advertising to the User on behalf of our Clients. For example, a User that visits sports sites often will be categorized in the "sports fan" segment, and will primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests of a sports fan, and a User that shows interest in a certain car model or a certain computer model, may be served advertisements or specific offers for such car model or computer model.</p>
<p>The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Tradedoubler's processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow Tradedoubler to trace the User; we do not have, and will not initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to trace the identities of Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information collected at the User's visits to websites belonging to Tradedoubler's Advertising Network. With the exception of a marginal proportion of cookie data saved for statistical purposes solely, a User's cookie can only be viewed by Tradedoubler when the User visits a website that belongs to our Advertising Network.</p>
<h2>Targeting information</h2>
<p><iframe src="http://publisher.tradedoubler.com/public/targetingCookieInformation.action" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>Information stored on cookies</h3>
<p>The cookie information stored on the User's hard drive for Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting purposes is: (i) User segment hits or information on a specific product, service, brand or model in which the User has shown interest during its visit to a certain website (for example a User that visits a sport site of one of Tradedoubler's Clients, will record a hit in the 'sports' segment and a User that has shown interest in a certain car model will record a hit of that car model) and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User profile. The User segments used by Tradedoubler for cookie hits are: (1) Animals; (2) Humanities; (3) Automotive (4) Business; (5) Computers &amp; electronics; (6) Entertainment; (7) Finance; (8) Food &amp; drink; (9) Gaming; (10) Health &amp; beauty; (11) Home &amp; garden; (12) Insurance; (13) Lifestyle &amp; society; (14) News &amp; current events; (15) Reference; (16) Shopping &amp; retail; (17) Social; (18) Sports &amp; recreation; and (19) Telecom &amp; utilities</p>
<h3>If the cookie is deleted by the User, all profile data is removed.</h3>
<p>For the sake of clarity, no segments relating to information which Tradedoubler considers sensitive have been or will be created, such as segments relating to political opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or sexual life. Further, Tradedoubler is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and marketing directed to children. No segments are intended to be established for the profiling of children.</p>
<h3>Use of collected digital data</h3>
<p>Tradedoubler will use the User data in order to better target advertisements on behalf of our Clients, to provide aggregated non-personal reporting to our Clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. The data may be combined with other anonymous information collected from other sources so that we may better serve Users with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share anonymous data between companies within the Tradedoubler group of companies.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Tradedoubler is dedicated to maintain the security of all its data and to prevent unauthorized access through the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, as far as is reasonably possible. Such security measures also include access restrictions, i.e. that data may be accessed only by a limited number of persons within Tradedoubler.</p>
<p>Our employees are made aware of and must comply with Tradedoubler's security measures. When we occasionally use third-party contractors to perform tasks that might otherwise be performed by our employees, these contractors are contractually bound to adhere to this Privacy Policy and they are subject to similar restrictions as our employees.</p>
<h3>Opt-out</h3>
<p>You may at any time easily block further cookie-based Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities from Tradedoubler by opting-out. To do so please follow the instructions above the heading 'Targeting information'.</p>
<p>In addition, note that you are always able to prevent cookies from any website from being installed on your computer by readjusting your browser settings. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you should consult the help section of your browser.</p>
<h3>Publisher notification</h3>
<p>If you are a publisher, please note that you are obligated to notify visitors of your website about third parties who are serving advertisements on your website by way of use of cookies. As party to the publisher agreement with Tradedoubler, you agree to provide clear and unambiguous notice about this. In relation to Tradedoubler's Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting (if you have chosen to be provided with such services), such information shall at least include the following text:</p>
<p>"<em>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In order to do this, our advertising partners may place a cookie (a small text file) on your computer. If you would like more information about this type of targeted advertising, about use of cookies in such practice, and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, click here. For general information about use of cookies on this website, and how to block cookies, please [REFERENCE TO INFORMATION].</em>"</p>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, please note that the foregoing requirement of notification does not limit any of your obligations according to applicable law. You are yourself as a publisher responsible for providing relevant and accurate information required by law, including applicable privacy laws.</p>
