<span class="headline">PRIVACY STATEMENT</span><p>

<b>General</b></p><p>

This privacy statement covers the site www.trails-end.com. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to our users' privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices.

</p><ol>
<li> What personally identifiable information Trail's End collects. </li><li> What personally identifiable information third parties collect through the Web site.
</li><li> What organization collects the information. </li><li> How Trail's End uses the information. </li><li> With whom Trail's End may share user information. </li><li> What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.
</li><li> What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Trail's End control. </li><li> How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </li></ol>

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact the Trail's End Webmaster by email at <a href="mailto:webmaster@trails-end.com">webmaster@trails-end.com</a>.<p>

By using our Web site, users agree to be bound by the terms of the policy. Trail's End collects information from our users at several different points on www.trails-end.com, and this information is used only as described in this policy. The Boy Scouts of America councils ("councils") are affiliated partners in the Trail's End program, and have access to use this information as described below.</p><p>

<br><b>Information Collection</b></p><p>
Registration
</p><ul>
In order to use some of the features of this web site, a user must first complete the registration process by providing personally identifiable information, such as name, address, email or phone number. Users may also be asked to provide certain aggregate information in registration that is anonymous (such as an IP address, income level or gender). User names and passwords are also included in the information that may be requested during registration.
</ul>
Ordering
<ul>
We request further information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and additional financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This sensitive information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. The financial information is not shared with any organization other than Trail's End. Financial information is never shared with the councils. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.
</ul>

<br><b>Information Use</b><p>
General Disclosure
</p><ul>
These are the limited instances in which we will share users' personal information:<p>

</p><ul>
<u>Intermediaries</u>: 
We may disclose users' personal information to third party intermediaries, such as a third party shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies are not allowed to retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any purposes other than those contracted by Trail's End or the councils.<p>

<u>Service Providers</u>: 
We partner with other third parties to provide specific services. For example, in 2003, the prize program for scouts will require an online credited purchase from a third party. When the user signs up for these particular services, we may share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p><p>

<u>Business Partners</u>: 
The system on this Web site exists to support the councils in its popcorn sales program. Information provided to Trail's End will be made available to the councils as needed to run their programs. This includes personally identifiable information, addresses, phone numbers, email, and previous orders. The councils may provide this information to their districts and units for the purposes of annual selling or any other purpose. However, the information provided to the councils does not include any personal financial or credit card information.
</p></ul>
</ul>

Profile
<ul>
We store information that we collect through database files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing permissions. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our web site, and to direct pertinent content. The profile information may be made available to the councils and other third party service providers. 
</ul>

Surveys and Contests
<ul>
From time-to-time our site may request information from users related to surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user, therefore, has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties, other than the councils, unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
</ul>

Legal Use
<ul>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 
</ul>

Communications from the Site or Affiliates
<ul>
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username belong to a valid email address. We and/or our affiliates may send out technical and service-related announcements. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send users an email. We and/or our affiliates communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding account issues. In addition, the councils or related affiliates may send out promotional emails from time to time. 
</ul>

Aggregate Information
<ul>
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and affiliates. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 
</ul>

<br><b>Cookies</b><p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. The user can remove persistent cookies by following the help file instructions included with their browser. </p><p>

<br><b>Log Files</b></p><p>
We use log files including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p><p>

<br><b>Links</b></p><p>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Trail's End and its affiliates are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p><p>

<br><b>Children's Privacy</b></p><p>
We encourage parents and guardians to be aware of and participate in their children's online activities. We strictly adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly register or otherwise collect personally identifiable information from any child. </p><p>

<br><b>Security</b></p><p>
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the industry standard encryption software - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we take additional precautions to protect user-information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to financial information. All Trail's End associates are required to sign an Electronic Mail and Internet policy. This document outlines acceptable use and security policies for all Trail's End computer systems including the Trail's End Web site. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, and the financial information is stored in a separate database with limited system access in a locked facility. </p><p>

<br><b>Correcting and Deleting Personal Information</b></p><p>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the self-edit page or by contacting your council.</p><p>


<br><b>Notification of Changes</b></p><p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases when we post a notice we will also email users notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p><p>
