<li><strong>Bookings and payments</strong> – provide communications about bookings, products and services being provided to you (and others if their personal information is provided by you);</li>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>We may periodically send promotional material to you about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting based on the profile we have created about you to the email addresses and phone numbers which you have provided.</p>
<p>If these are similar to products, services and bookings previously supplied by us to you, we will assume, under our legitimate interests to promote similar goods and services, that you are willing to receive this information unless you tell us otherwise. Please note that we do not want to send you information that you do not want to receive and you can opt out at any time (please see <strong>‘The right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing’</strong> below for further information).</p>
<p>We will always ask your permission before sending you email marketing information (unless your company is a member of Travelodge Business or you have already received similar services, products or bookings from us as mentioned above).  We do this by asking for your positive confirmation (e.g. by providing a tick or inserting your contact details in the relevant boxes) indicating that you wish to receive marketing and you can opt out at any time (please see <strong>‘The right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing’</strong> below for further information). This ensures you only receive information that you have given us permission to send and are willing to receive. </p>
<p>If your company is a member of Travelodge Business we will send electronic marketing messages to the email addresses provided by the member company to promote Travelodge Business and related benefits.  However you will still have the ability to opt out of these messages in accordance with this policy (see <strong>‘The right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing’</strong> below).</p>
<p>We may use your information to create a profile about you in order to tailor, by automated means, our communication and marketing to you. You can object to such profiling, please see ‘The right to object to automated decision making / profiling’ below).</p>
<p>From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for research purposes and / or to ask about your experience using our hotels and services as part of a continual programme of customer service improvement. We may contact you by email, telephone, text, social media and / or mail. We may also use the information to customise the website according to your interests.</p>

<h3>Our approach to information security</h3>
<p>To protect your information, Travelodge has policies and procedures in place to make sure that only authorised personnel can access the information, that information is handled and stored in a secure and sensible manner and all systems that can access the information have proportionate and reasonable security measures in place. To achieve this, employees, contractors, sub-contractors and third party suppliers have contracts, with defined roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>While we take commercially reasonable measures to ensure the safety and security of your data, due to the inherent risks with the Internet, we are unable to warranty the absolute security of your data when using our services.</p>
<h3>Transfers of your information out of the EEA</h3>
<p>We may from time to time need to transfer your personal information to support partners which are located outside the European Economic Area, for the purpose of ensuring our websites are operating correctly or in relation to third parties to whom we share your data. Any transfer of your data will be subject to adequate levels of protection that will safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a security breach.</p>

If you wish to opt out with respect to more than one email address, you must complete a separate request for each email address.</p>
<p>Please note it is not possible to ‘opt-out’ of receiving communication from us which relates to your bookings or customer satisfaction surveys sent as part of the booking (which are not considered marketing for these purposes).

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Travelodge Business Members (Member Companies) are for the purposes of this privacy statement defined as, those companies who have agreed to be bound by the Travelodge Business Terms and Conditions of use of this website.</p>
<p>This website (<a href="https://www.travelodge.co.uk/business">https://www.travelodge.co.uk/business</a>) is operated by Travelodge Hotels Limited ("we", "us" or "Travelodge") and we are a controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679.  We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of all customers, including our Member Companies and those using Travelodge Business.</p>
<p>Travelodge is responsible for, and controls the processing of, the personal information provided to us when Member Companies use this website in accordance with this privacy statement. Please note that when a Member Company shares personal data with us, Travelodge processes such data in the capacity of a Controller. This is because Travelodge has a number of requirements and responsibilities that arise through the booking process such as determining the data needed to book rooms and how long this is kept for. These responsibilities dictate that Travelodge is a controller (rather than acting as a processor on behalf of the Member Companies).</p>
<p>In accepting these terms, Travelodge and Member Companies agree that they will comply with all applicable obligations under data protection legislation and agree to assist each other in complying with their respective obligations under this legislation.</p>
<p>Defined terms used in this statement are as set out in the Travelodge Business Terms and Conditions unless stated otherwise. This privacy statement supplements the terms of the Travelodge Business Terms and Conditions. In the event of any conflict between any term of this privacy statement and the Travelodge Business Terms and Conditions, the Travelodge Business Terms and Conditions shall take priority. All other terms in Travelodge Business Terms and Conditions shall continue to govern use by the Member Companies of the services supplied by Travelodge.</p>
<p>References to personal information provided by Member Companies in this statement shall include personal information of any of the Member Company's staff members, representatives of the Member Company, or guests staying in our hotels using the Member Company's Travelodge Business membership.</p>

This separate privacy policy can be accessed at the bottom of the pages of our careers website.</p>
