<br>
By using our Website, you consent to the  collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with  this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Definitions</u></strong><br>

<br>

<br>
<strong><u>About Us</u></strong><br>
TransUnion  is a credit information and analytics company and a licensed consumer credit  reporting agency operating across Canada. We were formed in 1989 with the goal  of offering the highest quality consumer credit-related products and services  to the Canadian market. Today, we serve both consumers and the business  community by providing consumer and business credit information, fraud and identity  management services and risk management and analytics tools to help our  customers make decisions and to help consumers manage their credit.<br>
<br>
Long  before the federal <em>Personal Information  Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> came into force in 2001, TransUnion  was regulated by provincial consumer reporting legislation designed to protect  the privacy of credit information and to ensure the fairness and accuracy of  credit-reporting systems. Therefore, TransUnion has a long history of commitment  to maintaining and providing accurate and up-to-date credit information and to  safeguarding the credit information in our control.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>An  Overview of Our Business</u></strong><br>
We facilitate  consumer transactions by providing consumer credit information to our customers,  which include banks, credit-card companies, finance companies and other  institutions. By their nature, our services must include some personal  information about consumers. Accordingly, we regularly collect, use and  disclose personal credit information of Canadian consumers. Credit grantors and  other institutions provide TransUnion with factual information about how their  customers pay their bills and other debts. Credit reporting agencies, such as  TransUnion, compile and assemble this information, along with public record  information, into a "file" for each consumer. In return, credit  grantors and authorized institutions, pursuant to the applicable provincial  consumer reporting legislation, are able to obtain credit reports about  consumers. <br>
<br>
We  facilitate commercial transactions by providing business credit information to  our customers.&nbsp; While these services  generally only contain credit information about businesses, certain personal  information may be provided in a business credit report about the principals of  the business, such as name, address, phone number and percentage ownership in  the business.&nbsp; Due to the segregation of  the consumer and business databases, the limited personal information in  business reports does not include the personal credit information of the  principals; customers may separately request a consumer credit report about the  principals of the business. <br>
<br>
<strong><u>Our  Collection Practices </u></strong><br>
We  primarily collect your personal information from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>• reports about you that are provided to us by credit grantors or other  institutions that are responsible for obtaining your consent to provide the  information to us;</li>
<li>• collection agencies;</li>
<li>• directly from you in response to any dealings we have with you; and</li>
<li>• public records, federal and provincial government offices, public  registries, and other sources permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We limit  our collection of personal information to include only what is necessary to  supply our clients with the accurate and up-to-date information they need to  make meaningful decisions and in order to provide our customers or you with the  other services described in this Privacy Policy. We periodically review the  data in our credit-reporting system to ensure that it only contains information  relevant to the services we provide. Furthermore, we ensure that our retention  policies comply with the requirements of privacy laws and provincial consumer  reporting legislation.<br>
<br>
If you  call us, we may record and retain the recording to ensure the accuracy of our  discussions and for quality control and record keeping purposes.<br>
We may use  video surveillance in and around our walk-in locations for the safety of our  customers and employees, and to protect against theft, property damage and  fraud.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Information  We Collect</u></strong></p>

(a)    <strong>What is Included in Our Credit Reports</strong>

<p><strong>Consumer Credit Reports:</strong>&nbsp;TransUnion’s consumer credit reports may contain the following personal  information:</p>
<ul>
<li>• <u>Identifying information</u>: Consumer name, previous name(s), date of birth, Social Insurance  Number (including temporary and/or previous Social Insurance Numbers), current  and previous addresses and telephone numbers, and current and previous  employers;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>• <u>Credit history:</u> Record of payment history on current and previous bills/debt  obligations, including payments on loans, credit cards, lines of credit and  mortgages owing to organizations such as retail stores, banks, finance  companies and telecommunications companies.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>• <u>Public records</u>: Information that may affect creditworthiness, such as judgments,  bankruptcies, consumer proposals and registered items;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>• <u>Inquiries</u>:  A list of credit grantors and other parties authorized by the consumer and/or  by law that have received all or part of a consumer’s credit information.&nbsp; Also lists organizations that have received a  service from TransUnion where consumer credit information was used but not  necessarily disclosed, such as authentication; <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>• <u>Collections: </u>Information about collection matters. This segment may include  information about outstanding collections on business accounts if you are  personally liable for the debt.&nbsp; It may  also include information about outstanding family maintenance support  obligations, if permitted by law;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>• <u>Banking</u>:  Information about bank accounts that were closed by an institution for reasons  such as empty envelope deposit, NSF cheques or uncollected overdraft charges;  and<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>• <u>Remarks:</u>&nbsp; All remarks that have  been added to your file, such as a fraud alert or a consumer statement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business Credit Reports:</strong>&nbsp;  Although TransUnion’s business reports generally only contain credit  information about businesses, they may contain personal information about the  principals of the business such as name, address, phone number and percentage  ownership in the business.&nbsp; </p>
(b) 	<strong>Identification Requirements</strong>
<p>We also  collect other information you have provided to confirm your identity, which we  maintain for quality control and authentication purposes. This information may  include copies of, or information from, your driver's licence, birth  certificate, passport, credit cards, signature, photograph, copies of bills or  correspondence or proof of business ownership. This information is not part of  your credit report.</p>

(c)<strong> Other Information</strong>
<p>We may also  collect: </p>
<ul>
<li>• Contact information, such as your email address, telephone number and  postal address, for the purposes of responding to your inquiries or requests; </li>
<li>• Information necessary to process payments for services that you have  purchased from us, such as your credit card number and expiry date; </li>
<li>• Death records; and</li>
<li>• Information you have reported to us as lost, stolen and/or misused, such  as your Social Insurance Number.</li></ul>
<strong><u>Information We Do Not Collect</u></strong>
<p>TransUnion  credit reports do not contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Medical histories;</li>
<li>• Information about purchases paid in full with cash or cheques; </li>
<li>• Race, creed, colour, ancestry, ethnicity or political affiliations; or</li>
<li>• Information about your chequing or saving account balances, investments  or net worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>While  TransUnion may furnish credit or other scores to its customers based on the  information contained in a consumer or business credit file, the score itself  does not form part of the credit file.&nbsp; TransUnion <u>does not</u> maintain or update scores in individual consumer credit files.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Our  Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information</u></strong><br>
We limit  our use of personal information to those purposes which have been disclosed to the  individual by us or our customers and for which appropriate consents have been  obtained, or for purposes which are otherwise permitted by law. In connection  with our credit reporting services, we do not have direct relationships with  individual consumers or principals.&nbsp;  Accordingly, we require our credit-granting and other customers to  inform individuals of the purposes for which they are providing personal  information to TransUnion, or accessing personal information from TransUnion, and  to obtain appropriate consent at the time the information is collected from the  individual and/or prior to its use or disclosure by TransUnion.&nbsp; We also require our customers to limit the  use of personal information obtained from TransUnion to purposes that are  permitted by law.<br>
<br>
TransUnion  uses and discloses personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>• to provide our consumer credit reporting services, business credit  reporting services, and other related services to our customers; </li>
<li>• to provide fraud detection and monitoring, authentication, ID  verification and/or credit monitoring services to customers purchasing your  credit file; </li>
<li>• to deliver data and products to direct-to-consumer resellers with which  you have contracted directly;</li>
<li>• to provide consumer credit information directly to consumers who have  dealings with us (i.e., who have requested a copy of their credit report), or  to provide services to consumers, such as placing a potential fraud alert on a  consumer’s file; </li>
<li>• to communicate with you regarding services that may be of interest to  you;</li>
<li>• to manage, administer, collect or otherwise enforce accounts;</li>
<li>• if TransUnion was ever sold, or if we merged with another company, or  transferred part or all of our shares or assets, we may disclose and/or  transfer personal information to our successor or assign who may collect, use  and disclose the personal information for substantially the same purposes as  described in this Privacy Policy; </li>
<li>• to assist in the investigation of a contravention of a law and/or  fraudulent activities;</li>
<li>• to fulfill our obligations under consumer reporting and privacy  legislation (such as, a request to initiate an investigation); and</li>
<li>• to act in respect of an emergency that threatens the life, health or  security of an individual or for other purposes as permitted or required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>In  addition, we may provide anonymous information (i.e., information that does not  identify individual consumers or principals) in the form of aggregate or  demographic data to our clients or service providers.&nbsp; We may also generate and use anonymous  information to develop, enhance or validate our products, processes or  services. Personal information will necessarily be used to generate anonymous  information and, when required, to research, validate and test the use of  anonymous information in such processes, products, services and enhancements.<strong></strong><br>
<br>
TransUnion  may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in  providing services and information to our customers and to individual consumers.  In addition, we may engage third parties to assist us with infrastructure  maintenance and support.&nbsp; These service  providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose  other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal  information disclosed by TransUnion and to comply with the general privacy  principles described in this Privacy Policy. Some of these service providers  are located outside of Canada.&nbsp; As a  result, your personal information may be subject to local laws, which may permit  local law enforcement, government or national security authorities to have  access to your personal information in certain circumstances. <br>
<br>
We also  provide a suite of authentication services to assist our customers in  identifying potentially fraudulent transactions. In the course of providing  these services, we may use personal information contained in our credit files  to see if it matches the information that has been provided by an applicant,  typically to credit granting institutions or merchants. When we provide our  authentication services, we typically do not disclose credit information;  instead we use the consumer’s credit file to check the information internally.  While preventing fraud is in everybody’s best interest, these services may  directly benefit consumers if someone is attempting to pose as the consumer by  misappropriating the consumer’s identity and personal credit information. <br>
<br>
<strong><u>Obtaining  Consent</u></strong><br>
<br>
We  collect, use and disclose personal information when the individual is aware of  the purposes for which the information will be used or disclosed, and has given  his or her consent to such use or disclosure, except where collection, use or  disclosure of personal information without consent is permitted or required by  law.<br>
<br>
We will  not, as a condition of the supply of a service, require you to consent to the  collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill  the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is  being provided.&nbsp; For example, you do not  need to consent to receiving communications from TransUnion about services that  may be of interest to you as a condition of receiving a service from us.&nbsp; If you have previously agreed to receive  communications from us and you would like to withdraw your consent, please  contact us in any of the ways noted in the “Contacting Us” section of the Privacy  Policy. <br>
<br>
In most  cases, individuals will not provide such consent directly to TransUnion, but to  our customers. We require our customers to obtain consent prior to providing  TransUnion with personal information, and prior to accessing the personal  information contained in our credit files.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Our  Accountability</u></strong> <br>
We have  appointed both a Compliance Manager and a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee our  compliance with the privacy principles established by the federal <em>Personal Information Protection and  Electronic Documents Act</em>, and with provincial privacy and credit reporting  legislation. However, protecting personal information does not begin and end  there: we are committed to fostering a sense of responsibility amongst our  employees for protecting the privacy and accuracy of personal information while  it is in our care. <br>
<br>
Likewise,  our customers have obligations to individuals when accessing personal  information from us or providing personal information to us. &nbsp;We have processes in place to encourage our customers  to comply with applicable law and obtain the necessary consents. Such processes  include entering into binding agreements with our customers and conducting  random audits of our customers’ internal procedures; however, the  responsibility for customers’ compliance ultimately rests with them.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Our  Safeguarding Practices</u></strong><br>
We take  the protection of personal information seriously. TransUnion has implemented a  security program that is aligned with industry best practices and has appointed  a Security Manager to oversee our security program.&nbsp; We have adopted procedures to secure storage  of personal information and are committed to working with our customers to  protect the security of personal information during any transfer to or from us.  We have also instituted a number of safeguards to identify and prevent the  fraudulent use of personal credit information. TransUnion uses firewall  technology to protect its data from would-be intruders and has implemented  other safeguards to secure information such as passwords, encryption, antivirus  software and physical security measures. Our authorized employees and  representatives will have access to your personal information to the extent  necessary to perform their job functions.<br>
<br>
Fraud  affects us all, which is why we co-operate, to the full extent of our ability  and to the extent permitted by law, with law enforcement officials to identify  and prevent fraud.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Retention of Your Personal Information</u></strong><br>
TransUnion retains your personal information  in our credit information database for as long as necessary to fulfill the  purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. Please  refer to Frequently Asked Questions on the Website for more information about  how long TransUnion retains consumer credit information on file. <br>
<br>
TransUnion may delete personal information  reported about you by a data supplier if our relationship with the data  supplier comes to an end.&nbsp; The end of a  data supplier relationship may impede our ability to maintain a current and  accurate credit file and/or carry out our investigation procedures.&nbsp; We may delete personal information in these  circumstances to ensure that your credit file remains as accurate, complete and  up-to-date as possible.&nbsp; Please review  our website at <a href="http://www.transunion.ca">www.transunion.ca</a> for  additional information.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Access  and Accuracy of Credit Reports</u></strong><br>
As a  consumer reporting agency formed more than 20 years ago, TransUnion has a  mature consumer solutions group that welcomes consumer access and/or correction  requests, and addresses any other questions or concerns. &nbsp;For information on how to request a copy of  your consumer credit file or dispute or update your personal credit information,  please visit the Website.&nbsp; <br>
When  gathering personal information, we work with our customers and data suppliers  to increase their awareness of the importance of providing only personal  information that is accurate and up-to-date. However, TransUnion cannot alter  the information reported by our customers or data suppliers, unless the  information is determined to be wrong, incomplete or otherwise inaccurate. If  you do not agree with the accuracy of the information TransUnion has on file,  we have procedures to ensure that such information is verified, and, where  appropriate, amended or corrected. We also have an established complaint  procedure to address consumer concerns and to ensure any inquiries and  complaints are appropriately investigated and addressed. <br>
If have a  complaint about our personal information handling <u>practices</u> or this  Privacy Policy, please contact us as described below.<br>

<strong><u>Adverse Action</u></strong><br>
When a  customer bases its decision to deny credit to an individual in part on  information received from TransUnion, the customer has a statutory obligation  to inform the individual that it obtained the credit information from us. In  this situation, Customers must provide individuals who are declined credit with  TransUnion’s contact information so that the individual can verify the content  of his credit file and, if necessary, request that information be amended or  deleted.&nbsp; TransUnion does not play a role  in the decision to deny or advance credit, and accordingly, the individual  should deal directly with the institution for more information on the denial of  credit.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Inquiries</u></strong><br>
Inquiries are  a statement of fact to the consumer and other recipients of the consumer credit  file that a TransUnion customer requested information contained in the  consumer’s credit report on a particular date.&nbsp;  Inquiries also provide a phone number for the consumer to contact the  inquiring customer for further information on the pull.&nbsp; By posting inquiries, TransUnion is reporting  certain details about the inquiring customer (such as name and phone number) in  compliance with its obligations under consumer reporting legislation.&nbsp; However, inquiries reveal no information  about the underlying debt or obligation, if any.&nbsp; Please refer to  Frequently Asked Questions on the Website for more information about how long  TransUnion retains inquiries on file. <br>

<strong><u>Protecting  Yourself from Identity Theft</u></strong><br>
Identity theft is one of Canada’s fastest  growing crimes, and one which the victim may not discover until long after  significant damage has been done to his or her credit report. There are a  variety of ways that you could fall victim to this crime, including “phishing”  (seemingly genuine, but forged, e-mails purportedly sent from a reputable  company that require you to provide personal information in a linked website or  risk losing certain benefits from that company), and “Dumpster diving” (where  individuals sort through garbage looking for bank statements, invoices, etc.,  that reveal an individual’s personal information).<br>
<br>
The best way to guard against identity theft  is to learn about this crime in order to identify suspicious activity. Please  visit our Website at <a href="http://www.transunion.ca/">www.transunion.ca</a> for  tips on how to protect yourself. <br>

<strong><u>Cookies</u></strong> <br>
TransUnion's Website makes use of  "per-session" cookies. Unlike "persistent" cookies, which  are stored on a user's hard drive and can last indefinitely, per-session  cookies are stored only in a browser's temporary memory and are deleted when  the browser is shut down.<br>
<br>
When users visit our Website, our web server  offers the user's browser a per-session cookie. As the Website is navigated,  this cookie is read back to our web server, allowing us to generate an  anonymous "click trail" profile of the visit. From the aggregated  information about visits, TransUnion learns how visitors interact with its  Website, how the Website design and content can be improved, and how visitors'  experiences can be improved.<br>
<br>
TransUnion does not link, share or associate  the contents of the per-session cookie with any other information in a way that  would enable the identification of visitors to our Website. Nor do we track or  link together multiple visits by any single user over time. Our per-session  cookies cannot be "read" by any other web servers, so users cannot be  tracked or profiled using TransUnion's cookies if they visit multiple sites on  the Internet.<br>
<br>
Some browsers can be set to reject all  cookies. If a user chooses to modify a browser in this manner, some pages of  our Website may not function properly. <br>
<br>
<strong><u>IP Addresses and Server Logs</u></strong><br>
Unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are  assigned to all Internet users by their Internet Service Providers (ISPs). IP  addresses do not directly identify Internet users; however, through an ISP, an  IP address may be linked to a particular user. <br>
<br>
During a visit to a website, certain  information about a user's traffic patterns, linked with the user's IP address,  is passively and automatically collected in the normal course of establishing  and maintaining a website connection. This information is logged by the web  server of the website that is visited. <br>
<br>
The following information is logged by  TransUnion's web servers during visits to our Website: IP addresses, type of  operating system, time and duration of visit, web pages visited and browser  type. We do not link server log information to any other information in a way  that would enable the identification of visitors to our Website. Server log  information is analysed by us in order to improve our Website and to customize  the Website for users. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be  reviewed for security purposes; for example, to detect unauthorized activity on  our Website. In such cases, server log data, containing IP addresses, would be  shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in  connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Links to Third Party Sites</u></strong><br>
Our Website may offer links to other third  party websites, like TransUnion Interactive, Inc. You should be aware that  operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information and  information generated through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies  when you visit their websites. TransUnion is not responsible for how such third  parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is important  to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before visiting their  websites or providing them with your personal information.<br>
