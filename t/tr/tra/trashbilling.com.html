    <p>This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect
    your personal information.  We may amend this policy at any time by
    posting a revised version on our website.  The revised version will be
    effective at the time we post it.</p>
    
    <h4>How we collect information about you </h4>
    
    <p>When you access the TrashBilling.com website, we collect your IP
    address and standard web log information, such as your browser type
    and the pages you accessed on our website; that information is
    retained in our log files.  We receive your most recent contact
    information and payment history from your hauler.  When making a
    payment or initiating or altering auto-pay we also collect contact
    information (name, address, phone, and email) and financial
    information.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in
    other ways not specifically described here.  For example, we may
    collect information related to your contact with our customer support
    team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p>
    
    <p>Any information we collect about you, your computer, or other
    access devices may be used for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
    
    <h4>How we use cookies</h4>
    
    <p>When you access our website, we may place small data files called
    "cookies" on your computer in order to insure proper and secure
    operation of the website.</p>
    
    <p>We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your
    account.  This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit
    multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't
    need to ask you for your password on each page.  Once you log out or
    close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.</p>
    
    <p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information
    stored in them.  You are free to decline our cookies if your browser
    permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of TrashBilling.com.</p>
    
    <h4>How we protect and store personal information</h4>
    
    <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to
    describe information that can be associated with a specific person and
    can be used to identify that person.  We do not consider personal
    information to include information that has been anonymized so that it
    does not identify a specific user.</p>
    
    <p>If you wish to further secure your account, you may create a
    password of your choosing, which will not be made available to your
    hauler.</p>
    
    <p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in
    the US, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and
    procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and
    state regulations.  We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and
    data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings
    and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for
    those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p>
    
    <h4>How we use the personal information we collect</h4>
    
    <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to
    provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized
    experience. We may use your personal information to:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>provide the services and customer support you request;
    </li><li>process transactions and send notices about your transactions;
    </li><li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
    </li><li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service;
    </li><li>customize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website; or
    </li><li>compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.
    </li></ul>
    
    <p>Neither TrashBilling.com nor its parent companies, subsidiaries, or
    other affiliates will use customer information obtained from
    TrashBilling.com to market products and services, other than
    TrashBilling.com, to you.</p>
    
    <h4>How we share personal information with haulers</h4>
    
    <p>To process your payments, we need to share some of your personal
    information with the hauler that you are paying.  All of your contact
    information and payment history is provided to your hauler.  Credit
    card numbers and bank account routing/account numbers are provided to
    your hauler only in the event that you register for auto-pay services.
    If an attempt to pay your hauler fails, or is later invalidated, we
    may provide your hauler with details of the unsuccessful payment.  To
    facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a user with the
    hauler's address so that questions or issues can be addressed to the
    hauler.</p>
    
    <p>Neither your hauler nor its parent companies, subsidiaries, or
    other affiliates will use customer information obtained through
    TrashBilling.com to market products and services, other than those
    provided by the hauler.</p>
    
    <p>We will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number
    to anyone, except with your express permission (e.g., signing up for
    Auto-pay) or if we are required to do so to comply with federal or
    state law, a subpoena or other legal process.</p>
    
    <h4>How we share personal information with other parties</h4>
    
    <p>We may share your personal information with:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Banking partners, as required by credit card association rules,
    NACHA rules or state or federal laws
    
    </li><li>Companies that we plan to merge with or that acquire
    TrashBilling.com or its parent company (Should such a combination
    occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this
    privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your
    personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will
    receive prior notice.)
    
    </li><li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when 
    	<ul>
    	<li>we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure;
    	</li><li>we need to do so to comply with law; or
    	</li><li>we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal
    	information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial
    	loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate
    	violations of our Terms of Service.
    	</li></ul>
    
    </li><li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
    </li></ul>
    
    <p>TrashBilling.com will not sell or rent any of your personal
    information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only
    shares your personal information with third parties as described in
    this policy.</p>
