    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, located at www.trapster.com (the "Site"). We will notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new policy on this website. Review our Privacy Policy regularly so that you can stay informed of our practices, as they may change in the future.<br>
<br>
By visiting our website, using our services and/or software, or submitting information, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Your assent to these practices is essential for us to provide our services and for our Site to function properly. Similarly, we need you to provide accurate personal information so that you can be identified and/or contacted, and so the validity of the information you provide can be confirmed if necessary. You can opt-out and decide not to provide the requested personal information. However, by doing so, you will not be able to register and/or use the entire Site and/or available services.<br>
<br>
We do not transfer, sell, lease or otherwise share information such as your e-mail address or mobile phone number with third parties, nor have we ever done so.<br>
<br>
The personal information we collect includes your username, valid e-mail address, and optionally your mobile phone number. We use the information that we collect to provide our services and to contact you. Additionally we may contact you on behalf of third parties who offer products and/or services that we believe you would find interesting. For example, we may place advertisements in our newsletter.<br>
<br>
We automatically collect certain information from visitors to, and members of, the Site, such as Internet addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit page, operating system, timestamps, and/or clickstream data. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site so that we can constantly improve the quality of the services we provide.<br>
<br>
If you send personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information in the file that we maintain on you, and other information that we obtain from your use of the services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements.<br>
 <br>
We take measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We carefully limit access to the database in which your personal information is stored.<br>
<br>
We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.<br>
<br>
Contact us at the address below if you want us to change or delete any information that we have about you. We will respond to your request to access, update, or delete your information within ten (10) business days. Before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information, however, we may ask you to verify your identity.<br>
