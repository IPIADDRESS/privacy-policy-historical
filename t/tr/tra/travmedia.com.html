<p>
    Where we need to collect personal data by law or as part of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to provide you with the Services.
</p>
<p>
    Where we have a legal basis to use your personal data without consent (as we have described above), this policy fulfils our duty to process personal data fairly and lawfully and in a manner that you would expect given the nature of our relationship with you, by giving you appropriate notice and explanation of the way in which your personal data will be used.
</p>
<p>
    Where consent is required for our use of your personal data as described above, we will request your consent. Typically, we would collect your consent by you performing an action such as ticking the appropriate consent box or otherwise communicating your consent to us (for example, by email or by you providing us with non mandatory information), you consent to our use of that personal data as set out in this policy. For example, we will only process your personal data for marketing purposes if we have your consent to do so.
</p>
<p>
    You can always change your mind about our processing of your personal data. If you change your mind you can update your account settings within the Services, or contact us by email at <a href="mailto:legal@TravMedia.com">legal@TravMedia.com</a>, or in respect of marketing messages you can unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing messages.

</p>
<p>
    You can also manage your preferences by updating / changing the privacy settings of your account.
</p>
<h2>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>
    We may share your personal data with selected third parties in accordance with this policy, including:
    </p><ul>
        <li>
            any member of our group of companies, including our subsidiaries and ultimate holding company;
        </li>
        <li>
            third party who we run events with;
        </li>
        <li>
            service providers (for example, IT services), business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any Contract we enter into with you, but also when providing you with marketing communications;
        </li>
        <li>
            analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of the Website and the Services;
        </li>
        <li>
            government or other law enforcement agencies, in connection with the investigation of unlawful activities or for other legal reasons (this may include your location information);
        </li>
        <li>
            in the event that we sell any business or assets or receive investment into our business, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective buyer or investor;
        </li>
        <li>
            if TravMedia or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us, including your personal data, will be one of the transferred assets; and
        </li>
        <li>
            if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply the Terms and Conditions for the Services or the Website or any other contract between you and us; or to protect the rights, property or safety of TravMedia, our users, and others.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p></p>
<h2>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>
    Your personal data will be transferred to, processed and stored at destinations outside the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”), including countries in which we have offices such as the US and Australia.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. To find out which countries are covered by this, please see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Where there is no adequacy decision by the European Commission in respect of these countries (to the extent that they are outside the EEA), which means they are not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection to your personal data, we will still ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection. We have therefore put in place the following measures to ensure that your personal data is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with EU and UK laws on data protection:
        <ul>
            <li>
                EU-US Privacy Shield; and/or
            </li>
            <li>
                EU standard contractual clauses.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you would like to find out more about these safeguards in respect of processing of your personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@TravMedia.com">legal@TravMedia.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Website and the Services can also be accessed and used worldwide, which means your data may be processed outside the EEA. Please note that the country from which you are accessing personal data may not provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data.</strong>
</p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>
    All information you provide to us is stored on secure severs. We will use appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data.
</p>
<p>
    Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
</p>
<p>
    We maintain (and ensure that anyone we share your personal data with maintains) appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that an appropriate level of security in respect of all personal data we process. Unfortunately the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted via the Website or any of the Services; any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access or inadvertent disclosure.
</p>
<h2>RETAINING PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>
    We will retain the personal data we receive or collect about you for the period reasonably required for us to use it in accordance with this privacy policy or in accordance with our legal rights and obligations. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Unless we inform you otherwise (or you request that we erase your personal data), we will retain your personal data on record for as long as you continue to use the Services. However, if you do not use the Services for 12 months then we will contact you to inform you that your data / account will be deleted within 12 months unless you access your account to stop this process.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you request that we erase your data, we may still need to keep it (please see below) or may keep it in a form that does not identify you. If we are processing your personal data as part of a Contract and you have not agreed that we may use your data for marketing purposes, we will retain your personal data on record for no more than the duration of the Contract and 6 years thereafter.  
</p>
<h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
<p>
    You have the following rights with regard to your personal data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Access.</strong> You have the right to access data we hold about you.  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Rectification or erasure.</strong> You have the right to request that we rectify or delete any personal data that we hold about you (unless we have the legal right to retain it). If you request that we erase any personal data that we require in order to provide the Services to you, you may no longer be able to use it. This right does not extend to non-personal data. It is likely to be necessary for us to retain your personal data to enable us to carry out a Contract with you and your rights under applicable law to request erasure may be limited accordingly. This means your rights under applicable law to request erasure may be limited accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data portability.</strong> You have the right to obtain personal data we hold about you, in a structured, electronic format, and to transmit such data to another data controller if the legal basis for processing such personal data is consent or performance of a contract.  
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Restriction.</strong> You also have the right to restrict us from processing your personal data if the data is inaccurate, the processing is unlawful or we no longer need to your personal data for the purposes for which we hold it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Object / Change of preferences.</strong> You have a right to request that we stop processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party). You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. For example, if you have given your consent to receive updates from us about new products or services, but have changed your mind, you have the ability to opt out from receiving such communications going forward by contacting us using the details provided below or clicking the relevant link in any communications you receive. Please note, if you submit a request for us to stop processing your personal data in a certain way and this type of processing is required in order to facilitate your use of the Services, you will no longer be able to use the Services following your request for us to stop the relevant processing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Complaints.</strong> If for any reason you are not happy with the way that we have handled your personal data, please contact us.  If you are still not happy, you have the right to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Automated decision making.</strong>  We do not currently carry out decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling. If we change our practices to do this in a way which has legal or similarly significant effects on you, you may have the right to object. If this becomes relevant in the future, we will update this policy to provide further information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note that if you ask us to stop processing your personal data in a certain way or erase your personal data, and this type of processing or data is needed to facilitate your use of any of the Services you may not be able to use the Services as you did before.  This does not include your right to object to direct marketing, which can be exercised at any time without restriction. Please allow at least 3 working days for your request to be actioned.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the rights mentioned above do not extend to <strong>non-personal data</strong>.  Please also note that it is likely to be necessary to retain your personal data for the purposes of assessing and verifying data that is submitted and/or held on the Services and to manage the Services, so therefore your rights under applicable law to request erasure may be limited accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    If you would like to exercise any of the rights mentioned above, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:legal@TravMedia.com">legal@TravMedia.com</a>.
