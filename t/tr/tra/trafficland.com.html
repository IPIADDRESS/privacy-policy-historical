        <h3> Privacy Policy </h3>


        <p>TrafficLand.com takes the privacy of our users very seriously. The TrafficLand Company, which owns
            and operates the TrafficLand.com Web site, is dedicated to establishing a trusting relationship with
            its users, based on respect for personal identity and adherence to the highest industry standards
            for information privacy and security. This Privacy Statement addresses what kinds of information we
            collect from our users and how that information is used. By using the TrafficLand.com Web site, you
            agree to be bound by the terms of our Privacy Policy as follows:</p>

        <h4>Types of Information TrafficLand.com Collects</h4>

        <p>In the ongoing operation and upgrading of the TrafficLand.com Web site, the TrafficLand Company,
            which owns and operates TrafficLand.com, collects and tracks certain types of information from all
            Web site visitors. This information is typically viewed in, and analyzed as a group of Web site use
            data for purposes of improving the service offerings and to communicate with our user community.</p>

        <p>TrafficLand.com uses “cookies”, like most other Web sites, on some site pages.
            The information contained in these cookies, such as your User ID and Password or camera preference
            profiles allows users to enter the Web site and access the areas they are interested in more
            quickly.
            You are free to decline acceptance of TrafficLand.com cookies, but this may result in more time
            consuming
            log-in procedures and delays (or even denial of service) to certain Web site features. Use of some
            Web site
            services or requests for more information about upcoming TrafficLand services may require you to
            provide
            certain types of personal information such as, name, address, e-mail address, etc.</p>

        <h4>How TrafficLand Uses Collected Information</h4>

        <p>TrafficLand uses information provided by TrafficLand.com users to improve service value and
            responsiveness to our customers as well as in fulfillment of requests for information or service
            changes.</p>

        <h4>TrafficLand Policy on Sharing Collected Information</h4>

        <p>The TrafficLand Company will not share any information about individual
            Web site users’ specific camera viewing use with third parties.
            The TrafficLand Company will not sell or rent any personal information collected by TrafficLand.com
            to third parties. The TrafficLand Company will however share collected information about
            TrafficLand.com Web site users to comply with a court order or other legal
            process. The TrafficLand company will take all reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of our
            Web site users’ information, when during the course of normal operations, there may be times
            when TrafficLand.com user information is under control of TrafficLand vendors or agents.</p>

        <h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>

        <p>The ads appearing on our Web sites are delivered to users through various third party advertising
            partners. Information about users visits to our Web sites, such as number of times they have viewed
            an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on
            the sites. Third party advertising partners do not have access to personally identifiable
            information.</p>

        <h4>Security</h4>

        <p>The TrafficLand Company takes every precaution to protect its user’s information.
            When users submit sensitive information via the company’s Web sites, that information is
            protected both online and offline.</p>

        <p>When our registration / order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card
            number),
            that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry.
            While on a secure page, such as our paid subscription sign-up form, the lock icon (that appears on
            most Web browsers)
            becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ”surfing”.</p>

        <p>TrafficLand also employs security measures to protect user information off-line. All of our users’
            information,
            not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who
            need the information to perform
            a specific job (for example, our billing personnel or a customer service representative) are granted
            access to personally identifiable
            information. The servers that store personally identifiable information are located in a secure
            environment.</p>

        <h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>

        <p>TrafficLand.com will have links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy
            practices of any site that may have links to TrafficLand.com.</p>

        <h4>Privacy Statement Updates</h4>

        <p>TrafficLand, Inc. and TrafficLand.com reserve the right to update, revise or make changes to our
            Privacy Policy at any time, without notice, and will update this Privacy Statement as needed to
            reflect changes in our services or business practices.</p>
