        Commitment to Your Privacy: TradeStation Securities, Inc. ("TradeStation") 
        is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of information 
        it collects about its customers. We will not share nonpublic information 
        about you ("Information") with third parties outside of our 
        clearing firm(s) without your consent, except for the specific purposes 
        described below. This notice describes the Information we may gather and 
        the circumstances under which we may share it. Our clearing firm(s) should 
        have an additional separate privacy policy, which explains their privacy 
        practices.</span></p>
      <p><span class="superscriptbold">Why We Collect and How We Use Information:</span><span class="superscript"> 
        We limit the collection and use of Information to the minimum we require 
        to deliver  service to you. Such service includes processing transactions 
        requested by you and administering our business. </span> </p>
      <p><span class="superscriptbold">How We Gather Information:</span><span class="superscript"> 
        We get most Information directly from you, when you apply for, access 
        and use financial products and services offered by TradeStation and its 
        business partnersâ€”whether in person, by telephone or electronically. 
        We may verify this information or get additional information from consumer 
        reporting agencies or public sources. This Information may relate to your 
        finances, employment, avocations or other personal characteristics, as 
        well as transactions and interactions with us, our affiliates, or others.</span></p>
      <p><span class="superscriptbold">How We Protect Information:</span> <span class="superscript">Our 
        employees are required to protect the confidentiality of Information and 
        to comply with our established policies. They may access Information only 
        when there is an appropriate reason to do so, such as to administer our 
        products or services. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural 
        safeguards to protect Information which comply with all applicable laws. 
        Employees who violate our Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary process.</span></p>
      <p><span class="superscriptbold">Disclosure of Information:</span> <span class="superscript">We 
        do not disclose any nonpublic information about our customers or former 
        customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. We may disclose any Information 
        to or as directed by our clearing firm(s) or when we believe it necessary 
        for the conduct of our business, or where disclosure is required or permitted 
        by law. Information may be disclosed for audit or research purposes, to 
        attorneys or other professionals, or to law enforcement and regulatory 
        agencies, for example, to help us prevent fraud. In addition, we may disclose 
        Information to affiliated and non-affiliated third party service providers 
        (i) to enable them to provide business services for us or our clearing 
        firm, such as performing computer related or data maintenance or processing 
        services, (ii) to facilitate the processing of transactions requested 
        by you, (iii) to assist us in offering products and services to you or 
        to assist our clearing firm in offering products and services to you, 
        or (iv) for credit review and reporting purposes. Except in those specific, 
        limited situations, without your consent we will not make any disclosures 
        of Information to other companies who may want to sell their products 
        or services to you. For example, we do not sell customer lists and we 
        will not sell your name to a catalogue company. It is TradeStation's policy 
        to require all third parties, other than our clearing firm(s) and affiliates, 
        that are to receive any Information to sign strict confidentiality agreements.</span></p>
      <p><span class="superscriptbold">Former Customers:</span> <span class="superscript">Even 
        if you are no longer a customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply 
        to you.</span></p>
      <p><span class="superscriptbold">To Whom This Policy Applies:</span> <span class="superscript">This 
        Privacy Policy applies to products or services provided by TradeStation 
        to its customers. </span></p>
      <p><span class="superscript"><strong>Access to and Correction of Information:</strong> If you desire 
          to review any file we may maintain for your personal Information, please 
          contact us. If you notify us that any Information is incorrect, we will 
          review it. If we agree, we will correct our records. If we do not agree, 
          you may submit a short statement of dispute, which we will include in 
          future disclosures of the disputed Information. Information collected 
          in connection with, or in anticipation of, any claim or legal proceeding 
          will not be made available.</span></p>
      <p><span class="superscriptbold">Further Information: </span><span class="superscript">We 
        reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy. The examples contained 
        within this Privacy Policy are illustrations and they are not intended 
        to be exclusive. This notice complies with  federal 
        law and SEC regulations regarding privacy. You may have additional 
        rights under other foreign or domestic laws that may apply to you. </span></p>
