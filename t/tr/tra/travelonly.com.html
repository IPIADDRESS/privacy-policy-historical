                                Cookies <br>
                                A cookie is a piece of data – typically 
                                encoded information about how and when you use 
                                a site – that a Web server creates when 
                                you visit a Web site. This data is placed on your 
                                computer hard drive in the form of a small text 
                                file. <br>
                                There are two types of cookies: session cookies 
                                and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used 
                                only for the length of time you stay on the Web 
                                site. When you leave the site, they expire and 
                                are no longer active. Persistent cookies are more 
                                permanent and can be re-read when you return to 
                                the site that placed them on your computer.</p>

                                To help us serve you better, we continuously and 
                                automatically collect generic, non-personal information 
                                about visits to our Web site. The following points 
                                describe the nature of the information collected 
                                in our Web server logs: <br>
                                We do not collect personal information such as 
                                names, ages, phone numbers, addresses or e-mail 
                                addresses from visitors to our Web site. We do 
                                not collect individual profile information for 
                                visitors across multiple sites and do not aggregate 
                                information from any other sources about browsing 
                                patterns of individual visitors across multiple 
                                sites.</p>
                              <p>We collect anonymous visitor information like 
                                IP addresses, browser types (such as Internet 
                                Explorer or Netscape), return visits from past 
                                guests, referring pages, pages visited along with 
                                the order in which they were visited, time spent 
                                on the Web site, and the referrer and transaction 
                                information for e-commerce pages. We collect such 
                                non-personally identifiable information for the 
                                following purposes: (1) to obtain anonymous statistical 
                                analysis of Web page traffic patterns for our 
                                Web site (2) to administer our Web site and servers, 
                                (3) to allow for auditing of our services by third 
                                parties, and (4) to improve our services.</p>
                              <p>As mentioned above, we use cookies only for more 
                                accurate anonymous traffic analysis As we do not 
                                build a database of individual visitors, the data 
                                that we do collect is never stored in any individual 
                                user profile; the data collected serves only to 
                                update aggregate counts allowing us to monitor 
                                traffic on our Web site.</p>
                              <p>We make use of customized JavaScript tracking 
                                code to track anonymous information about visitors' 
                                activity. This code contacts our suppliers’ 
                                servers, receives a cookie in response, and loads 
                                an image to the page. This 1 x 1 image is called 
                                a clear gif or Web bug. This JavaScript tracking 
                                code does not collect personal information such 
                                as name, age, phone number, mailing address or 
                                credit card numbers from visitors to our Web site. 
                                Visitors may elect to opt out of receiving tracking 
                                cookies used to collect information for our Web 
                                server logs. Note: the opt out option requires 
                                one cookie to function.</p>
                              <p>We do not create individual profiles of visitors. 
                                We do not have a database of individual profiles 
                                of each visitor. We collect data in aggregate 
                                form and data is not recorded or stored about 
                                individual visitors.</p>
                              <p>We may use the aggregate data to inform third 
                                parties as to the number of people who have seen 
                                and clicked on links to their Web sites. <br>
