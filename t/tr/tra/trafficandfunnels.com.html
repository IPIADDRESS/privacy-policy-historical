<h2><b>Privacy Policy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective Date: July, 2016</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of </span><b>TRAFFIC AND FUNNELS<sup style="font-size: 50%">TM</sup> LLC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (“we” or “us”). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the </span><b>www.trafficandfunnels.com </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">website (the “Site”), and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</span></p>
<p><b>How We Collect and Use Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site).</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">trafficandfunnels.com only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended one of our events, or have purchased one of our products. trafficandfunnels.com collects personally identifying information from our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address for registration &nbsp;or opt-in purposes and name, postal address, and credit card information when registering for our events or purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors and third-party publishers and advertisers for a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party's website and review its privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site or by emailing messages to you through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.</span></p>
<p><b>Google Analytics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business. Advertiser features include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remarketing with Google Analytics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Display Network Impression Reporting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DoubleClick Platform integrations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</span></li>
