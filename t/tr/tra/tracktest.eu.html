<p><em>This privacy policy is effective from May 25, 2018.</em></p>
<p><em>Key changes from the <a href="https://tracktest.eu/privacy-policy-old/">previous version</a>: Terminology alignment with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and further clarification of differences between the individually registered user and the user registered through the organisation (1.6-1.7)</em></p>
<p>Welcome to TrackTest English proficiency tests (the “Service”) provided by the company Tracktest s.r.o. (“TrackTest”,”us”, “we”, or “our”) via the website <a href="https://tracktest.eu">https://tracktest.eu</a>.<br>
This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.<br>
We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service, accessible from <a href="https://tracktest.eu/tos/">https://tracktest.eu/tos</a></p>
<h2><b>1. Definitions</b></h2>
<h3><b>1.1 Personal Data</b></h3>
<p>Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).</p>
<h3><b>1.2 Usage Data</b></h3>
<p>Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).</p>
<h3><b>1.3 Cookies</b></h3>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a User’s device.</p>
<h3><b>1.4 Data Controller</b></h3>
<p>Data Controller means a person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed.<br>
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your personal data if you are registering as the individual, not through the organisation.</p>
<h3><b>1.5 Data Processor (or Service Providers)</b></h3>
<p>Data Processor (or Service Provider) means any person (other than an employee of the Data Controller) who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.<br>
If you are signing up for the specific&nbsp;organisational account or use the activation code (voucher) provided by the organisation, we are a Data Processor of your personal data on behalf of the organisation. The organisation name and logo are displayed before and after the registration in the prominent locations of the website design.<br>
We may also use the services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively.</p>
<h3><b>1.6 Data Subject</b></h3>
<p>Data Subject is any living individual who is the subject of Personal Data.</p>
<h3><b>1.7 User</b></h3>
<p>The User is the individual using our Service. The User corresponds to the Data Subject, who is the subject of Personal Data. The User can be registered as the individual or as the member of the Organisation.</p>
<h3><b>1.8 Organisation</b></h3>
<p>The Organisation (e.g. School, Company or Reseller) is the administrator of the Service and is responsible for the end-users and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your Organisation administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that Organization’s policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator’s organization, which may be different than this policy.</p>
<p>Even if the Service is not currently administered to you by an organization,&nbsp;if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work or school email address) to access the Service, then the owner of the domain associated with your organizational email address (e.g. your employer or school manager) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. You will be notified if this happens.</p>
<p>Organisation administrators are able to restrict your access to and privileges within the respective account. In some cases, enterprise administrators can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>reset your account password;</li>
<li>restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services or your account;</li>
<li>control your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete account information;</li>
<li>change your account information, including profile information or the email address associated with your account;</li>
<li>access information in and about your account;</li>
<li>access or retain information stored as part of your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information. If you feel your personal data are at risk or misused, contact us and we will facilitate the problem with the Organisation.</p>
