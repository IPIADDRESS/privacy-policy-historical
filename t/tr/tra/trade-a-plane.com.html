										<p>To better protect your privacy, The Cosby Harrison Company and/or our applicable subsidiaries and/or affiliates (collectively, "The Cosby Harrison Company," "us," "our" or "we") provides this Privacy Policy, which explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way in which your information is collected and used on this website or any other website operated by us where this policy appears or is otherwise accessible by you (for instance, via links from the website) (collectively, this "Website"). (Some of our Websites may also be governed by separate or additional private policies.) Please see our Terms and Conditions for additional information applicable to your use of our Website. By providing us with personally identifiable information, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
      You do not have to give us personally identifiable information in order to access and browse our Website. However, while on our Website, you may be able to search, buy, order or bid on products, enter promotions, sweepstakes or other contests, participate in a survey, complete a questionnaire or other "information request" form, or otherwise subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, participate in one of our online forums/communities, express an opinion or communicate with our customer service. In order to utilize, participate in or otherwise access such products, services or other offerings, you may be required to provide us with your personally identifiable information, which is information that, alone or in combination with other information, allows us to identify you, such as your name, address, phone number, e mail address, contact preferences, credit card information, financial information or information relating to a support or service issue. If you provide us with your personally identifiable information, you are giving us permission to use that information for the specific purpose for which it is provided and for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy, which are described in detail below under "How We Use the Information." Users unwilling to provide personally identifiable information online can choose not to provide such information, and in some (but not all) situations users may be able to work with a sales representative or customer service representative to utilize our services or other site offerings without providing personally identifiable information. IN ADDITION, IF YOU DO PROVIDE US WITH YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREVENT US FROM SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES IF YOU WISH, AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER "Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information."
      
      
      
      We also may collect, store and use certain non-personally identifiable information we receive when you visit our Website, and we may aggregate data and information provided by or collected from multiple users (which may include you) in a manner that is not personally identifiable to any individual user. All non-personally identifiable information collected by us on our Website and all aggregated/compilations of data we create are the exclusive property of The Cosby Harrison Company. Nothing in this Privacy Policy limits our right to use any such non-personally identifiable or aggregated information in any way (including, but not limited to, monitoring user traffic patterns, analyzing and quantifying user preferences, improving the design and content of our Website, and enabling us to personalize your user experience) or prohibits us from sharing non-personally identifiable or aggregated information with third parties.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>How We Use the Information</strong><br>
