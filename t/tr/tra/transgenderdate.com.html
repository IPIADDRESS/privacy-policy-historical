Each of these websites should have its own Privacy Policy if it is collecting personal information about you. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.

 <br><br>
<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>6.         How We Use Financial Information</b></span>
 <br><br>
We use your financial information to, if applicable, check your qualifications and to bill you for our service. By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial information, on the Site, you consent to our providing your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine are necessary to support and process your activities and transactions, as well as to your credit card issuer for their purposes. These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process and support the transaction or activity.

 
 <br><br>
<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>7.         Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial Information</b></span>
 <br><br>
Your personal information or financial information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy or to comply with the law or to protect the interests or safety of Transgenderdate.com or other visitors to the Site.

  <br><br>

<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>8.         How We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information</b></span>
 <br><br>
We may review all your demographic information. We may use public information to enable other users to determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the Site and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to Transgenderdate.com's users, so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular Transgenderdate.com users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this Privacy Policy.  
 <br><br>
<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>9.         Our Security Precautions</b></span>
 <br><br>
The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. We encrypt all of your personal and financial information as it travels over the Internet and we store your financial information on our servers in encrypted form. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your country or jurisdiction.

 
 <br><br>
<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>10.       Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</b></span>
 <br><br>
If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the Site. Please note that we will continue to have the right to change our Privacy Policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.
 <br><br>
<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>11.       How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Personal Information and Public Information</b></span>
 <br><br>
We give you the opportunity to modify personal information or demographic information you have provided to us, at anytime. Please be aware that it may take several hours for the changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the Site. Please note that changing or deleting your information, will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future activities on the Site and for managing future communications from Transgenderdate.com. These changes and deletions will not change or delete emails or information that we may have already forwarded to other users or credit card companies or any other third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy.
