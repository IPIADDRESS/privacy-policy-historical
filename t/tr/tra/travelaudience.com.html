<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<div id="content">
<h2>Privacy Policy Pursuant to Section 13 of the German Telemedia Act</h2>
<p>travelaudience GmbH, Elsenstraße 106, 12435 Berlin (hereinafter “travel audience”) respects your private and personal sphere. This privacy policy governs the most important principles of data processing as part of our services.<br>
Apart from visiting our website, you may have also become aware of us through what are known as “retargeting” ad campaigns, which we offer as a service, in other words, through targeted advertising via previously visited promotional offers.<br>
Therefore, as part of this privacy policy, we would like, in addition to presenting the general principles of our data processing (Part 1), also to explain briefly how retargeting works and what data we need and process for that purpose and how you, if you so desire, can ensure that you do not receive such display advertising in the future.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions beyond the information provided below, please feel free to contact us at the address provided at the end of this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Part 1 – General Principles, Data on Our Own Web Presence</h2>

<h3>IP Addresses When Visiting Our Website www.travel audience.com</h3>

<p>When you visit our website and our web server, the IP address of your Internet service provider, the website from which you visit us, the websites that you visit with us, and the date and duration of the visit are stored by default. These data are used by us exclusively for our own purposes, for example, to analyze browsing activity on our own website, so that we can regularly improve our service offered there.</p>

<h3>Special Services (e.g. Newsletters)</h3>

<p>From time to time, we offer special services on our websites, such as registration for newsletters or contact requests. In order for you to be able to use these special services, we collect further data, such as name, email, address, or phone number, if necessary to provide the relevant service. These data are used by us exclusively to provide those special services.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>Our website may also contain links to websites of other providers to whom this privacy policy does not extend.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies on Our Own Sites:</h3>

<p>travel audience uses cookies to be able to follow visitor preferences and design the websites accordingly in an optimal manner.<br>
Cookies are small data files containing text information which our web server sends to the browser of the user. They are merely stored temporarily on the user’s hard drive. They can only be read by the server that also previously stored them and contain information about what you viewed on our website. Internet use can be designed more effectively using cookies. There are two different types of cookies, “session cookies,” which are stored merely while you are visiting the website, and those called “permanent cookies,” which remain stored on your hard drive even after you leave the website. travel audience uses both kinds of cookies depending on the type of service offered.<br>
The use of cookies is governed by an industry standard. Some Internet service providers set them to offer useful functions to their customers. The cookies themselves identify the computer IP address only anonymously and do NOT store ANY personal information, such as the name of the user.</p>

<h3>Use and Disclosure of Personal Data and Designated Use</h3>

<p>The data collected on our websites are used by travel audience exclusively to advise you, to advertise, and to perform market research for our own purposes and to design the services provided by travel audience in line with market demand.<br>
We do not sell or lease any user information. If transmission of your data is necessary for the provision of a service, it will occur only with your consent.<br>
To perform our services, we work together with companies affiliated with us within the meaning of Section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act. These are companies of the Amadeus Group, in particular, TravelTainment GmbH in Würselen and Pixell GmbH in Bonn. Apart from these companies, we do not disclose your user data to third parties. Collection and/or transmission of personal data to governmental institutions and agencies occurs only within the scope of applicable legislation. Our employees and suppliers/partners are subject to confidentiality and data secrecy obligations pursuant to Section 5 of the German Federal Data Protection Act.<br>
You may object to this use at any time without citing reasons.</p>

<h3>Freedom of Information</h3>

<p>On request, travel audience will inform you whether and what personal data is stored with us about you. If this information is incorrect, despite our efforts to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date, we will correct it at your request.</p>

<h3>Data Security</h3>

<p>travel audience uses technical and organizational security measures to guard your data administered by us against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or access by unauthorized third parties. We are constantly improving our security measures as technology evolves.</p>

<h3>Enforcement of and Compliance with this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>travel audience undertakes to comply with the aforementioned points in regard to protection of data privacy, as described.<br>
If you have questions concerning the processing of your personal data, please feel free to contact us. We are available at the address provided below, including for requests for information, suggestions, or complaints.</p>

<h2>Part 2 – Protection of Data Privacy in the Context of Retargeting Marketing Campaigns</h2>

<h3>What is retargeting?</h3>

<p>Retargeting is a term in online marketing that describes a process whereby a website visitor is tagged and then retargeted on another website with a personalized ad. For example, you visit website A and then visit website B, where an ad of website A matching your browsing activity on website A is displayed using our service.</p>

<h3>How does retargeting work and what is stored in cookies?</h3>

<p>The technology used at travel audience is based on what are known as “permanent cookies” as described in Part 1. When you visit the website of one of our partners, anonymous browser cookies are set there. Please keep in mind that, apart from the general information described below, the set cookies contain merely an anonymous user ID. At no time are personal data, such as your name or address, recorded and stored by travel audience as part of retargeting. Nor is your IP address stored for retargeting. This means neither travel audience nor the advertising partners can, for example, learn your identity, age, gender, or occupation using the set cookies.<br>
In addition to the user ID, general information about your browsing activity is stored in the cookie, for example:<br>
- The ID of the publisher where the ad was viewed (always the last one) - the URL at which the ad was last viewed - the ad that the user clicked – the position on which the ad material was clicked - the advertiser that was clicked – whether the mouse moved over the ad previously – the format that was clicked – the ID of the clicked promotion – product information – the country of the user – the closest airport of the user</p>

<h3>Use and Disclosure of the Data Collected as Part of Retargeting</h3>

<p>The data collected in the cookies are used by us exclusively for the purpose of improving our services provided to our advertising customers and as part of retargeting. This means the data are used to display personalized advertising, to settle accounts with our partners for advertising campaigns using our services, to analyze and improve our services, and to analyze the effect of our partners’ advertising campaigns.<br>
Unless necessary for the aforementioned purposes, we do not disclose the collected data to third parties, with the exception of our affiliates. These are companies of the Amadeus Group, in particular, TravelTainment GmbH in Würselen and Pixell GmbH in Bonn. These companies likewise use the data only to improve our services and for no other purpose.</p>

<h3>What rights do I have concerning the data collected as part of retargeting?</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that we cannot link you to the collected data because they are anonymous, we could only provide information about the stored data if the user ID contained in the stored cookie is known to us. Since it generally cannot be guaranteed that you are in fact the individual who generated the information stored in the cookies, we thus generally cannot provide information about the data or accommodate requests to delete them. However, you have the automated capability to ensure that you do not receive display advertising personalized by travel audience through retargeting in the future. We explain how this works below.</p>

<h3>How can I ensure that I do not receive display advertising personalized by travel audience through retargeting?</h3>

<h3>Cookie Settings in the Browser</h3>

<p>First, you can change the cookie settings in your browser so that cookies are no longer stored. You will thus prevent the cookies needed for retargeting from being placed on your computer. To that end, please change the appropriate browser settings. The specific settings can differ depending on the browser used. For Microsoft Internet Explorer, you will find the relevant instructions at http://windows.microsoft.com/de-de/windows-vista/block-or-allow-cookies. For Mozilla Firefox, you will find the relevant instructions at http://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-erlauben-und-ablehnen. If you use another browser, or if the displayed links do not lead to the desired result, then you will generally find further information by entering the name and manufacturer of your browser and the terms “cookies” and “settings” in an Internet search engine.<br>
Please keep in mind that when you block cookies, certain website services that require the processing of cookies (such as certain shopping carts on ecommerce sites) may no longer work.</p>

<h3>Opt-Out</h3>

    <p>
        You may furthermore inform us that you no longer want personalized advertising provided by travel audience by activating the following button icon.<br>
        <br>
        Your current cookie status:<br>
        <img class="gxmbhzsgyuzwluzidmqh pmvrzvuxlvghnglyvnkr" src="http://ads.travelaudience.com/retarget.ashx"><br>
        <a href="http://ads.travelaudience.com/retarget.ashx?optout=1&amp;ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.travelaudience.com%2Ftaresources%2Fprivacy.html">I no longer want to receive any personalized advertising from travel audience.</a><br>
        <a href="http://ads.travelaudience.com/retarget.ashx?optout=0&amp;ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.travelaudience.com%2Ftaresources%2Fprivacy.html%23optout">I would like to receive personalized advertising from travel audience.</a>
    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that in this case we will set a cookie that contains information indicating that you do not wish to receive advertising personalized by travel audience through retargeting. When you have deactivated the acceptance of cookies (see above) in your browser or when you delete the cookies, we will no longer be able to know that you do not want any retargeting. In this case, you will have to reactivate the aforementioned button icon, thereby ensuring that the relevant cookie is permanently stored. The same applies when you use a browser other than the one you are currently using.</p>

<h3>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We may have to update or change this privacy policy from time to time due to changes in services or use of technologies that until now have not been deployed by others. We will then publish this updated version on our website as well as on other appropriate sites. We therefore recommend that you occasionally view the most recent version of the privacy policy on the travel audience website if you would like to know what data we record and how we use them.</p>
