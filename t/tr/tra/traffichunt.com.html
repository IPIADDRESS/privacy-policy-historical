            <p class="terms-content-text"><strong>WebTraffic LLC</strong> doing business as <strong>TrafficHunt</strong> (referred to herein as “TrafficHunt”, “We”, “Us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting consumer privacy and to clearly informing users about the collection and use of information when using our Service.

            <h3 class="terms-content-title">What we collect</h3>
            <p class="terms-content-text">We need to know your basic personal data in order to provide you with Service. We will not collect any personal data from you we do not need in order to provide and oversee this service to you.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text">Three types of data and information are collected by Us or shared with Us:</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text"><strong>Non-personal Information:</strong><br>Which is non-identifying and non-identifiable information, without particular reference to the identity of the user from which such information was collected:
                When you visit our Website, information about your visit (e.g. how you navigate the site) may be collected and stored. This information may include the length of your visit, the date and time of your visit, the pages you look at and the sites you visit before and after leaving our site. It does not include personally-identifiable information such as your name, mailing or email address or telephone number. We use this non-identifiable and aggregate information to better design our website and for the purpose of optimizing our services and/or business. We also may share this general non-identifiable information with our affiliates, suppliers, sponsors and advertisers.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text"><strong>Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong>Which is individually identifiable information that identifies an individual, or may with reasonable effort identify an individual, either alone or in combination with other information, or may be of private or sensitive nature.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text">As part of this voluntary registration, we may request contact information (such as name, mailing address, email address, etc.) and other data required for operating these services. We may only collect personal information from you if you voluntarily provide it. By voluntarily providing this personal information to us, by sending us a comment or suggestion, you will be consenting to the collection, use and distribution of your personal information by us for the purposes set out herein. You are under no obligation to provide us with personal information and may access and enjoy many parts of our website without providing us any personal information.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text"><strong>"Cookie”:</strong>We keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a small entry-in text file, called a "cookie", on your hard drive. A cookie is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. Cookies do not reveal personal information. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself such as email address, purchases and preferences. Cookies cannot read data from your hard drive.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text">The Site may contain electronic images known as “web beacons” which are also sometimes called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies, allow us to count visitors to the Site pages and to deliver services via the Site. We may also include web beacons in email messages in order to determine whether such messages have been opened and acted upon. We do not tie web beacons to any PII you submit while on our Site.</p>

            <h3 class="terms-content-title">Use and sharing of information</h3>
            <p class="terms-content-text">For the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance all the personal data we process is located on servers within the USA. No 3rd parties have access to your personal data unless the law allows them to do so. We have a Data Protection regime in place to oversee the effective and secure processing of your personal data. Your information that you provide us with will be kept with us until you notify us that you no longer wish to participate/benefit from Service. You can easily opt-out by emailing to us via <a href="mailto:info@traffichunt.com">info@traffichunt.com</a>.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text">We reserve the right to use your information: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for general Site administration purposes; (3) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; and (4) as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy. We do not share, sell or trade any of your information with any third parties other than described herein. We may share your information with our principles, officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates, or our subsidiaries’ employees and consultants (collectively “Related Entities”). Neither we nor our Related Entities contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your information.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text">In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information will likely be among the assets transferred. We also reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>

            <h3 class="terms-content-title">Rights to Your Information According to GDPR</h3>
            <p class="terms-content-text">GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which is a European Union law governing privacy and data protection for all residents of the EU. The provisions of GDPR can be also applied to how data is processed and verified (more on that later) outside the European Union.
                Generally speaking, the GDPR represents a new set of rules intended to empower the citizens of the European Union to control their personal information. In accordance with the applicable laws, users are authorized to access and modify their own data held by the companies, which includes data collection, ad tracking, surveys, cookies, location data, and every other bit of a user’s “digital footprint”. Users are also entitled to transmit their personal details to other organizations. The GDPR also enforces companies to determine their in-house data security policies.</p>
            <p class="terms-content-text">At any time through the web interface provided as part of the Services or via contact us page you have the right:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>- to access your personal information that we hold;</li>
                <li>- to request the rectification of your personal information that we hold;</li>
                <li>- to request the erasure of your personal information that we hold;</li>
                <li>- to request to restrict processing of your personal information;</li>
                <li>- to object to processing of your personal information by us;</li>
                <li>- to request to transfer your personal information that we hold (e.g. data portability);</li>
                <li>- to file a complaint to a supervisory authority in your jurisdiction; and</li>
                <li>- to withdraw any consent related to your personal information given by you.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="terms-content-text">We will process your requests to us within 30 days. We will also notify you within and a relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours from a breach related to your personal information that we hold.
                We have assigned a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who may be reached via dpo@traffichunt.com. Our DPO is tasked with ensuring that we acknowledge and abide by our data protection responsibilities.
                We will not store personal information for more than 6 months from the date of your last active session on the Site or for more than 6 months from the date of termination of an agreement between us and you (whichever is earlier).</p>

            <h3 class="terms-content-title">Security</h3>
            <p class="terms-content-text">We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect information from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep information on servers that are protected by firewalls and located in a physically secure facility accessible only to authorized employees of TrafficHunt and the Related Entities. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that, despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable and any information transmitted to us or through the Site will be at your own risk.</p>

            <h3 class="terms-content-title">Intellectual Property</h3>
