			<h1>Our privacy policy</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="document">
			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This privacy policy is for this website trafficcompany.com and governs the privacy of its users who choose to use it.</p>

<p>The policy sets out the different areas where user privacy is concerned and outlines the obligations &amp; requirements of the users, the website and website owners. Furthermore, the way this website processes, stores and protects user data and information will also be detailed within this policy.</p>

<p>Traffic Company is a Data Controller for the purposes of EU General Data Protection Regulations, which are effective 25th May 2018. Our contact details can be found on this website. If you are not happy with any aspect of how we collect and use your data, you have the right to complain to the local supervisory authority for data protection issues. We should be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint, so that we can try to resolve it for you.</p>

<h2>2. What data do we collect about you?</h2>

<p>Personal data means any information capable of identifying an individual. It does not include anonymized data. We may process certain types of personal data about you as follows:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
	<li><span class="strong">Identity Data</span> may include your first name, maiden name, last name, username, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.</li>
	<li><span class="strong">Contact Data</span> may include your billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.</li>
	<li><span class="strong">Financial Data</span> may include your bank account and payment card details.</li>
	<li><span class="strong">Transaction Data</span> may include details about payments between us and other details of purchases made by you.</li>
	<li><span class="strong">Technical Data</span> may include your login data, internet protocol addresses, browser type and version, browser plug-in types and versions, time zone setting and location, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this site.</li>

</ul>

<p>We may also process Aggregated Data from your personal data but this data does not reveal your identity and as such in itself is not personal data. An example of this is where we review your Usage Data to work out the percentage of website users using a specific feature of our site. If we link the Aggregated Data with your personal data so that you can be identified from it, then it is treated as personal data.</p>

<h3>Sensitive Data</h3>

<p>We do not collect any Sensitive Data about you. Sensitive data refers to data that includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data. We do not collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>

<h3>Marketing Communications</h3>

<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
	<li>requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us; or</li>
	<li>if you provided us with your details and ticked the box at the point of entry of your details for us to send you marketing communications; and</li>
	<li>in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
	<br>
	You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:sales@trafficcompany.com">sales@trafficcompany.com</a>.
	<br>
	Where you opt out of receiving our marketing communications, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.
</p>

<h3>Change of Purpose</h3>

<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to find out more about how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email us at <a href="mailto:sales@trafficcompany.com">sales@trafficcompany.com</a>.

</p><p>If we need to use your personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the legal ground of processing. We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law. </p>

<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>

<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above: </p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
	<li>Other companies in our group who provide IT, billing and system administration services and undertake leadership reporting.</li>
	<li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
	<li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
	<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the E.U. and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
	<li>Governmental and non-governmental authorities that manage market Codes of Conduct and customer complaints.</li>
	<li>Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<h2>6. International Transfers</h2>

<p>We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>

<p>
	We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
	<br>
	We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<h2>9. Your Legal Rights</h2>

<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
	<li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
	<li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
	<li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
	<li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
	<li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
	<li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
	<li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see more about these rights at the website of the local privacy authority.</p>

<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at <a href="mailto:sales@trafficcompany.com">sales@trafficcompany.com</a>.</p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
