                that Internet transaction stay private and protected. travelocity.co.uk 
                uses a security protocol called "SSL3".</b> </p>
              <p> <b>What is SSL?</b> <br>
                Recent developments in browser/server technology have made it 
                easy for people to use Web services without worrying about electronic 
                fraud. Two examples are Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) developed by 
                Netscape, and Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP) developed 
                by Terisa Systems, Inc. Both of these security protocols have 
                been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as 
                an Internet-Drafts. Basically, these protocols allow the browser 
                and server ends of a Web session to authenticate one another and 
                secure information which subsequently flows between them. Through 
                the use of cryptographic techniques such as encryption and digital 
                signature, these protocols: </p>
              <p> Allow Web browsers and servers to authenticate each other; Permit 
                Web site owners to control access to particular servers, directories, 
                files or services; Allow sensitive information (e.g., credit card 
                numbers) to be shared between browser and server, yet remain inaccessible 
                to third parties; and Ensure that data exchanged between browser 
                and server cannot be corrupted - accidentally or deliberately 
                - without detection. </p>
              <p> <b>Public key certificates</b> <br>
                A key component in the establishment of secure Web sessions via 
                the SSL or S-HTTP protocols is the public key certificate. Without 
                authentic and trustworthy certificates, protocols like SSL and 
                S-HTTP offer no security at all. </p>
              <p> The credentials used to authenticate Web servers and their clients 
                via protocols such as SSL and S-HTTP are called X.509 public key 
                certificates. A public key certificate is analogous to a passport, 
                in that it proves your identity and is authorized by a trusted 
                third party known in the security world as a Certification Authority 
                or CA (see below). In the passport analogy, the CA is similar 
                to the Passport Office, which verifies your identification, creates 
                a recognized and trusted document which certifies who you are, 
                and issues the document to you. </p>
              <p> <b>CA's and third party trust</b> <br>
                A Certification Authority (CA) is a trusted authority responsible 
                for issuing certificates used to identify a community of individuals, 
                systems or other entities which make use of a computer network. 
              </p>
              <p> By digitally signing the certificates it issues, the CA binds 
                the identity of the certificate owner to the public key within 
                the certificate, and thereby vouches for the trustworthiness of 
                the certificate. Network users possess the CA's own public key 
                certificate (sometimes referred to as the "root key"), and use 
                it to verify others' certificates. In doing so, they have assurance 
                that the public keys in those certificates are the authentic keys 
                of the named subjects, and know that the CA (whom they recognize 
                and trust) vouches for this binding. The CA plays a crucial role 
                in Web security, since the CA makes a third-party trust relationship 
                possible. </p>
              <p> In a large, distributed and complex network such as the Web, 
                the third-party trust model is necessary since there are many 
                permutations of dynamic, client-server relationships. Servers 
                and clients may not have an established mutual trust; yet both 
                parties want to have secure sessions, which demands a foundation 
                of trust. The CA is the missing link which makes trusted Web sessions 
                a reality. Because each party in the session trusts the CA, and 
                because the CA has vouched for each party's identification and 
                trustworthiness by signing their certificates, each party recognizes 
                and has implicit trust in the other, so the secure session can 
                proceed without the risk of masquerading. Further, since the two 
                authenticated parties exchange public key certificates, they can 
                encrypt and digitally sign session data, removing the possibility 
                that others may eavesdrop on the session or tamper with data.
