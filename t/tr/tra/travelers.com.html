<p>The nature of our business requires a relationship of trust with our customers. 
  The foundation of that trust is the assurance that we will not misuse information 
  that we receive about customers. The following is our Privacy Policy regarding 
  the collection and disclosure of our customers’ personal information. The Privacy 
  Policy is subject to updates at any time. The St. Paul Travelers companies operate 
  in a number of different jurisdictions and this Privacy Policy is not a comprehensive 
  statement of all measures taken and rules complied with in each of those jurisdictions, 
  but an indication of the intent of The St. Paul Travelers to comply with the 
  privacy laws of the jurisdictions where we do business.</p>

        and services to customers and to support our business operations. We obtain

    <td width="80%">
      <p>We use procedural, manual and electronic security controls to maintain 
        the confidentiality and integrity of personal information in our possession 
        and guard against its unauthorized access. Some techniques we employ to 
        protect information include locked files, user authentication, encryption, 
        firewall technology and the use of detection software. We are responsible 
        and the use of detection software. We are responsible for identifying 
        information that must be protected, providing an adequate level of protection 
        for that data and granting access to protected data as permitted or required 
        by law.</p>

      <p>Some of The St. Paul Travelers employees have access to customer personal 
        information in the course of doing their jobs, which includes underwriting 
        policies, processing claims, developing new products or advising customers 
        of our products and services. These employees are expected to keep this 
        information in confidence and share the information only with those who 
        have a business reason to know. Employees are prohibited from making unauthorized 
        disclosure of personal information that we obtain about customers. Employees 
        who violate our policies on privacy may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

        information that we have about customers within The St. Paul Travelers

      <p>We may give personal information to other persons or companies to help

        it only for the reasons we gave it to them. To serve our customers and 
        administer our business including the processing of claims, we may share 
        personal information about customers with unaffiliated third parties, 
        including agents, brokers, other insurance companies, reinsurers, regulators, 
        administrators and service providers and as otherwise permitted or required

    <td width="80%">
      <p>The St. Paul Travelers acknowledges that some customers about whom we 
        collect personal information have certain legal rights concerning that 
        information. These individuals have a right to be told of their privacy 
        rights and our information handling practices. They have a right to know 
        what information we have about them, how we obtained it, and with whom 
        we may share it. They also have a right to request correction of any wrong 
        information pertaining to them in our file. The St. Paul Travelers supports 
        these rights as they add a measure of security and confidence to our dealings 
        with the public. We will do everything we reasonably can to assist customers 
        in exercising their privacy rights and will not attempt to dissuade them 
        from doing so.</p>
