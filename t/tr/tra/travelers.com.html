<p><a name="talk"></a><b>WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT "PRIVACY"</b></p>
<p>We are concerned about your privacy. When we issue an insurance policy to an individual, we need information about the person or property that we're insuring. We consider this information private and have taken steps to protect its confidentiality.</p>
<p>We also feel that you, the customer, are entitled to know about our practices regarding personal information - what kinds of information we obtain about you, where we get it, and with whom, if anyone, we may share it.</p>
<p>This brochure describes our privacy policy and related procedures and information practices with respect to individuals who seek or obtain automobile, homeowners and other personal liability and property insurance for personal, family or household needs.</p>
<p></p><center><a href="#top"><img border="0" src="/personal/images/ptop.gif" width="61" height="24"></a></center>

<p><a name="wehave"></a><b>WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WE HAVE AND WHERE WE GET IT</b></p>
<p>You provide us with most information we need in the application process. To make sure all this information is current and correct, we may need to verify it with you by telephone or by mail.</p>
<p>You may be asked to fill out a supplementary questionnaire to give us additional information we need, or to give more details over the phone. In addition, we may receive and verify information on your past insurance claims from insurance support organizations or your former insurers.</p>
<p>As permitted by law, we may also request credit and other consumer reports from consumer reporting agencies in connection with your application for insurance or any renewal of such insurance. Information obtained from a report prepared by an insurance support organization, including consumer reporting agencies may be retained by them and disclosed to other persons.</p>
<p>For Auto Insurance, we routinely obtain a report of accidents or convictions from your State Motor Vehicle Department. We obtain these reports through an independent reporting company. We may also receive and verify other information from government agencies or independent reporting companies to help us correctly rate and properly underwrite your insurance risk.</p>
<p>On insurance for a home, a building, or a boat, we or an inspector from an independent reporting company may visit the property to inspect and report on its condition, and in some cases, take a picture of it. This enables us to verify the estimate we have of your property's insurance replacement value. If we should need a more detailed evaluation of the property or the protection devices you've installed, we may need to conduct an inspection which would require entrance to your property. We would contact you before doing so.</p>
<p>In most states, we also order an Insurance Score based on credit history as part of our underwriting process. We use the Insurance Score, together with the information you provide us and other consumer reports to determine eligibility and the price we will charge for insurance.</p>
<p>Once you're insured with us, your file may also contain information about your dealings with us, which may include your premium payment history or the claims you have had with us. A claim representative may comment, for example, on the condition of the insured property, or let us know if there have been any changes in the way it's used. We may also keep a police report, if there was one in connection with an accident.</p>
<p>We also, occasionally, require some medical information about an insured - if, for example, we need to know whether a physical impairment will affect a person's ability to drive. In such a case, we would ask you to sign a form authorizing your personal physician to give us a statement about your health.</p>
<p></p><center><a href="#top"><img border="0" src="/personal/images/ptop.gif" width="61" height="24"></a></center>

<p><a name="access"></a><b>WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>Information which has been collected about you, which we keep, will be contained in our records. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information in our records.</p>
<p><b>We do not give or sell our customers' personal information to others for marketing purposes. Since we do not share your information outside of permitted exceptions, you don't have to ask us not to share your information.</b></p>
<p>We will refer to and use information about you to issue and service your insurance and settle claims. We may disclose the information to other persons or organizations to assist us to administer or service our business. When we do, we require them to use it only for the purposes we provided it to them.</p>
<p>We may provide, without your prior permission and only if permitted by law, information about you contained in our records and files to certain persons or organizations <u>such as:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Your agent or broker</li>
<li>Our affiliated property and casualty insurance companies</li>
<li>An independent claim adjuster or investigator</li>
<li>Persons or organizations that conduct scientific research, including actuarial or underwriting studies, provided that no individual may be identified in the studies</li>
<li>An insurance support organization, including consumer reporting agencies</li>
<li>Another insurer in order to prevent or prosecute fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, on rare occasions, we may be required to share this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a State Insurance Department or other governmental agency, if required by federal, state or local laws</li>
<li>If ordered by a summons, court order, search warrant or subpoena</li>
