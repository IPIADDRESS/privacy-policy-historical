<div class="avia_textblock "><h1>Collection of Personal Information</h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may choose to give us personal information directly in a variety of circumstances. For example, you may want to give us your name and contact information to communicate with you, to process an order, to provide you with a subscription or a service, or to do business with us if you are a supplier or a business partner. You may also provide your credit card details to buy something from us or may share a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at TradeMotion for which you wish to be considered. If you tell us that you do not want us to use your information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your request, we will respect your request.</p>
<p>We may also collect information relating to your use of our Web sites through the use of various technologies. For example, when you visit our Web sites, we may log certain information that your browser sends us, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect information about the pages you view within our sites and other actions you take while visiting us. In addition, we may also use such technologies to determine whether you’ve opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail. Collecting information in this manner allows us to collect statistics about our Web sites usage and effectiveness and personalize your experience while you are on our Web sites, as well as tailor our interactions with you. For details regarding the technologies we employ, see “Cookies, Web Beacon and Other Technologies” below.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may also collect information that pertains to you indirectly through other sources, such as list vendors. When we do so, we ask the vendors to confirm that the information was legally acquired by the third party, and that we have the right to obtain it from them and use it.</p>
<p>The information that we collect, either directly or indirectly, may be combined to help us improve its overall accuracy and completeness and to help us better tailor our interactions with you.</p>

<div class="avia_textblock "><h1>Use of Personal Information</h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following paragraphs describe in more detail how TradeMotion may use your personal information.</p>
<h3>Fulfilling your Transaction Request</h3>
<p>If you request something from TradeMotion, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, for instance, TradeMotion’s business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, or postal or government authorities, such as Customs authorities, involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
<h3>Personalizing your Experience on our Web Sites</h3>
<p>We may use information we collect about you to provide you with a personalized experience on our Web sites, such as providing you with content in which you may be interested and making navigation on our sites easier.</p>
<h3>Providing Support</h3>
<p>We may use your personal information to support products or services you have obtained from us, such as notifying you of a product update or fix.</p>
<p>We also provide “Live Chat” sessions on our Web sites to assist you while you’re navigating through our sites; we will use personal information you provide via these sessions in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>In the course of providing technical support to you, we may sometimes have incidental access to data that you have provided to us or data that is located on your system. This data may contain information about you, your organization’s employees, customers, partners, or suppliers. This Privacy Statement does not apply to our access to or handling of this information; the conditions regarding the handling and processing of that data is covered by the applicable Terms of Use or other agreements between you and TradeMotion, such as the Terms of Use for Exchanging Diagnostic Data.</p>
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>The information you provide to TradeMotion, as well as the information we have collected about you indirectly, may be used by TradeMotion for marketing purposes. Before we do so, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. You may at any time choose not to receive marketing materials from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each e-mail you may receive, by indicating so when we call you, or by contacting us directly (please refer to “Privacy Questions and Access” below).</p>
<p>Some of our offerings may be co-branded, that is sponsored by both TradeMotion and third parties. If you sign up for these offerings, be aware that your information may also be collected by and shared with those third parties. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies to gain an understanding of the manner in which they will handle information about you.</p>
<p>If you choose to “Email This Page” to a friend or colleague, we will ask for their name and e-mail address. We will automatically send a one-time e-mail sharing the page you indicated, but will not use that information for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Recruitment</h3>
<p>In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on an TradeMotion Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume. We may use this information throughout TradeMotion in order to address your inquiry or consider you for employment purposes. Unless you tell us not to do so, we may keep the information for future consideration.</p>
<h3>Monitoring or Recording of Calls, Chats and Other Interactions</h3>
<p>Certain online transactions may involve you calling us or us calling you. They may also involve online chats. Please be aware that it is TradeMotion’s general practice to monitor and in some cases record such interactions for staff training or quality assurance purposes or to retain evidence of a particular transaction or interaction.</p>
<h3>Use of Information in the Social Computing Environment</h3>
<p>TradeMotion provides social computing tools on some of its Web sites to enable online sharing and collaboration among members who have registered to use them. These include forums, wikis, blogs and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>When registering to use these tools, you will be asked to provide certain personal information. Registration information that is not automatically made available to other participants as part of your profile will be subject to and protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Any other content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any other type of personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is not subject to this Privacy Statement. Rather, such content is subject to the Terms of Use of those platforms, and any additional guidelines and privacy information provided in relation to their use, as well as the process by which you can remove your content from such tools or get help to do so. Please refer to them to better understand yours, TradeMotion’s, and other parties’ rights and obligations with regard to such content. You should be aware that the content you post on any such social computing platforms may be made broadly available to others inside and outside TradeMotion.</p>
<h3>Protect the Rights and Property of TradeMotion and Others</h3>
<p>We may also use or share your information to protect the rights or property of TradeMotion, our business partners, suppliers, clients, or others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or the rights of others, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web sites.</p>
<h3>Information for Business Partners</h3>
<p>If you represent an TradeMotion business partner, you may visit TradeMotion Web sites intended specifically for TradeMotion business partners. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the business partner you represent, and TradeMotion business partners generally. For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of TradeMotion business partner programs. It may also include sharing certain information with other business partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or TradeMotion customers or prospects. In connection with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
<h3>Information for Suppliers</h3>
<p>If you represent an TradeMotion supplier, you may visit TradeMotion Web sites intended specifically for use by TradeMotion suppliers. We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or performing a transaction with you. For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of TradeMotion, TradeMotion’s business partners, customers, shipping companies, financial institutions and postal or government authorities involved in fulfillment. It may also be used to administer and develop our relationship with you, the supplier you represent, and other TradeMotion suppliers generally.</p>

As such, we may share information about you within TradeMotion and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, TradeMotion will still handle your information in the manner described here.</p>
<p>In some cases, TradeMotion uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is TradeMotion’s practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with TradeMotion’s policies.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may disclose information that identifies you at an individual level and which we collected on our Web sites to other non-TradeMotion entities that are not acting as our suppliers, such as our business partners. Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we will only do so with your prior consent. We do not sell or lease such information however.</p>
<p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, TradeMotion decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is TradeMotion’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
<p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of TradeMotion, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its accuracy. TradeMotion implements reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information such as credit card information when we transmit such information over the Internet. We also require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>As mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our Web sites to help us gather statistics about our Web sites usage and effectiveness, personalize your experience on our sites, and tailor our interactions with you.</p>
<p>We do so through the use of various technologies, including one called “cookies”. A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer. While cookies are often only used to measure Web site usage and effectiveness and to allow for ease of navigation or use and as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor’s experience to a Web site by being associated with profile information or user preferences. You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web sites’ features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able, for instance, to add items to your shopping cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Web site services that require you to sign in.</p>
<p>Some TradeMotion Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across TradeMotion’s Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don’t want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages; however, they will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies.</p>
<p>We may also include Web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners set Web beacons and cookies on our site. In addition third-party social media buttons may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring Web site addresses, and, if you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link such collected information with your profile information on that site. We do not control these third party tracking technologies.</p>
