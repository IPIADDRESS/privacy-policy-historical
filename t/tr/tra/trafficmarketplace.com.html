          PRIVACY POLICY        </h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content-full">
        <h6>Effective June 2007</h6>
        <p>This page sets forth the privacy policies and practices of the Traffic  Marketplace ("Traffic Marketplace") corporate site <a href="http://www.trafficmarketplace.com/">www.trafficmarketplace.com</a> ("Traffic Marketplace Site").</p>
        <p> Please read this privacy policy carefully since by visiting this site and  sharing information with Traffic Marketplace you agree to be bound by the terms  and conditions of this Privacy Policy unless you offer different terms which  are accepted by Traffic Marketplace in writing. To the extent there is a  conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and a written agreement to  which Traffic Marketplace is party, the terms of such agreement shall prevail  with respect to the parties to that agreement.<br>
          For more information about Traffic Marketplace and other Connexus companies  please visit <a href="http://www.connexuscorp.com/">www.connexuscorp.com</a>.</p>
        <h6>STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING</h6>
        <p>The Traffic Marketplace information usage practices are based on two  beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and  prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can  provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In  accordance with these beliefs, Traffic Marketplace creates results for  advertisers and publishers in revolutionary ways without compromising  individual privacy.</p>
        <h6>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h6>
        <p>Traffic Marketplace is the corporate entity that manages the Traffic  Marketplace marketing, technology and e-commerce companies and divisions. The  Traffic Marketplace Site is not directed towards individual Internet consumers  nor does it seek any personally identifiable information ("PII") from  such consumers. PII may be collected should a consumer contact Traffic  Marketplace on his/her own accord and volunteer PII. The information collection  practices of the various Traffic Marketplace companies and divisions are  detailed on their individual sites.</p>
        <p> Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect Internet  protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),  referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp. We use the  information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and  navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of content. </p>
        <h6>II. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</h6>
        <p>Traffic Marketplace may share information with its affiliated entities for  or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control,  transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the  Connexus companies. Traffic Marketplace also may release information when we  believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply  with the law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property,  or safety of Traffic Marketplace or others. This includes exchanging  information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
        <h6>III. CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS</h6>
        <p>Because the Traffic Marketplace Site is not directed towards individual  Internet users and does not use cookies, we do not maintain a process for an  individual consumer to review and/or request changes to any PII collected.</p>
        <h6>IV. SECURITY</h6>
        <p>Traffic Marketplace employs industry standard security measures to ensure  the security of all data. Any data that is stored on Traffic Marketplace  servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the  public. Traffic Marketplace has an internal security policy with respect to the  confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access only to those  employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the  purpose of effectively delivering Traffic Marketplace products and services by  means of user login and password requirements. Traffic Marketplace routinely  evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or  opportunities for improvement.</p>
        <p> No transmission of data over the Internet, however, is guaranteed to be  completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control  of Traffic Marketplace to intercept or access transmissions or private  communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your information, Traffic  Marketplace cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit  to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with us.</p>
        <h6>V. CONSENT AND CHANGES</h6>
        <p>Traffic Marketplace may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update  this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on  this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose  it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy  will not affect the privacy of data collected by Traffic Marketplace prior to  the effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and  the opportunity to opt-out.</p>
        <h6>VI. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY AND SPAM</h6>
        <p>Traffic Marketplace is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and  makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet.  Traffic Marketplace web site, products, and services are not developed for or  directed at children. Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible  to do business with us and we do not collect personal information from any  person we actually know is under the age of 13. Traffic Marketplace is  committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM  Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 7701). It is our policy to prohibit the sending of  unsolicited or "Spam" e-mail by Traffic Marketplace or any of its  marketing partners.</p>
        <h6>VII. DATA PROCESSING/SAFE HARBOR</h6>
        <p>The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These  rules differ significantly from US laws. To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a Safe Harbor  that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations.</p>
        <p> Traffic Marketplace adheres to the Safe Harbor  principals. For more information see <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
        <p> By providing information to Traffic Marketplace, you acknowledge that they  operate in the United States and agree to (i) permit Traffic Marketplace to  transmit and use your User information anywhere necessary, including across  international boundaries, to affect the services and transactions provided by  this Site; and (ii) that such use by Traffic Marketplace shall be subject to  the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Statement and applicable Terms  and Conditions and Policies.</p>
        <h6>VIII. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THIRD PARTY INFORMATION &amp; LANGUAGE</h6>
        <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OVER THE PRIVACY OF TRAFFIC  MARKETPLACE DATA OR TRAFFIC MARKETPLACE PRACTICES IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS  OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (WHICH MAY  INCLUDE LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES AND/OR ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES). YOU AGREE THAT  TRAFFIC MARKETPLACE LIABILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL BE  LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE VALUE OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO  YOU BY TRAFFIC MARKETPLACE OR $100 TO THE EXTENT SUCH CLAIM IS NOT OTHERWISE  BARRED BY OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS  GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW WITHOUT REGARD TO  CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES AND THAT ANY ACTION ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS  POLICY WILL BE EXCLUSIVELY VENUED IN A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITUATED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.</p>
        <p> You also agree that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from,  any third party individuals whose personal data you supply to Traffic  Marketplace with regard to: (a) the purposes for which such third party's  personal data has been collected; (b) the intended recipients or categories of  recipients of the third party's personal data; (c) which of the third party's  data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary; and (d) how the  third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them. </p>
