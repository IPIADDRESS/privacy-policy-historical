      <span class="copy"><br><strong>This  Privacy Policy is effective as of </strong><strong>August 10, 2009</strong><strong> </strong><br><br>
Travel Spike LLC ("TS") offers  websites, web publishers and advertisers ("Partners") an advertising  network which includes technology that serves online ads to consumers.&nbsp; <br><br>
This Privacy Policy describes TS’s privacy  policies as they pertain to website visitors to our corporate website located  at www.travelspike.com (our "Site"), and our targeted advertising serving  technology ("Ad Technology"). <br><br>
  <strong>1. Site Privacy Policy</strong> <br><br>
        The main purpose of our company site  is to offer information about TS, our network and other Internet services we  provide. <br><br>
  <u>Information Collected via the Site</u> <br>
We collect Personally Identifiable  Information ("PII") from the Site when you choose to provide it to us  through our contact us form or via email. PII is any information that can be  used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is  not limited to: name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. We  use this personal information only to contact you to respond to your sales or  marketing inquiry. Once collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable time  during the course of normal business operations. <br><br>
  <u>Changing / Deleting your PII</u> <br>
        If you'd like us to update, correct,  delete, or deactivate any PII that you have provided to us on this Site, please  send your request to us at info (at) travelspike (dot) com.&nbsp; We will  do our best to review and process your requests within a reasonable time frame.<br>
        <br>
  &nbsp;<strong>2. Technology Privacy Policy</strong><br><br>
  <u>TS's Ad Technology</u> <br>
        Our Ad Technology matches TS Ads to  consumers based on your interests.&nbsp; Our  Ad Technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the  advertisements that you will be shown. &nbsp;TS  or one of our Partners may run online advertisements on a website that you  visit.&nbsp; <br><br>
        We use the information that we  collect from our Ad Technology to provide reporting data as needed.<br><br>
        TS does not collect PII via our  Technology. Our Technology does collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address  used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many  Partner web pages have been viewed, search terms entered on Partner websites,  referring/exit pages, and the date and time a TS Ad was viewed.<br>
        TS uses this information to serve  ads to consumers that are of interest to them as well to review web traffic  patterns.&nbsp; We also may review information  and data in aggregate so that we can share trends or research with TS's  affiliates, advertisers, employees, customers and Partners.<br><br>
  <u>Cookies, Pixels and Web Beacons</u> <br>
        A cookie stores data on a user’s  hard drive on their computer.&nbsp; TS uses  cookies and web beacons or pixels in connection with our Technology in order to  utilize retargeting. Retargeting is when TS serves a TS Ad to a user after that  user has visited an Advertiser website.&nbsp; Cookies  help TS match a TS Ad to a user so that you will see Ads that are of interest  to you.&nbsp; Cookies are used by many sites  and most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your  browser using the options or preferences section to stop accepting cookies or  prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not  accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all of the features on many  sites that you visit.<br>
        <br>
        TS also uses web beacons to review  web traffic data. The use of a web beacon allows TS to record that someone has  visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website  may choose to include with the beacon.<br><br>
        <u>Data Relating to Non-PII</u><br>
        We keep the Non-PII collected via  our Ad Technology for up to 90 days in order to make sure that our Technology  is working. After 90 days, we may store the data anonymously to be used in  aggregate in the future.<br><br>
  <u>Opting out</u> <br>
        If you'd like to opt-out from having  TS collect your Non-PII in connection with our Ad Technology, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> or email us at info (at) travelspike (dot) com. When you opt out, we  will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not  to collect your Non-PII and not to tailor TS Ads to your interests. You may  need to opt-out again if you delete your cookies or modify your cookie options after  you have opted-out.&nbsp; Cookies are specific  to a computer, so you may also need to opt out again if you use a separate computer  or browser.
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>3. Miscellaneous:</strong> <br><br>
          <u>Security</u> <br>
        TS takes the security of your  information very seriously. We have put in place security measures to protect  the information so that data is kept safe and confidential.&nbsp; <br><br>
  <u>Information Relating to Children</u> <br>
        TS Ads and products are designed for  those over the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the  age of 18. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under  18, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.<br><br>
  <u>Disclosure of Information to Third  Parties</u><br>
        TS does not sell, trade, rent, or release your personal  information to third parties in ways that are not disclosed in the privacy  statement. If we were to ever do so, you will have the opportunity to Opt-Out  beforehand. <br><br>
        We do not collect PII via our  Technology, and we do not sell, rent or share PII collected on the Website with  non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share your  PII with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These  third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide  for purposes other than performing services for us.<br><br>
        We may share Non-PII collected via  our Technology with Web Partners. <br><br>
  <u>Changes to this Privacy Policy</u> <br>
        This privacy policy is subject to  change at any time.&nbsp; We will notify you on  our website on the privacy policy page or via email.<br><br>
  <u>3rd Party Website’s Policies</u><br>
        TS has no control over, nor does it bear any of the responsibility for the privacy policies and/or content of any sites, Partners or advertisers within in the Travel Spike Ad Network or linked to from TravelSpike.com, or the cookies these sites might deposit on your hard drive.  <br><br>
TS is in compliance of the Network  Advertising Initiative ("NAI").
