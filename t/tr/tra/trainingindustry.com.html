<p><strong>COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</strong></p>

<p>Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us.
At Training Industry, Inc., we want to make your experience online
satisfying and safe.</p>

<p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users,
we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions
surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy
statement discloses what information we gather and how we use
it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>INFORMATION TRAINING INDUSTRY, INC. GATHERS AND
TRACKS</strong></p>

<p>Training Industry, Inc. gathers two types of information about
users:</p>

<p>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary
submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our
electronic newsletters and publications, to attend webinars and
events, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a
friend, and for participation in polls and surveys.</p>

<p>Information Training Industry, Inc. gathers through aggregated
tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views
throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor
our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and
sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Under
no circumstances does Training Industry, Inc. divulge any
information about an individual user to a third party.</p>

<p>Training Industry, Inc. gathers user information in the
following processes:</p>

<p>Optional voluntary information</p>

<p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of
voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>

<ol>
<li>Newsletters, Alerts and Publications 

<p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter and publications to
users. Training Industry, Inc. gathers the email addresses of users
who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this
mailing list by following the link provided in every message that
points users to the subscription management page. Users can also
subscribe to the newsletters, bulletins and publications at the
time of registration.</p>
</li>

<li>Message boards/forums 

<p>Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register
separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to
post messages, although they do not need to register to visit the
site. During registration, the user is required to supply a
username, password, and email address.</p>
</li>

<li>"E-mail this to a friend" service 

<p>Users on our site can choose to electronically forward a link,
page, or document to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a
friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that
of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of
transmission errors and to let the recipient know who sent the
email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
</li>

<li>Polling 

<p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share
their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks
about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are
aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user.
Training Industry, Inc. may use a system to "tag" users after they
have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question.
This tag is not correlated with information about individual
users.</p>
</li>

<li>Surveys 

<p>Training Industry, Inc. may occasionally conduct user surveys to
better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the
aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our
sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this
information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Webinars</p>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>Training Industry, Inc. offers a robust calendar of webinar
programs, designed to connect attendees with industry thought
leaders and best practices. By registering for a Training Industry
webinar, professionals consent to receive marketing messages from
Training Industry, Inc. regarding webinars, publications&nbsp;and
other services designed to support training professionals.
Information provided by webinar registrants may be shared with
webinar sponsors to further educational opportunities and knowledge
transfer for training professionals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong></p>

<p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally
identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without
requesting parental consent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Usage tracking</strong></p>

<p>Training Industry, Inc. tracks user traffic patterns throughout
all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information
with data about individual users. Training Industry, Inc. does
break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain
name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from
the browser string (information contained in every user's
browser).</p>

<p>Training Industry, Inc. sometimes tracks and catalogs the search
terms that users enter into our search function, but this tracking
is never associated with individual users. We use tracking
information to determine which areas of our sites users like and
don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what
individual users read, but rather how well each page performs
overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for
you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files
of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal
information although it will enable us to relate your use of this
site to information that you have specifically and knowingly
provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is
information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your
hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Training
Industry, Inc. uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as
described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie
to better track ad impressions and click rates.</p>

<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If
you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you
will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need
to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need
cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling
and surveys.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Training Industry, Inc. uses any information voluntarily given
by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites,
whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the
sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of
our users.</p>

<p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily
provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and
publications and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys,
message boards, forums and events. We send out newsletters to
subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter),
and occasionally send out special editions when we think
subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are
doing. Training Industry, Inc. never shares newsletter mailing
lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or
partners.</p>

<p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our
sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We
do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each
page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better
service for you. We track search terms entered in the search
function as one of many measures of what interests our users. We do
not track the terms a particular user enters.</p>

<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
visit our website. These companies may use information (not
including your name, address, email address, or telephone number)
about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you
would like more information about this practice and to know your
choices about not having this information used by these
companies,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Training Industry, Inc. creates aggregate reports on user
demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and
partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more
effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that
are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage
patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never
know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose
any information about any individual user except to comply with
applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal
safety of our users or the public.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Training Industry, Inc. uses the above-described information to
tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers
better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to
keeping our service free. We will not share information about
individual users with any third party, except to comply with
applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal
safety of our users or the public. SECURITY Training Industry, Inc.
operates secure data networks protected by industry standard
firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy
policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and
only authorized individuals have access to the information provided
by our customers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>OPT-OUT POLICY</strong></p>

<p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such
choices include:</p>

<p>Opting not to register to receive our electronic
newsletters.<br>
 Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which
completely alleviates the need to gather any personally
identifiable information from our users</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>YOUR CONSENT</strong></p>

<p>By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of
this information by Training Industry, Inc.. If we decide to change
our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that
you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
