		Personal identifiable information is information that may be used to identify an individual, including, without limitation, your first and last name, your home or other physical address, your age and income, your electronic mail address, which Internet address you go to, what browser you are using, and other similar information (collectively, "Personal Information"). Traffic.com will ask you for and collect personal identifiable information from you to provide certain services to you; to sell products and services to you; to send promotional e-mails and information about our company; to register for products or services; to register or request to receive updates about our upcoming services; to solicit feedback; and for editorial, internal marketing, and promotional purposes. Traffic.com collects personal identifiable information about you from various sources while you are visiting our Website including, but not limited to, the following: (i) information we collect from you from applications, registration, surveys, and other forms; (ii) information about your transactions with us, our business partners and our suppliers; (iii) information we receive from our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page(s) you requested; and (iv) your e-mail, fax and telephone requests to us for technical support, information, or about our products or services. 
	</p>
	<h3>
		2. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.
	</h3>
	<p>
		Traffic.com and its suppliers, business partners, affiliates, agents and other third parties will use Personal Information to provide you with the products and services you requested, to better understand your needs, and to respond to your requests.  Unless you request otherwise through our opt-out process, we may also use Personal Information to deliver promotional information about Traffic.com and our product and services.  From time to time, we may seek your permission to provide Personal Information (e.g. your email address) to specific business partners for their use in sending you promotional information.  We will provide this information to our partners only if you allow it.  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our partners’ use of such information is consistent with Traffic.com’s Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use many portions of the Website; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Website or the services available on or through the Website that require your Personal Information. 
	</p>
	<h3>
		3. DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.
	</h3>
	<p>
		Traffic.com will not distribute, sell, rent or otherwise disclose your personal identifiable information to any third party except as follows: (i) to business partners, suppliers, affiliates, agents, and other third parties that help us provide certain services and products to you and to process payments (if applicable); (ii) in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with Traffic.com's rights or property, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; (iii) in special circumstances, such as the sale or potential sale of Traffic.com or the bankruptcy of Traffic.com; (iv) when we believe in good faith that it is required by law, or to comply with a court order or other legal process; (v) to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement; and (vi) when you have consented to such disclosure.  Traffic.com takes commercially reasonable precautions to ensure that your Personal Information is used only for its intended purposes.

		We allow you, on our web site, to set and to modify your marketing preferences and/or to opt out of receiving communications from Traffic.com other than those communications which are part of our products and services being provided to you.  If you opt out of such communications, Traffic.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such selections take effect within 24 hours.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also allow you, on our web site, to opt out of consenting to have your Personal Information disclosed to specific partners of Traffic.com with whom we work to deliver our products and service to you.

We may retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some limited circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your Personal Information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.

		Traffic.com reserves the right to send you certain communications related to this Website that are considered part of your account, such as traffic reports and alerts, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
