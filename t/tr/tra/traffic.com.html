</p>
<h2>
2. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.
</h2>
<p>
Traffic.com and its suppliers, business partners, affiliates, agents and other third parties will use Personal Information to provide you with the products and services you requested, to better understand your needs, and to respond to your requests.  Unless you request otherwise through our opt-out process, we may also use Personal Information to deliver promotional information about Traffic.com and our product and services.  From time to time, we may seek your permission to provide Personal Information (e.g. your email address) to specific business partners for their use in sending you promotional information.
