            <strong>Effective date:&nbsp;February 2010</strong><br><br>We take your trust seriously, and our goal is to safeguard your privacy while providing you with the best possible experience using our products and services. NAVTEQ North America, LLC and its affiliated companies and properties (collectively, "NAVTEQ") provide this notice explaining our information collection practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used when you inquire about or purchase our products (the "Products"), or use our websites and navigational services (collectively, the "Services"). <br><br>NAVTEQ certifies compliance with the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">United States Department of Commerce's U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework</a>, and adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles. <br><br><strong>What NAVTEQ Collects</strong> <br><br>In the course of inquiring about or using NAVTEQ's Products or Services, NAVTEQ may ask you for, among other things, your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, fax number and other registration information. NAVTEQ may request billing and payment information under certain circumstances, such as when you make a purchase from us, including through one of our online stores. <br><br>NAVTEQ also may collect certain technical information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider, aggregate data about the number of visits to a site or Service, and/or aggregate data about the pages visited. We may combine information we receive online with other information you have provided to us and with information from other sources to improve our knowledge of you as a customer, to help us provide quality customer service, to provide and customize our Products and Services, and to offer certain Products and Services to you subject to your marketing preferences. <br><br>If you access NAVTEQ Products and Services from a mobile device, NAVTEQ may collect limited information from your device, including location data, but will not store this information in a manner that identifies you individually unless you consent for us to do so. <br><br>Some NAVTEQ Products and Services, including some of our online stores, are co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. By registering for or using these Products and Services, both NAVTEQ and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded Products and Services. <br><br><strong>How NAVTEQ Uses the Information</strong> <br><br>Except as otherwise indicated, NAVTEQ uses the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you provide: 
<ul>
<li>to fulfill your requests for our Products and Services and those of our partners and to respond to your inquiries about our offerings; </li>

<li>to assist us in the development of new Products or Services and/or the improvement of our existing Products and Services; </li>
<li>to cooperate with government officials or parties in litigation under process of law or regulation, or as otherwise required or permitted by law; </li>
<li>to protect the security or integrity of the Products or Services, and/or to enforce the terms governing their use; </li>
<li>to protect against a threat of safety or destruction of property; and/or </li>
<li>to protect against legal liability.</li></ul>Authorized NAVTEQ service providers and contractors may have access to your information to facilitate its use consistent with this Policy. <br><br>NAVTEQ may use and store non-personally identifiable information, including anonymized and aggregated data, for any purpose, without limitation, including to generate reporting and to improve the design and content of our Products and Services, and NAVTEQ may share this data with third-parties. <br><br><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong> <br><br>NAVTEQ may disclose Personal Information we maintain about you to non-affiliated third parties under the following types of circumstances: when we have your permission to do so; to comply with the law, or when we respond to a subpoena or other process, legal order, or official request; as otherwise required by law; to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or, as permitted by applicable law, when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of the legal terms that govern your use of our Products and Services. In addition, NAVTEQ may transfer both Personal Information and non-personally identifiable information if NAVTEQ is acquired by or merged with another company. <br><br><strong>Your Marketing Preferences</strong> <br><br>We generally ask you for your marketing preferences at the time we collect your information. If you wish to change your marketing preferences after collection, visit our <a href="http://corporate.navteq.com/webapps/contactus/contact.jsp?lang=en" target="_blank">Contact</a> page.

For those Products and Services, you may also be able to update your marketing preferences by viewing your account information online. Some mandatory service messages are required for use of the Products or Services, and are not subject to opt-out. <br><br>If you wish to access your Personal Information to correct, amend, or delete that information when it is inaccurate, you can request to do so through our <a href="http://corporate.navteq.com/webapps/contactus/contact.jsp?lang=en" target="_blank">Contact</a> page. <br><br><strong>Security</strong> <br><br>NAVTEQ has implemented security measures to help protect against the risk of loss, misuse and alteration of any information under NAVTEQ's control. For example, NAVTEQ protects online order information through use of encryption, such as by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. <br><br><strong>Storage and Retention</strong> <br><br>Your Personal Information will not be stored for longer than is necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, or to otherwise meet legal requirements. <br><br><strong>IP Addresses and Cookies</strong> <br><br>Like other web sites, NAVTEQ uses your domain, IP address and browser information to help diagnose problems with NAVTEQ's Products and Services and equipment, to administer the Products and Services, and for security purposes.
