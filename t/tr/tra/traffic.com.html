		Traffic.com, Inc. and it affiliates (collectively, "Traffic.com") respect the privacy of the visitors to our web site at www.traffic.com and affiliate websites and any co branded, derivative or successor site (collectively, the "Website") and are committed to protecting your privacy. Traffic.com has established this Privacy Statement to inform you of our policies and practices regarding how we collect information from you, how we use and disclose it, and your rights with respect to such information.
	</p>
	
	<h3>1.	COLLECTION OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</h3>
	
	<p>
		Personal identifiable information is information that may be used to identify an individual, including, without limitation, your first and last name, your home or other physical address, your age and income, your electronic mail address, which Internet address you go to, what browser you are using, and other similar information (collectively, "Personal Information").  Traffic.com will ask you for and collect personal identifiable information from you to provide certain services to you; to sell products and services to you; to send promotional e-mails and information about our company; to register for products or services; register or request to receive updates about our upcoming services; to solicit feedback; and for editorial, internal marketing, and promotional purposes.  Traffic.com collects personal identifiable information about you from various sources while you are visiting our Website including, but not limited to, the following:  (i) information we collect from you from applications, registrations, surveys, and other forms; (ii) information about your transactions with us, our business partners and our suppliers; (iii) information we receive from our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page(s) you requested; and (iv) your e-mail, fax and telephone requests to us for technical support, information, or about our products or services.
	</p>
	
	<h3>2.	USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h3>
	
	<p>
		Traffic.com and its suppliers, business partners, affiliates, agents and other third parties will use Personal Information to provide you with the products and services you requested and to better understand your needs.  Unless otherwise informed to the contrary, we use Personal Information to respond to your requests for information about our company or to provide to you our products and services.  You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information.  In such an event, you can still access and use many portions of the Website; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Website or the services available on or through the Website that require your Personal Information.
	</p>
	
	<h3>3.	DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</h3>
	
	<p>
		Traffic.com will not distribute, sell, rent or otherwise disclose your personal identifiable information to any third party except as follows:  (i) to business partners, suppliers, affilitate, agents, and other third parties that help us provide certain services and products to you and to process payments (if applicable); (ii) in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with Traffic.com's rights or property, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; (iii) in special circumstances, such as the sale or potential sale of Traffic.com or the bankruptcy of Traffic.com; (iv) when we believe in good faith that it is required by law, or to comply with a court order or other legal process; (v) enforce our Terms of Use Agreement; and (vi) when you have consented to such disclosure.  Traffic.com takes commercially reasonable precautions to ensure that your Personal Information is used only for its intended purposes.

We may retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some limited circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your Personal Information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.  Traffic.com reserves the right to send you certain communications related to this Website that are considered part of your account, such as technical alerts, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
