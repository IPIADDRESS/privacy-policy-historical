We may also use "cookies" to offer you other insurance and financial services products that may suit your needs. During the period you are logged into our site, we log IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain name, access times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site) and your activity while using our site. We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, secure servers and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit over the Internet. It is important to note that e-mail messages are not secure. E-mail messages traveling through the Internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet.
