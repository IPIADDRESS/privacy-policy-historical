<h2>PRIVACY POLICY - COMMUNITY MEMBERS</h2>
<p>This privacy policy applies to any information collected or otherwise obtained on or through the website located at http://trustedpros.ca (the “<strong>Website</strong>”) and, unless otherwise specified, any other websites controlled or operated by TrustedPros Inc., which are accessible through the Website.</p>
<p>
 This privacy policy is effective as of the date set forth above. Personal information provided or collected prior to the above effective date shall be subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such personal information was provided or collected.&nbsp; </p><p>
 Titles and headings are provided for general reference and ease of use only, as information may be covered in more than one heading or under other headings.</p><p>
 If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, any personal information about you in our possession or under our control or any of our practices with respect to personal information, please contact TPI's privacy officer at privacy@trustedpros.ca.</p><p>
 <strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong></p><p>
 TPI is committed to protecting your privacy. Unless expressly provided, data collected is for the sole purpose of the operation of this Website and providing the services offered through this Website (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).&nbsp; </p><p>
 <u>Registration</u></p><p>
 Personal information is collected in conjunction with the creation of your account for the Website, namely your name, e-mail address, city and province (or state) of residence, postal code (or zip code) and confirmation that you have reached the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside. You may also choose to provide us with a telephone number.&nbsp; </p><p>
 <u>Financial Information</u> </p><p>
 We do not collect any personal information of a financial nature about you. </p><p>
 <u>Website and Services</u></p><p>
 Personal information may also be collected in conjunction with your access and use of the Website and Services.&nbsp; For example, if you post content on the Website (such as a message, job listing, testimonial or a rating or review), such posting will be associated to your account and any personal information contained in such posting will be accessible to other users of the Website.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;TPI may monitor your use of the Website and Services and may create records of your use of the Website and Services.</p><p>
 This Website uses cookies.&nbsp; A cookie is a piece of data tied to information about the user and stored on the user's computer. This Website uses both session cookies, which terminate when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until manually deleted.</p><p>
 By setting a persistent cookie, we allow you not to have to log in with a password more than once, thereby saving time while accessing the Website. If you reject these cookies, you may still access and use the Website but your experience and/or access may be limited in some areas of the Website. </p><p>
 TPI may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on its behalf and to monitor certain pages of the Website for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement “click-throughs”, and/or other activities on our site. These third party service providers may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p><p>
 As is the case with most other websites, personal information may also be collected by TPI with respect to your system and your specific access to and use of the Website and Services. Such information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamps, number of clicks, cookies, clear gifs, user profiles and log files detailing access dates and times, webpages visited and features used.&nbsp; A profile is stored information that TPI keeps on individual users that detail such users’ viewing preferences, Website activities and interactions and exchanges with TPI.&nbsp; Like most standard Website servers we use log files. </p><p>
 <strong>Use of Personal Information</strong> </p><p>
 As indicated above, we will use personal information obtained for the purposes of operating the Website and providing the Services.&nbsp; This includes us communicating with you with respect to your use of the Website, your use of Services (including, for example, obtaining clarification or confirmation of Services requested and information submitted in conjunction with the obtaining of such Services), your account and responding to inquiries made by you.&nbsp; This also includes allowing you to make postings in certain sections of the Website (such as message-board posts, job requests, personal anecdotes, success stories, evaluations of contractors and suppliers and reviews and detailing of specific projects).&nbsp; You understand and agree that to the extent you include personal information in a posting, such personal information will be posted on the Website and will be accessible to other users of the Website.</p><p>
 Likewise, the Website offers matching services in terms of job requests and contractors and suppliers.&nbsp; To the extent you post a job request, the Services will attempt to match such job request to contractors and suppliers.&nbsp; To the extent matches are found, your name will be provided to those matching contractors and suppliers and such contractors will be allowed to communicate with you via e-mail through the Website’s message delivery system.&nbsp; Moreover, we may send you offers through email or otherwise which we deem relevant to your specific project. You may at any time opt out from receiving future offers by clicking on the opt-out hyperlink shown in such e-mail, at which time you will be removed from the relevant distribution list within a 30 day period.</p><p>
 Similarly, we may from time to time contact you via e-mail about Services or other features of the Website or send you updates about the Website and the Services, including, newsletters and bulletins.&nbsp; &nbsp;We may also from time to time contact you via e-mail about products and services of other members of the Website or other third parties. You may at any time opt out from receiving future communications by clicking on the opt-out hyperlink shown in such e-mail, at which time you will be removed from the relevant distribution list within a 30 day period.</p><p>
 We sometimes partner with third parties who provide complimentary services or host portals providing access to the Website and/or the Services.&nbsp; In conjunction with the foregoing, we may provide your name and e-mail address to such third parties for the sole purpose of allowing such third parties to contact you via e-mail about their services and other products, including newsletters and bulletins.&nbsp; Each such third party is required to include in such communications a hyperlink or other manner of opting out from receipt of future communications from such third party. You may always contact us in the event of any problems or delays with respect to such un-subscription with respect to such communications.</p><p>
 Finally, collected information regarding access and usage of the Website and Services is tied to the users’ personally identifiable information to improve the performance, security, content and features of the Website and delivery of Services (including, your accessing and use of the Website and Services), and to modify and/or expand Website functionality and nature and scope of Services.&nbsp; Such information is also used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p><p>
 Users’ profile information is also used to tailor, ease, improve, facilitate and accelerate a user's access and use of the Website and Services (e.g. by remembering user preferences and applying these to subsequent visits).</p><p>
 On rare occasions, TPI may send out strictly service related e-mail announcements. These communications are not promotional in nature.&nbsp; For instance, if TPI’s service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an e-mail advising them of this. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account which will prevent future communications of such sort. </p><p>
 <strong>Modification of Personal Information</strong></p><p>
 To the extent your personal information has changed or that our records are otherwise not accurate with respect to your personal information, please contact our privacy officer by e-mail at privacy@trustedpros.ca.&nbsp; We will endeavour to update your personal information in a timely manner.</p><p>
 TPI may paraphrase, summarize, aggregate or compile Feedback, Ratings, Reviews, Rebuttals and/or Testimonials and may edit these to correct typos, spelling and grammatical errors as well as obvious mistakes in terms of objective facts.</p><p>
 To the extent permitted by applicable laws, TPI reserves the right to deny requests to remove any Feedback, Ratings, Reviews, Rebuttals and/or Testimonials from the Website, including members profile information associated with any such feedback, ratings, reviews, rebuttals and/or Testimonials.</p><p>
 <strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p><p>
 When you submit information to TPI, you authorize us to share this information with our service providers.&nbsp; TPI shall ensure that any third party to whom it discloses your personal information has signed a contract which obligates such third party to safeguard your personal information, adhere to the same terms and conditions as those contained in this privacy policy and otherwise comply with applicable laws. .&nbsp; </p><p>
 Use certain Services and features of the Website will result in the disclosure of personal information.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to select a contractor for a job posting or if you respond to a contractor who has indicated interest in a job posting, such contractor will receive your name and contact information.&nbsp; Likewise, as previously indicated, postings made by you on the Website or through use of a Service will be accessible to other users of the Website.&nbsp; To the extent such postings contain personal information, such personal information will therefore be communicated to users who access such posting.</p><p>
 TPI may create and share aggregated activity or statistical information with partners, advertisers or others, but such information shall not contain personally identifiable information.</p><p>
 <strong>Safeguarding of Personal Information</strong></p><p>
 Though we strive to preserve user privacy, due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will always remain confidential. &nbsp;You acknowledge and understand that the Internet is a public network and that communications on or through the Internet may be intercepted, misdirected, altered and/or deleted.&nbsp; Likewise, e-mails and accounts may be spoofed and individuals impersonated.&nbsp; Care should therefore be taken prior to disclosing personal information on or through the Website or to any users or purported users of the Website.</p><p>
 Likewise, we may disclose personal information when required by law (including by court order or in conjunction with legal proceedings), when we have a belief that such action is necessary or advisable to comply with applicable laws, or when we believe that a user is violating the law, is a threat to others or himself/herself or is in personal danger. </p><p>
 <strong>Mergers/Acquisitions/Restructuring</strong></p><p>
 In the event TPI (or any of its business units) is bought, sold, restructured or merges with another entity, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of such transaction. TPI may disclose your personal information to such entities and their advisors, provide it first ensures that each of them sign a non-disclosure agreement safeguarding your personal information and preventing them from making any use of the information outside of such proposed transaction or restructuring and any subsequent operation of TPI’s business.&nbsp; </p><p>
 <strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p><p>
 Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the operation of the Website and delivery of Services they have requested.&nbsp; Such opt-out option is usually provided at the time of collection and/or in subsequent communications to the user. For example, our service request form has an 'opt-out' mechanism allowing users who submit a service request to elect not to receive any marketing material.</p><p>
 If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by selecting the opt-out hyperlink in the relevant email or by emailing us at privacy@trustedpros.ca.</p><p>
 You will be notified when personal information collected through use of the Website is to be communicated to a third party (excluding our affiliates, service providers, or agents). We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p><p>
 <strong><u>Links and Integrated Partnerships</u></strong></p><p>
 This Website contains links from and to other websites. Please be aware that this privacy policy does not apply to such websites and that personal information you disclose or that may otherwise be collected from you may not be subject to the same terms and conditions as those that apply with respect to TPI and the Website.&nbsp; TPI is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware of this when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements or policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by TPI in conjunction with the operation of the Website and delivery of Services.</p><p>
 <strong><u>Location of Computer Facilities</u></strong></p><p>
 Your personal information may be stored outside of the Province of Ontario to the extent we use service providers located outside of Ontario.&nbsp; This is presently the case as this Website is hosted from facilities located in the United States.&nbsp; You acknowledge and understand that the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (Canada) may apply and otherwise affect the collection, use, disclosure, retention and destruction of your personal information.&nbsp; Additional privacy legislation may also apply depending on the location of our service providers, our computer facilities or those of our service providers.</p>
<p><strong>By creating an Account, and by accessing and using this Website and any service offered by or through this Website, you hereby consent and agree to the practices described in this privacy policy, including, without limitation, the collection, use, disclosure, retention, storage and destruction practices relating to your personal information.&nbsp; Without limitation to the foregoing, you also agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.</strong></p><a name="1" id="1"></a>
