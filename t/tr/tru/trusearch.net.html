        <strong>General</strong><br>
        At TruSearch, we respect the privacy of our customers and we've created 
        this privacy statement so that you have easy access to information about 
        our privacy practices. In general, trusearch.net does not collect, store,
        use or disclose personally identifying information except in very specific 
        instances, such as, for example, when you enroll as an advertiser with 
        us. Whenever we collect such information, you will have a choice regarding 
        whether to provide it, how it will be used, and to whom it will be disclosed. 
        The instances in which TruSearch does collect and use information are 
        specifically described in this Privacy Policy. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#4E4E4E"><strong>Information 
        we request, and how we use it</strong> <br>
        In several areas during sign up we ask you to provide various information 
        by filling out and submitting an online form. We ask for your name, address 
        and contact information so we can send you your order, and so we can contact 
        you if we have a question about your order. We ask for credit card information 
        so we can fulfill your order, and so we can provide this information to 
        the company or companies who process your credit card payment. We do not 
        share or sell your personal information, including email addresses. EVER! 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#4E4E4E"><strong>Information 
        we do not collect</strong> <br>
        When you visit our site, we do not collect your name, email address or 
        any other personal information unless you provide it to us. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#4E4E4E"><strong>How 
        we use email</strong> <br>
        After you place an order on our site, you will receive an email confirmation 
        of your order. You will receive these emails only if you have provided 
        your email address during checkout. Occasionally, we send a TruSearch 
        Newsletter, our email update on sales and products, to opt-in subscribers 
        who we think might be interested in learning about sales and special events 
        at our site. Unsubscribe instructions are included in each edition of 
        the newsletter so that you may unsubscribe at any time. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#4E4E4E"><strong>Information we do 
        not share with others</strong> <br>
        TruSearch does not share, sell or trade email addresses, information collected 
        as part of a survey or specific details about you or your household. We 
        do not contribute to or participate in shared or cooperative databases, 
        which give other companies access to your personal information. We do 
        not release credit card or financial information for use by other companies. 
        For privacy purposes, all information relating to our customers is stored 
        on our highly secure server, and all credit card information is stored 
        in an encrypted format. <br>
