Some information about you will automatically be collected from Social Networks when connecting your TrustedCompany.com profile with your profile on Social Networks. The information collected from Social Networks depends on what information you have made available on the network and your privacy settings for sharing such information on the network. Depending on the settings, we may e.g. collect the following information about you:</span>
              <ul>
                <li><span>Name and / or username</span></li>
