		<h2>3. The use of online session information</h2>
		<p>"Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Trustly may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

If you choose to eliminate cookies, the full functionality of the Service may be impaired for you.</p>
		<p>When you use the Service, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address and pages visited. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve the Service.</p>
		
		<p>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities using log files. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns. We do not share any personal information about our customers with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect such information on our behalf. Our third party service providers are required to comply fully with this PrivacyPolicy.</p>

		<h2>4. Disclosure of your information to protect our rights or if required by law</h2>
		<p>Trustly reserves the right (and you hereby authorize Trustly) to share or disclose your personal information when Trustly determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of such information is necessary or appropriate:</p>
		<p>1. To prevent prohibited or illegal activities;</p>
		<p>2. To enforce our rights against you or in connection with a breach by you of this Privacy or the End User Agreement; or </p>
		<p>3. When required by any applicable law, regulation, subpoena or other legal process.</p>

		<h2>5. Access to personally identifiable information</h2>
		<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update it by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@trustly.com">support@trustly.com</a>. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.</p>

		<h2>7. Links to other sites</h2>
		<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Trustly. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>

		<h2>8. Security</h2>
		<p>We use a combination of encryption techniques firewall barriers, and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect the Service from unauthorized access.</p>
		<p>Our servers are in a secure facility. Our databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. We encrypt your Service password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us. All backup drives and tapes also are encrypted.</p>
		<p>We enforce physical access controls to our buildings.</p>
		<p>No employee may put any sensitive content on any insecure machine (i.e., nothing can be taken from the database and put on an insecure laptop).</p>
		<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as financial information)  on our forms we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@trustly.com">support@trustly.com</a>.</p>

		<h2>9. Notification of privacy policy changes</h2>
		<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address submitted to us) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
