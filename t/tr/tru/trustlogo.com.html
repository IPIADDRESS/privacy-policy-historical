              Practice Statement (CPS). Please refer to these documents for the

            <p><span class="p4">Informational Collection and Use</span><br>
              <span class="p8">Comodo do not collect any information on customers 
              without consent. As part of the service offerings, customers will 
              be prompted for information when enrolling for a certificate, downloading 
              a product or requesting further information. No information is collected 
              about a customer if just browsing the website.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">Certificate enrolment</span><br>
              <span class="p8">When enrolling for a certificate, customers will 
              be required to provide certain information as per the requirements 
              for the certificate product type. The exact informational requirements 
              are set out in the relevant Subscriber Agreement and associated 
              schedules and listed in the Comodo CPS. Some of the submitted details 
              will be displayed within the certificate and as a result will be 
              publicly available. Details that will become public are clearly 
              stated as 'public' in the enrolment process, Subscriber Agreement 
              and associated schedules. </span> </p>

              TrustToolbar Plug-in, you will be required to submit personal information 
              as specified on the download page. This information will be used 
              by Comodo to contact the customer about the services on our site 
              for which they have expressed interest, including product updates 
              and associated promotional material. It also aids Comodo in providing 
              improved global services by collating general demographic information. 
              Please refer to the opt-out policy described later in this policy 
              statement.</span></p>

              <span class="p8">Comodo provide the ability to request further information 
              or ask questions to the support team by displaying email links throughout 
              the website. If a customer elects to use such links they may be 
              requested to provide additional information depending on the nature 
              of the contact. Typically, such additional information may include 
              further contact details, and in the case of technical support, additional 
              information about the customer's PC configuration may be required 
              to aid a prompt a accurate response to the query.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">Cookies</span><br>
              <span class="p8">A cookie is a piece of data stored on a computer's 
              hard disk containing information about the owner. Comodo employ 
              the use of cookies to gauge success of internal marketing campaigns 
              and within the use of the Referrer programs. Such cookies contain 
              no personally identifiable information. Our partners may also use 
              cookies. Comodo do not exercise any access or control of such cookies.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">Log Files</span><br>
              <span class="p8">Comodo use log files comprising of IP addresses 
              to analyse trends, administer the site, track movements throughout 
              the site, calculate the number of document and file downloads, and 
              gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses 
              are not linked to personally identifiable information.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">Sharing</span><br>
              <span class="p8">Comodo will share aggregated demographic information 
              with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information 
              that can identify any individual person.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">External Links</span><br>
              <span class="p8">The Comodo website contains links to external websites. 
              Comodo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
              sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
              by this website. Comodo have no control over the accuracy of information 
              displayed by such websites.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">Security</span><br>
              <span class="p8">This website takes every precaution to protect 
              our customer's information. When customers submit sensitive information 
              via the website, such information is protected both online and off-line.</span></p>
            <p class="p8">During certificate enrolment, where sensitive information 
              is required, the transmission of information is encrypted and protected 
              using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This includes the submission of 
              any payment information such as credit card details.</p>
            <p class="p8">Comodo use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
              online and do everything in our power to protect user-information 
              off-line. All of our customer's information, not just the sensitive 
              information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only 
              employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for 
              example billing administration or the development team) are granted 
              access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must 
              use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. 
              When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access 
              to customer information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date 
              on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as 
              any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
              reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they 
              can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. The servers 
              that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in 
              a secure environment, behind a locked cage. The cryptographic keys 
              used to issue certificates are maintained in the secure environment 
              of FIPS-140 level 4 accredited IBM 4758 crypto devices.</p>
            <p><span class="p4">Supplementation of Information (validation of 
              submitted details)</span><br>
              <span class="p8">In order for Comodo to properly fulfil its obligation 
              to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information 
              we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</span></p>
            <p class="p8">For example, prior to the issuance of some certificate 
              types Comodo may use the WHOIS database, Government sourced companies 
              house database or Dun &amp; Bradstreet company lookup information 
              to validate the accuracy of supplied data. This is an integral aspect 
              of the service provided by Comodo.</p>
            <p><span class="p4">Service Updates</span><br>
              <span class="p8">Established customers will occasionally receive 
              information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. 
              Out of respect for the privacy of our customers we present the option 
              not to receive these types of communications. We also send the user 
              service announcement updates. Customers are not able to unsubscribe 
              from service announcements, which may contain important security 
              information about the service.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">Updating Customer Information</span><br>
              <span class="p8">If a customer's personally identifiable information 
              or certificate specific information changes they may update the 
              original information provided. Changes can be made by logging into 
              the Members area and using the services provided in the Manage Account 
              section.</span></p>
            <p><span class="p4">Choice / Opt out</span><br>
              <span class="p8">Customers are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' 
              of having information used for purposes not directly related to 
              the Comodo service offering at the point where the information is 
              requested. For example, all certificate enrolment and product downloads 
              has an 'opt-out' mechanism so customers who buy a product from us, 
              but would prefer not to receive any marketing material, can request 
              to have their email address kept off of our lists.</span></p>
            <p class="p8">If customers no longer wish to receive our newsletter 
              or promotional materials from our partners, they may opt-out of 
              receiving these communications by emailing Comodo at <a href="mailto:webmaster@comodo.net">webmaster@comodo.net</a>. 
            </p>
            <p class="p8">Customers of our site are always notified when their 
              information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this 
              so our customers can make an informed choice as to whether they 
              should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p>
            <p><span class="p4">Certificate Revocation &amp; Expiry</span><br>
              <span class="p8">Access to all issued certificates is provided through 
              the Comodo public repository. Because of the nature of the service 
              provided, there may be circumstances under which a certificate is 
              revoked (cancelled). Furthermore, as the lifetime of all certificates 
              is finite (lasting usually 1 year), certificates will expire.</span></p>
            <p class="p8">Comodo still provides public access to both revoked 
              and expired certificates to ensure a party relying on the certificate 
              may still be able to retrieve the certificate and verify a signature 
              made with the certificate. Such certificates are flagged as revoked 
              or expired within the repository.</p>
            <p><span class="p4">Customer consent</span><br>
              <span class="p8">By using our Web site, customers consent to the 
              collection and use of this information by Comodo Limited. If any 
              subsequent changes are made to our privacy policy, we will post 
              those changes on the policy update page so that customers are always 
              aware of what information is collected, how it is used and under 
              what circumstances it may be disclosed.</span><br>
