<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
 <p>As part of the Comodo pledge 
                    to our customers, we recognise and respect your right to privacy. 
                    This privacy policy statement informs our customers of the 
                    privacy practices employed in the provision of Comodo's products, 
                    services and website. </p>
                  <p>Questions relating to this policy 
                    statement should be directed towards the Comodo support team 
                    at:</p>

				  <h2>CPS and Associated Agreements</h2>
                  <p>
                    This Privacy Policy statement supplements the practices and 
                    policies stated within the Subscriber Agreement (and associated 
                    product Schedules), Relying Party Agreement and Comodo Certification 
                    Practice Statement (CPS). Please refer to these documents 
                    for the practices employed by Comodo for the issuing, management 
                    and revocation of certificate based products.</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.comodogroup.com/repository/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.comodogroup.com/repository/index.html</a> 
                   
                  </p>
				  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                  <p>
                    Comodo do not collect any information 
                    on customers without consent. As part of the service offerings, 
                    customers will be prompted for information when enrolling 
                    for a certificate, downloading a product or requesting further 
                    information. No information is collected about a customer 
                    if just browsing the website.</p>
					<h2>Certificate Enrolment</h2>
                    <p>
                    When enrolling for a certificate, 
                    customers will be required to provide certain information 
                    as per the requirements for the certificate product type. 
                    The exact informational requirements are set out in the relevant 
                    Subscriber Agreement and associated schedules and listed in 
                    the Comodo CPS. Some of the submitted details will be displayed 
                    within the certificate and as a result will be publicly available. 
                    Details that will become public are clearly stated as 'public' 
                    in the enrolment process, Subscriber Agreement and associated 
                    schedules. </p>
					<h2>Product Download</h2>
                    <p>
                    When downloading a Comodo product, 
                    such as the TrustToolbar Plug-in, you will be required to 
                    submit personal information as specified on the download page. 
                    This information will be used by Comodo to contact the customer 
                    about the services on our site for which they have expressed 
                    interest, including product updates and associated promotional 
                    material. It also aids Comodo in providing improved global 
                    services by collating general demographic information. Please 
                    refer to the opt-out policy described later in this policy 
                    statement.</p>
					<h2>Information Request</h2>
                    <p>
                    Comodo provides the ability to request further information 
                    or ask questions to the support team by displaying email links 
                    throughout the website. If a customer elects to use such links 
                    they may be requested to provide additional information depending 
                    on the nature of the contact. Typically, such additional information 
                    may include further contact details, and in the case of technical 
                    support, additional information about the customer's PC configuration 
                    may be required to aid a prompt a accurate response to the 
                    query.</p>

                    A cookie is a piece of data stored 
                    on a computer's hard disk containing information about the 
                    owner. Comodo employ the use of cookies to gauge success of 
                    internal marketing campaigns and within the use of the Referrer

                    information. Our partners may also use cookies. Comodo do 
                    not exercise any access or control of such cookies.</p>
					<h2>Log Files</h2>
                  <p>
                    Comodo use log files comprising 
                    of IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track 
                    movements throughout the site, calculate the number of document 
                    and file downloads, and gather broad demographic information 
                    for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally 
                    identifiable information.</p>
					<h2>sharing</h2>
                    <p>
                    Comodo will share aggregated demographic information with 
                    our partners. This is not linked to any personal information 
                    that can identify any individual person.</p>
					<h2>External Links</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Comodo website contains links to external websites. Comodo 
                    is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
                    sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
                    collected by this website. Comodo have no control over the 
                    accuracy of information displayed by such websites.</p>
					<h2>Security</h2>
                   <p>
                    This website takes every precaution 
                    to protect our customer's information. When customers submit 
                    sensitive information via the website, such information is 
                    protected both online and off-line.</p>
                  <p>During certificate enrolment, 
                    where sensitive information is required, the transmission 
                    of information is encrypted and protected using Secure Sockets 
                    Layer (SSL). This includes the submission of any payment information 
                    such as credit card details.</p>
                  <p>Comodo use SSL encryption to 
                    protect sensitive information online and do everything in 
                    our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our 
                    customer's information, not just the sensitive information 
                    mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees 
                    who need the information to perform a specific job (for example 
                    billing administration or the development team) are granted 
                    access to personally identifiable information. Our employees 
                    must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave 
                    their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password 
                    to re-gain access to customer information. Furthermore, ALL 
                    employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy 
                    practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies 
                    are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about 
                    the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to 
                    ensure our customers' information is protected. The servers 
                    that we store personally identifiable information on are kept 
                    in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. The cryptographic 
                    keys used to issue certificates are maintained in the secure 
                    environment of FIPS-140 level 4 accredited IBM 4758 crypto 
                    devices.</p>
					<h2>Supplementation of Information (validation of submitted details)</h2>
                    <p>
                    In order for Comodo to properly 
                    fulfil its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for 
                    us to supplement the information we receive with information 
                    from 3rd party sources.</p>
                  <p>For example, prior to the issuance 
                    of some certificate types Comodo may use the WHOIS database, 
                    Government sourced companies house database or Dun &amp; Bradstreet 
                    company lookup information to validate the accuracy of supplied 
                    data. This is an integral aspect of the service provided by 
                    Comodo.</p>
					<h2>Service Updates</h2>
                    <p>
                    Established customers will occasionally 
                    receive information on products, services, special deals, 
                    and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our customers 
                    we present the option not to receive these types of communications. 
                    We also send the user service announcement updates. Customers 
                    are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which 
                    may contain important security information about the service. 
                    </p>
					<h2>Updating Customer Information</h2>
                    <p>
                    If a customer's personally identifiable 
                    information or certificate specific information changes they 
                    may update the original information provided. Changes can 
                    be made by logging into the Members area and using the services 
                    provided in the Manage Account section. </p>
					<h2>Choice / Opt Out</h2>
                    <p>
                    Customers are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having 
                    information used for purposes not directly related to the 
                    Comodo service offering at the point where the information 
                    is requested. For example, all certificate enrolment and product 
                    downloads has an 'opt-out' mechanism so customers who buy 
                    a product from us, but would prefer not to receive any marketing 
                    material, can request to have their email address kept off 
                    of our lists.</p>
                  <p>If customers no longer wish 
                    to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our 
                    partners, they may opt-out of receiving these communications 
                    by emailing Comodo at <a href="mailto:webmaster@comodogroup.com">webmaster@comodogroup.com</a></p>
                  <p>Customers of our site are always 
                    notified when their information is being collected by any 
                    outside parties. We do this so our customers can make an informed 
                    choice as to whether they should proceed with services that 
                    require an outside party, or not.</p>
					<h2>Certificate Revocation and Expiry</h2>
					<p>
                    Access to all issued certificates 
                    is provided through the Comodo public repository. Because 
                    of the nature of the service provided, there may be circumstances 
                    under which a certificate is revoked (cancelled). Furthermore, 
                    as the lifetime of all certificates is finite (lasting usually 
                    1 year), certificates will expire.</p>
                  <p>Comodo still provides public 
                    access to both revoked and expired certificates to ensure 
                    a party relying on the certificate may still be able to retrieve 
                    the certificate and verify a signature made with the certificate. 
                    Such certificates are flagged as revoked or expired within 
                    the repository.</p>
					<h2>Customer Consent</h2>
                   <p>
                    By using our Web site, customers 
                    consent to the collection and use of this information by Comodo 
                    Limited. If any subsequent changes are made to our privacy 
                    policy, we will post those changes on the policy update page 
                    so that customers are always aware of what information is 
                    collected, how it is used and under what circumstances it 
                    may be disclosed. <br>
