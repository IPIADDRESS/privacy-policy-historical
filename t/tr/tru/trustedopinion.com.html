<h2>6.	Sharing of Information</h2>

</p><p>
</p><div style="padding: 0 0 0 50;">
<b>During your Use of Trusted Opinion</b>
<p>
As a registered Trusted Opinion user, you decide how much information you want to disclose in your profile.   By default, your full name and your email address are only shown to your 1<sup>st</sup> Circle Friends.   1st Circle Friends are the Friends that you invite into your network, or where you accept an invitation to join a network.  Your photo, website and blog links, all of which are optional, are by default shown to all users in your extended network.

</p><p>
You can change the privacy setting for your name, email address, photo, website and blog at any time by going to your "My Account" section and selecting "Show only to 1<sup>st</sup> Circle Friends" or "Show to All" in your extended network from the drop down boxes.  Friends in your extended network will only be able to view the information you decide to make public and your reviews.

</p><p>
You can search for users who are not in your extended network by their email address.  If there is a match we will disclose the user's information  according to their preferred privacy settings in "My Account" as described above.  You can then send an invitation to your network to that user.  If you select "Show to All" in your privacy settings, other users will be able to see your information if they search for you by email address.

</p><p>
When you upload your friends' email addresses into the Service, we will only use these email addresses to connect you with other users or to allow you to invite your friends to use Trusted Opinion. We will not disclose these email addresses to any third parties or business partners for marketing purposes.

</p><p>
<b>To Third Party Partners </b>
</p><p>
	We may use cookies by third party partners to help analyze and optimize our online traffic and to display advertisements.  We control how this data may and may not be used by our partners.
</p><p>
	We may share aggregate information that does not identify you with our business partners or advertisers.  If you expressly consent, we may share your personal information with business partners that may offer services we believe may be of interest to you.  You can control whether you would like to receive offers from our business partners through your profile page.
</p><p>
<b>For Administrative and Legal Purposes</b>
</p><p>
	Trusted Opinion may disclose your personal information to carry out a user's request, or where Trusted Opinion reasonably believes that doing so is in compliance with our legal obligations pursuant to a search warrant or subpoena, or is in Trusted Opinion's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others.  We may also disclose your personal information where Trusted Opinion reasonably believes it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, violations of Trusted Opinion's Terms of Service, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.
</p><p>
	Staff or third party suppliers or vendors of Trusted Opinion may access your personal information to assist Trusted Opinion in operating its business.  We require our vendors to have the same standard of privacy protections as we do.
</p><p>

</p><p>
In the event of a bankruptcy, sale of assets, transfer of ownership, acquisition or merger of Trusted Opinion, we may be required to disclose or transfer your information to any prospective or acquiring party.
