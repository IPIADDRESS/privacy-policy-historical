    </strong>
  </center>
<p></p>
<p>
  Welcome to Trulia! This document, our Privacy Policy, describes the types of information Trulia gathers from users of the Trulia website at www.trulia.com, our mobile website m.trulia.com, our mobile applications which you can download from <a href="/mobile/iphone/" rel="nofollow">http://www.trulia.com/mobile/iphone/</a> and the information provided by users that visit our partner
  websites and use Trulia Search. It also describes how we use that information. We refer to all of our websites as our "Sites," and all of the services and
  functionalities that we provide - including our Sites and our mobile applications - as our "Services."
</p>
<p>
  Our Privacy Policy is incorporated as part of the <a href="/terms/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Trulia Terms of Use</strong></a>. Please read this Policy
  and our Terms carefully before using our Services. By using Trulia's Services, you agree to the provisions of this policy. If you do not want to be bound
  by our Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services!
</p>
<p>
  Changes to our Policy Since May 25, 2011. Changes include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We added more information about how we categorize our users and what information we collect, use, and share.
  </li>
  <li>
    We described our new functionality of obtaining enhanced data from third parties, our Facebook Connect functionality, and our Facebook advertising
    capabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    We clarified the circumstances under which we may disclose users' information to Real Estate Professionals (REPs) and for our new mortgage product.
  </li>
  <li>
    We updated our cookie policy and further explained our use of cookies and other tracking technology to describe the specific types of cookies, beacons, and
    other technologies we use to analyze users' behavior and improve our Services.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added information about location data and our mobile Services, including how and when we collect and share location and mobile data.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added new terms to a newly added "General Matters" section to describe how you can delete your account and access your personally identifiable
    information, the fact that we do not collect children's information, and what happens to our users' data under a sale or merger.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Why We Collect Information from You</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Trulia is a real estate information service. To provide our Services, we use information we collect to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Help you find the most relevant information for your situation by customizing our Services to optimize your experience;
  </li>
  <li>
  Keep you connected with Trulia across the Internet and update you with residential real estate-related news and information, if you allow us to do so;
  </li>
  <li>
  Put you in touch with the right people to sell, buy, rent, or research residential real estate, obtain a mortgage, and to optimize the information we
  share with those parties to initiate a productive and efficient relationship.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our goal in this policy is to be completely transparent about the data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it, in order to make finding your new
  home a pleasant and fun experience!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>To Whom Does This Policy Apply?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Some parts of this Policy are directed at specific types of people. We use some special terminology to refer to them, which we define below. This Policy
  applies to everyone who uses our Services, but sometimes we direct parts of it toward particular groups of users.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Users:</u>
  "Users" are everyone who uses our Services.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Real Estate Professionals (REPs):</u>
  "Real Estate Professionals," or "REPs" are users who have created accounts (free or paid) with us to sell or rent real estate, participate in our
  advertising services, and participate in other Services that we direct toward the professional real estate community. REPs include landlords, agents,
  mortgage professionals and subscribers (described further below). We send leads to REPs on your behalf, as described in this Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Subscribers:</u>
  "Subscribers" are REPs who participate in our paid subscription plans, like Trulia Pro. Subscribers, like all REPs, get leads from us, but they also may
  receive third-party augmented information as described in this Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What Information Do We Collect, and Where Do We Get It?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <u>We Collect Some Information From All Visitors to Our Site:</u>
</p>
<p>
  Like many online services, we use technologies like session and persistent cookies, web beacons (tiny image files on web pages that communicate information
  about the page viewer to the beacon owner), log data, and third-party analytics services to collect and analyze information about all users of our Services
  This includes things like users' search preferences, interaction with ads on our Site, and location.
</p>
<p>
  Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address,
  browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device, search terms, and cookie information. We
  receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, or interact with our email
  notifications. We use Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them collect and use in the aggregate.
</p>
<p>
  Cookies are small data files that we transfer to your computer. We use "session" cookies to keep you logged in while you use our Services, to better
  understand how you interact with our Services, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic information on our Services. We use "persistent" cookies to
  recognize you each time you return to our Services. For example, we create a persistent cookie that includes some basic information about you, like your
  most recent search and whether an agent responded to a query you sent using Trulia's services. We use this persistent cookie to remember your preferences
  and, if you create an account, to make your user experience consistent after you register.
</p>
<p>
  Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your settings or use third-party tools to refuse cookies or prompt you before
  accepting cookies from the websites you visit. You can also use your browser settings or other tools to delete cookies you already have. Please be aware
  that some parts of our Services may not work for you if you disable cookies.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Information We Collect from Users with Trulia Accounts:</u>
  When using our Services, you have the option to create an account (and for some REPs, to subscribe to our premium services). If you choose to create an
  account, we ask you to provide us with some limited personal information like your name and email address. We may use this information to contact you about
  the services on our Site in which you have expressed interest, or to suggest Trulia tools and services to improve your home buying, selling or renting
  process. If your browser permits the use of cookies, we will collect and store additional information using persistent cookies, as described above, and
  associate it with your account even if you are logged out.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Information We Collect from Users that Sign On with Facebook Connect</u>
  : You can also log into Trulia using your Facebook name and password by clicking the Facebook Connect button. By using Facebook Connect, you are allowing
Trulia to access some personally identifiable information in your Facebook account pursuant to the    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Facebook Terms of Service</a>. Facebook Connect will pre-populate your Trulia account during the sign-up
  process with information from your Facebook account. Trulia will also receive your Facebook ID number during this process. We use all of this information
  strictly in accordance with this Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Information We Collect from REPs:</u>
  If you create a REP account with us, whether as a landlord, agent, or subscriber, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to set up your
  account. We ask all REPs to provide a name, a company (if available), a phone number, and an email address. We also ask agents to provide a real estate
  license number. If you create a paid REP account and become a subscriber, we require you to submit all of the information required from landlords and
  agents as well as a description of your campaign. We will also collect financial data like credit card information and billing addresses from subscribers,
  so that we can handle billing. If you are a subscriber, a Trulia representative may call you to verify your information.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Additional Information About You that We Obtain from Third Parties:</u>
  We may sometimes obtain information about you from third parties and use it to help agents serve you better. For example, our partners may help us provide
  predictions of your income range and how likely you may be to purchase a home. We will share this augmented data only with selected REPs (subscribers) who
  you choose to share information with by contacting them through the Trulia Services.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Information We Collect When You Use the Trulia Mobile Application:</u>
  When you use the Trulia mobile application, we may collect Log Data specific to your mobile device ("Mobile Log Data"), like your mobile device model, your
  operating system, your device ID, whether you are logged in or not, and information about how you use our app and mobile site, such as what properties you
  are viewing and whom you contact through the app. As explained below, we need this information in order to analyze how mobile users interact with our Site
  and Services so we can improve our Services and the ads we show you. This information is stored with your Trulia account.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Location Data:</u>
  If you provide location information (like a ZIP code, street address, or even just a city) during the registration process or at any other time via your
  account settings, we will store that information and associate it with your account.
</p>
<p>
  If you use our mobile Site or app, we will collect location data directly from your device automatically if your device allows us to do so. In some
  circumstances, you may have to opt into sharing your location data with us. Additionally, your mobile device may provide you with choices about how and
  whether location data is shared with us.
</p>
<p>
  We may use and store information about your location to provide localized features, to analyze our Services with the help of third-party analytics
  services, to provide you with relevant advertising and marketing materials, and otherwise to improve and customize our Services.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How We Share Your Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <u>Personally Identifiable Information:</u>
  We will only share your personally identifiable information at your direction (e.g., when you request to contact a REP using our Services) and according to
  this Policy's terms.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u>
  : In order to provide and improve our Services and to share relevant ads with you, we use and disclose to our advertising and analytics partners
  non-personally identifiable information that we collect, including cookie data, some log data, and mobile data. We also share anonymous profiles of users
who view a property with REPs. We will never re-identify non-personally identifiable information by combining it with personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
  Some of our Services require that you opt into additional sharing:
</p>
<p>
  <u>Direct Contact with a REP</u>
  : If you fill out a form to contact a REP (or use any other contact forms available on our Sites) or call a REP via our mobile site or app, we may share
  personally identifiable information that you share with us and information about your use of our Services with the party you wanted to contact. This may
  include data you input such as home search criteria or Log Data that we collect as you use the Services. If a REP wants to contact you based on the
  anonymized profile of Trulia pages you visited, we will contact you to see if we can make that connection. Sometimes, if we are working with a third party
  to improve the leads we provide to our subscriber REPs, we may provide that third party with additional but limited personally identifiable information for
  the sole purpose of their carrying out their duty to us.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Mortgage Services:</u>
  If you request a mortgage quote using our services, you authorize us to share the personally identifiable information necessary for our partners to deliver
  the service. They are not permitted to use the information for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Referrals:</u>
  If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically
  send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Trulia stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time
  email. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@trulia.com">customerservice@trulia.com</a> to request that we remove this information
  from our database.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Facebook Custom Audiences and Promotions:</u>
  If you have not opted out of email communications with us, we will use your email address (and Facebook ID, if we have collected it) to promote Trulia
  content to you via Facebook's Custom Audiences feature and other Facebook advertising or promotional tools. The Custom Audiences feature allows us to reach
  out to our users via Facebook if those users have already shared their email addresses or Facebook IDs with us.
</p>
<p>
  We do not allow anyone else to access the user lists we use for Facebook promotions, and Facebook itself will never receive any of our users' data.
  (Facebook receives a hash, a kind of digital fingerprint, of our users' data in order to make a match on its own servers, but they never receive any actual
  data.) If you do not want to receive promotions as part of our Custom Audiences campaigns, unsubscribe from our email list via one of the emails you
  receive from us, and we will remove you from our Custom Audiences list within 7 days.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Social Sharing:</u>
  When you use any social sharing function we may provide to share our products and Site (e.g., sharing on Facebook), your sharing activity will be processed
  through a third party's site or service. These third parties' privacy policies, not ours, govern the collection and use of the information collected on
  those sites.
</p>
<p>
  <u>User-Generated Content:</u>
  If you use our user-generated content services, like posting a question, answer or blog on this Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable
  information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for
  the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
</p>
<p>
  Professionals may add testimonials to their own profiles on Trulia. They are responsible for obtaining consent to publish any personal information of those
  persons who submit said testimonials to them.
</p>
<p>
  We may post user content, including testimonials and reviews, on our website. Some of it may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain
  customers' consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their names along with their testimonial.
</p>
<p>
If you want to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our website under public pages, please contact us at    <a href="mailto:customerservice@trulia.com">customerservice@trulia.com</a>.

<p>
      <u>Protecting Ourselves and Our Users:</u>
      We may release personal information when we believe that doing so is appropriate to comply with a legitimate law, regulation, or
      legal request; to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property; to
      protect the safety of our users; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate
      danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
</p>
<p>
  Website <u>Third-Party Ad Services:</u> We use third-party ad services to deliver ads to you on our Services. These third-party ad servers may collect and
  use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Services in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you
  would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads on our
  Sites, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Mobile Ad Networks and Analytics:</u>
  For our mobile products, we use third-party service providers for the limited purpose of helping us analyze your Mobile Log Data and location data, so that
we can improve and localize our services, show you relevant advertisements, and study the way our mobile users interact with our Sites and Services.
</p>
