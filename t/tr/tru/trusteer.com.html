      <p><span style="color: #409527;"><strong>Trusteer Privacy Policy</strong></span></p>
<p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THE TRUSTEER SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY TRUSTEER IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT USE TRUSTEER’S ON-LINE SERVICE, DOWNLOAD AND/OR INSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND PROMPTLY (within 3 days from the date you received this package) ERASE THE SOFTWARE AND ANY PART THEREOF, FROM YOUR COMPUTER AND DO NOT USE IT IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER.</p>
<p>At Trusteer Inc. and its affiliates (“Trusteer,” “our” or “we”), we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to all of the software, services and products offered by Trusteer or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, Trusteer's "Services"), and covers how personal and other information that Trusteer collects and receives, including information related to use of the Services, is treated.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at: <a href="mailto:Support@Trusteer.com">Support@Trusteer.com</a> Information we collect and how we use it:</p>
<p>In order to provide our Services, we may collect the following types of information:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Security related Information -      When you use our Services, we automatically receive and record information      from your computer and browser regarding possible security risks. This      information is collected as part of our malicious activity detection      processes and to continuously improve our ability to protect against      evolving threats and malware. Collected information includes IP address,      software and hardware attributes, and additional information related to      security events such as URLs visited which the software and services deem      potentially fraudulent and files identified as potentially related to      malicious activity. Such files and URLs may contain personally      identifiable information that a potentially fraudulent website or malware      attempt to obtain without your permission. We do not deliberately collect      personally identifiable information and we do not store or correlate any      personally identifiable information with data from your computer. We do      not track your browsing behavior.</li>
<li>Status information - When you      use the Services, our software collects status information regarding      installation and operation of the software, and information about attempts      to modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, and terminate our      Services. This information indicates to Trusteer whether installation of      the software was successfully completed and whether the software has      encountered an error. Prior to collecting such information, the software      will attempt to eliminate all personally identifiable information if such      information is included in the name of the file or folder encountered by      the software at the time of installation or error. The status information      is collected by Trusteer for the purpose of evaluating and improving      Trusteer’s product performance and installation success rate and will not      be correlated with any personally identifiable information.</li>
<li>User communications, Personal      and Contact &amp; information – In some situations, such as when you      communicate with our contact center, we may ask for contact information.      We process such information only for specific and limited purposes. We ask      only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those      purposes. When you send email or other communication to Trusteer, we may      retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to      your requests and improve our Services. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you use our products and services, we may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Trusteer may use Cookies information for activities such as automatically updating services on your system, monitoring aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed, and personalizing the services we provide you. We do not use cookies to track your browsing behaviors.</p>
<p>Trusteer uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services as well as to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you use our Rapport product, you may choose to limit the information sent to us to critical security information only (such as malware infection indications) by configuring the software appropriately through the Rapport console, although this may result in reduced protection and limited functionality.</p>
<p>Trusteer will not share, sell, auction off or give away your personal information to any third-party or other organization other than as set forth herein.</p>
<p>Links from our Site - Links to other sites may be provided by Trusteer as a convenience to our customers. Trusteer is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by us.</p>

<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected or described in this Policy, then we will notify you of the change through email or via our web site, and you will be able to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.</p>

<ul>
<li>We provide information to our      customers with whom you have an account (such as your bank) for the      purpose of protecting your account and personal information in case it has      been subject to suspected malicious activity. Such information is secured      such that it can be used only by the organization who manages your account      and who prevents malicious activity on it, and cannot be used by anyone      else including Trusteer to correlate the information with other personally      identifiable information.</li>
<li>Trusteer uses all of the      information that we collect to understand the usage trends and aggregate      preferences of our users, to improve the Services, to create new features      and functionality, and to continuously improve our ability to protect      against evolving threats and malware. In order to promote awareness,      detection and prevention of internet security risks, Trusteer may share      certain anonymous information with research organizations and other      security software vendors. Trusteer may also use statistics derived from      the information to track and publish reports on security risk trends.</li>

<li>We limit access to contact      information about you to employees, contractors and agents who we believe      reasonably need to come into contact with that information. These      individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to      discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail      to meet these obligations.</li>
<li>We have physical, electronic,      and procedural security measures and safeguards to protect personal      information. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard      security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password      protection.</li>

<p>We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.</p>
