      <h4>2.3 Personalize our advertising and communications</h4>

Such legitimate interests of Truecaller include to protect and maintain the security of the Services, to create and maintain spam blocking directories, to understand and improve our Services and user relationships and to administer our business and customer support. Where we process data based on Your consent, <u>You may withdraw your consent at any time via Your settings</u>.</p>

      <h3>5. INFORMATION SECURITY AND TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES</h3>

      <p>The Truecaller Services require by their very nature that Your personal information will be transferred to other Users across the globe. Truecaller may also use cloud based services and subcontract storage or processing of Your information to third parties located in countries other than Your home country in order to provide the Services, including e.g. the USA. Information collected within the Europe may, for example, be transferred to and processed in a country outside of Europe, which may not provide the same level of protection for personal data as within Europe. We use <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&amp;from=EN">Model Contractual Clauses</a> adopted by the EU Commission as a legal mechanism for the international transfer of data to a third party located in a country outside Europe. We take all reasonable precautions to protect personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Truecaller has implemented physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in order to protect the information, including that the information will be stored on secured servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
