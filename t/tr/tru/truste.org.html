        WatchDog page to provide you with a mechanism for reporting privacy violations, 
        misuse of the trustmark, or specific privacy concerns pertaining to a 
        member Web site. We request your name, email address, name of the Web 
        site, URL, and description of the privacy violation. This information 
        is used to look into the alleged violation to come to a satisfactory resolution. 
        Certain personally identifiable information like your name and email address 
        may be shared with the member site, but only if you indicate that we have 
        your permission to do this by marking the appropriate boxes. If you do 
        not give us your permission to share your personally identifiable information, 
        then we will not share it with anyone outside of TRUSTe. However, in some 
        cases, this may limit our ability to successfully resolve your complaint. 
        Any contact information a user provides on the WatchDog page is optional.</font></p>

        logs IP addresses and browser types for systems administration purposes 
        and these logs will be analyzed to constantly improve the value of the

      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The TRUSTe Privacy 
        Wizard was designed to help you create a privacy statement. The Wizard 
        asks for information such as company name, Web site name and contact information. 
        The information that is input into the Privacy Wizard is used to generate 
        a privacy statement, however, this information is not saved or captured 
        in any way. The Wizard directs users to address their inquiries to whoever 
        is entered as Web site administrator. Further, the privacy statement generated 
        lets users know how they can contact the Web site administrator depending 
        on what information is entered; mailing address, email address, and/or 
        phone number. Again, this information is not used or captured by TRUSTe.</font><font size="3"><b>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">TRUSTe provides its 
        visitors the option of opting-in as opposed to opting-out. Therefore, 
        when there is a choice of using information for purposes other than what 
        the information was originally collected for, TRUSTe will present the 
        user with an opt-in box. For example, when visitors go to the "enter 
        the drawing", they are presented with an opt-in box, asking if they 
        would like to receive information about TRUSTe. By default, the box is 
        NOT checked. If visitors check the box, a TRUSTe informational package 
        will be emailed to them.</font></p>
