Insofar as a membership contract exists, you may request that your data be exempt from further processing after full performance of the contract agreement, and that your data be deleted after the expiration of the tax and commercial law period of storage.

<strong>Which data is collected and used if I register for Trusted Shops Buyer Protection?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When registering for Trusted Shops Buyer Protection, you will be asked to consent to the storage, processing and use of your data by Trusted Shops GmbH. We do of course respect your decision not to grant us consent. However, in this case you will not be entitled to Trusted Shops Buyer Protection.
</p>
<p>
In order to register for Buyer Protection, we require:
</p>
<ul>
<li>your email address; </li>
<li>the name of the online shop; </li>
<li>the total purchase price;</li>
<li>the selected payment method;</li>
<li>the order number; and, in some cases, </li>
<li>the shop customer number. </li>
</ul>
<p>
During registration, we do not know which products you have ordered nor do we have access to sensitive payment information such as your credit card number or bank details.
</p>
<p>
Your data will solely be used to be able to offer you Buyer Protection and to enable you to use the Trusted Shops System. In the Trusted Shops System, you can view your active and completed purchases made under the Buyer Guarantee, make any necessary claims for refunds and rate completed transactions. Your email address is used as your user name for access to the Trusted Shops System and is only stored for the purposes of the duration of your active account / membership. Only the information and data that is absolutely necessary to clarify possible claims for refunds is saved and processed.
</p>
<p>
You can also request that your data be deleted at any time. Please use our <a href="https://www.trustedshops.com/en/contact.html">contact form</a> for this purpose. However, you will then loose the benefit of Trusted Shops Buyer Protection
</p>
<p>
In the event of a Buyer Protection claim, we require additional information and personal data from you for the purposes of verifying and processing the refund claim. When claiming a refund, your name, address and in some cases your telephone number and your bank details for reimbursement are stored. This data is then stored for six months and used solely to complete the refund claim. After this period, the data is blocked from being used for any other purposes and after the expiration of the tax and commercial law period of storage the data is permanently deleted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which data is collected and used if I submit a customer rating?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you submit a rating using the Trusted Shops customer rating system without already being registered for Trusted Shops Buyer Protection, we require your email address in order to guarantee the validity and credibility of the rating. The email address is used exclusively to verify that the rating really originates from a customer of the rated shop and can be allocated to a proven purchase, and for these purposes the email address will be stored for the life of the rating.
</p>
<p>
By clicking on "Submit Review", you grant Trusted Shops GmbH the non-exclusive right to permanently store your rating with the corresponding email address in databases as well as the right to reproduce, publish or pass on the ratings and comments, in part or in full, both online as well as offline (e.g. print media, catalogues), and the right to make them publicly accessible. Your email address will never be publicly accessible. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which data is collected and used if I write a comment?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Personal data (email address, name) is collected if you voluntarily agree to this when commenting on an article. We use the data you choose to supply solely for the publication of your comment.
