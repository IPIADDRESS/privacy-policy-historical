<p></p><h2>Trustedplaces Privacy Policy </h2>(<em>last  updated: 13 July 2006</em>) <br><br>
  Welcome to trustedplaces, and  congratulations for clicking on our Privacy Policy, you are probably one of the  very few people who have decided to read them, and we thank you for that!<p></p>
  
<p>Trustedplaces has developed this Privacy  Policy in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to the privacy of your data.  We’ve read 1984 by George Orwell and don’t like the idea of “big brother” so we  strongly believe that your personal data should stay private. All our  activities with reference to your data are governed by the Data Protection Act  1998. </p>

<p>Trustedplaces is committed to safeguarding  the privacy of your data whilst providing you with a personalised, fun, and  valuable service. This Privacy Policy explains when and how personal  information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to  trustedplaces. By using trustedplaces, you consent to the privacy practices  described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. Please carefully  revise this Policy periodically to review any changes made to it.</p>

<p><strong>What is Personal  Information?</strong><br>
  Personal information is  defined as information that specifically identifies an individual such as a  username, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account  number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked  to that person such as information about his or her use of trusteplaces.  Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of  birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked  to other personal information that identifies you. Essentially personal  information is what makes you unique and special ;-)</p>
  
<p>Personal information  does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is  data we collect about a group or category of places, products, services or  customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In  other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and  combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data  helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider  new features or otherwise tailor trustedplaces. </p>

<p><strong>Personal Information We  Collect</strong> <br>
  We collect personal  information in a number of ways when you visit our web site. For example, we  collect personal information when you: </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>register  and set up an account; </li>
  <li>sign up to  any of our e-mail newsletters; </li>
  <li>discussion  topics you create in our “discussion forum”; </li>
  <li>post a  review or; </li>
  <li>contact us  by e-mail for any reason. </li>
</ul>

<p>When you visit our web  site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's  Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser  type, the address of a referring web site, and timestamp. We treat this  information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of  the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the  aggregate only. </p>

<p><strong>How We Use Personal  Information?</strong> <br>

  In general, we use personal information to process your requests  and provide you with service or to inform you about other products or services  we think will be of interest. When we use personal information in our marketing  efforts, we provide you with options (See Controlling Your Personal Information  below) and do not disclose the information to third parties except as described  in this Policy. Personal information provided online may be linked together or  merged with other personal information so that we may better understand your  needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our partners.  In addition, if we receive information from third parties with whom we have  business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal  information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this  information.</p>
  
<p>Browser-type related  information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help  us diagnose problems with our server, administer trustedplaces, and otherwise  provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this  information to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and  characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of  the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of  users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.</p>

<p>Additionally  trustedplaces uses the information obtained from cookies (see the Cookies  section below) for several purposes. The cookies enable us to understand your  own personal preferences and tailor your experience on trustedplaces by using  those preferences. Trustedplaces also uses cookies to track user trends and  patterns. The information which trustedplaces receives from cookies enables us  to modify and improve trustedplaces to meet the needs of our users, including  you.</p>

<p>When users provide trustedplaces with registration information  such as name, email address and postal address, this data can be matched with  cookie data, if cookies have been set to be received. This means trustedplaces  is able to match an identifiable user with specific usage of trustedplaces.  This information would be used by trustedplaces only.</p>

<p><strong>Content, Reviews, and Ratings</strong> <br>
  You can publish  reviews, comments, ratings on all sorts of content on trustedplaces, whether  the content was created by you, in conjunction with other users, or simply by  other users. Members can choose to rate places or other reviews, and to connect  to other members.</p>
  
<p>Your reviews are displayed  publicly unless you change the default configuration. Your username is  automatically displayed with reviews, ratings and comments you publish, and if  other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your  publications or publish their own comments and ratings to your reviews.</p>

<p>We use your reviews to  personalise the site and identify/feature popular members. For example, we may  promote most popular reviews and members. While we don't expect to transfer the  complete review and member database to others, we use the database throughout  our networks and to generate results for others.</p>

<p><strong>Controlling your  Personal Information</strong><br>
  You should be aware  that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g.,  username, e-mail address) via reviews, comments, messages, discussion forums,  postings, or in other areas of the trustedplaces, that information, along with  any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected  and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages  from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of  trustedplaces. Please do not post any personal information on trusteplaces or  in other areas that you expect to keep private.</p>
  
<p>As a registered  trusteplaces user, you can modify your personal information at any time by  accessing the "Edit Profile" section of the site. If you do not want  to receive e-mail from us you can change your notification settings within the  “My Profile” section of the site. Also, upon your request, trusteplaces will  use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally remove you and your  personal information from the site; however, it may be impossible to remove  your entry without some residual information being retained by trusteplaces.  Registered users who wish to close their account should contact <a href="mailto:admin@trusteplaces.com">admin@trusteplaces.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing of  Personal Information</strong><br>
  We do not sell, rent or  share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except  in the limited circumstances described in this policy. We may share personal  information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing functions  necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, without  limitation, Website hosting, credit card transaction processing and data entry.  We limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which we  believe is necessary to carry out those functions. Moreover, we require them to  comply with our privacy practices, and not to use the information for other  purposes except as required by law.</p>
  
<p>In addition, we may  disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully  authorised to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with  legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights,  property or personal safety of trustedplaces, our users, our employees or the  public. Information about our users, including personal information, may be  disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger,  sale of company assets or acquisition but they will be legally bound to keep  the information secure and only to use it consistent with this policy in the  event of the deal proceeding. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose  personal information when posting reviews or other content onto trustedplaces,  this information may be collected and used by others. You agree that we bear no  responsibility for any such disclosures. We recommend you be cautious in giving  out personal information to others in public online forums.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  Cookies are small text  files that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser and  identify you as a unique user. This allows you a more personalised service when  you revisit us. The cookie allows us to find out about your last visit.&nbsp; We use cookies to refine our site and  simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered  users to enter our site without explicitly typing in their username/email  address and password every time.</p>
  
<p>Most browsers accept  cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser  to prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. If you’d prefer, you can set  your browser to refuse cookies (details can be found at <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">www.aboutcookies.org</a>). You should be  aware that if you choose not to receive our cookies, we cannot guarantee that  our website will be as functional as if you do receive cookies. </p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
  Trustedplaces is concerned for the security  of data. Your trustedplaces account is password-protected. To protect the  confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password  confidential.</p>
  
<p>Trustedplaces tries very hard to protect  our users’ information. We use industry standard measures to protect your information that is stored within our  database. We limit the access to your information to those employees who need  access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel.  Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorised  disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable  information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is  inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Trustedplaces is constantly reviewing  the security measures required to prevent third parties or any unauthorised  identity from accessing any data that it holds.</p>

<p><strong>Global Access to Personal Information</strong><br>
  Please be aware that if  you do post personal information on our website it is accessible worldwide  including in countries that do not have adequate data protection laws by EU  standards.</p>
  
<p><strong>Links to Other  Websites</strong> <br>
  Links from our website  to third parties or to other sites are provided for your convenience.&nbsp; Any personal information you provide on the  linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that  third party's privacy policy, so we are not responsible for the content or  privacy and security practices and policies of websites to which we link and we  recommend you read them before disclosing any personal information. </p>
  
<p><strong>Your Comments or  Concerns</strong><br>
  We always welcome  feedback from our users. If you have any comments or concerns about this  privacy policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us at <a href="mailto:info@trustedplace.com">info@trustedplaces.com</a>.</p>
  
<p><strong>Terms and  Modification to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  By using the website,  you signify your agreement to the terms of our Privacy Policy. &nbsp;Trustedplaces may modify this Privacy Policy  at any time and you should check our Privacy Policy periodically to ensure that  you are aware of any changes to it since your continued use of website is  deemed to constitute your consent to any changes to it.</p>
