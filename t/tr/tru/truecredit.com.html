		<b>The Information We Collect from You</b><br>
		TrueCredit allows you to access your credit report and related information conveniently and affordably through our Web site. We collect your personal information only if you decide to purchase one of our products or services, participate in our affiliate program, subscribe to our newsletter, participate in one of our contests or surveys or transact other business with us. In order to process your transactions and provide you with quality customer service, we need your full name and current and/or billing address, your email address (so we can contact you) and, if you purchase one of our products or services, a valid credit card number, your Social Security number and certain other personal information, such as your date of birth, address information, employment information, and certain credit card and loan account information. We use personal information to authenticate the credit card number and to confirm that the person requesting your credit report really is you and not an impostor or other person improperly seeking to access your information. 
		</p><p>
		<b>What Security Measures We Take </b><br>
		TrueCredit takes precautions to secure your personal information. If and when we ask you to provide your personal information, we will do so through a Web page that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This protocol provides security for your information by encrypting it as it travels from your computer to our computer. We then move all of the personal information that we collect or obtain about you, including your credit report, to a special computer for security purposes by means of a one-way transfer on our proprietary network. This special computer is not connected to the Internet, and TrueCredit has controls in place to limit access to and secure the data maintained therein. For more information about our security practices, please review our Security Policy at <a href="http://www.truecredit.com/policy/security.jsp" name="/policy/security.jsp" onclick="nextpage=true">http://www.truecredit.com/policy/security.jsp</a>.

		<b>How We Use and Share Your Personal Information </b><br>
		If you indicate to us that you are interested in receiving information regarding other products 
		and services your name and e-mail address may be shared with a third party in order to present 
		these offers to you. Personal information that is shared with these entities will be monitored in 
		accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. If you prefer not to receive such 
		information, you may indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box when you register, 
		place an order or update your account information, and TrueCredit will not send you any promotional 
		materials.

		<p><b>The Collection of Anonymous Data</b><br>
		In order to enhance the usefulness of our Web site and our products and services, TrueCredit will collect data about our customers' use of our Web site, in a manner that does not include any personally identifiable information. While you browse the TrueCredit Web site, we note which pages of our site you visit and note the IP address of your computer (as all Web sites do automatically), but we do not link that address information to your personal information. The general information we gather enables us to serve our customers better by continually enhancing our site based on up-to-date use patterns.

		<b>Updating Your Personal Information and Email Preferences</b><br>
		You can correct or update at any time the personal information that you provided and that we maintain on you by accessing the TrueCredit Web site and selecting "Account Preferences" from the Main Menu. You can also indicate your preference not to receive promotional email from this screen. TrueCredit is not responsible for and cannot amend the information in your credit report, which is produced by one or more credit reporting agencies. If you believe that some of the information in your credit report is inaccurate, you must contact the applicable credit reporting agency directly. Information on how to contact the credit reporting agency will be contained in the credit report that you receive if you purchase. In addition, Information about how to contact the three major credit reporting agencies is available under "Disputing Your Credit Information" on our Web site at <a href="http://www.truecredit.com/help/handlingInaccuracies.jsp" name="/help/handlingInaccuracies.jsp" onclick="nextpage=true">http://www.truecredit.com/help/handlingInaccuracies.jsp</a>.

		<b>TrueCredit Newsletter</b><br>
		You may sign up for our free monthly newsletter in one of two ways. First, you may enter your email address in the " Free

		Newsletter" field, you can opt-out of receiving the email by responding to the newsletter and asking to be unsubscribed, or calling our customer service department and asking to be taken off the list. If you signed up for our newsletter by selecting the special offers opt-in box during the ordering process, you may unsubscribe through the above two processes, or you may go to www.truecredit.com, log-in as a member, click on the "Account Preferences" link, and de-select the special offers opt-in box.
