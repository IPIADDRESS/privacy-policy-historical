(collectively referred to as the "Website"), you
<strong>accept</strong> the processing of your personal data (the
"Policy") as described in this Policy.</p>

<p>We recommend that you <strong>print</strong> and

aware that depending on the information you provide, you may or may
not be anonymous.</p>

out.</p>

</ul>

<p>We may also use the information in other ways for which we
provide specific notice at the time of collection. We may use or
disclose information that is not personal information for any
purpose to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h3>2 &nbsp;Disclosure of personal information</h3>

<p>2.1 &nbsp;Disclosure of personal information on the Website</p>

<p>Your acceptance of this Policy also implies consent to disclose
information about you on the Website. This includes your username,
which may reveal your identity in full or in part - unless you have
chosen to use a pseudonym.</p>

<p>We recommend that you exercise care in deciding which
information to make available for disclosing on the Website, and be
aware that depending on the level of information provided, you may
or may not be anonymous.</p>

<p>Master Data</p>

<p>When you write a review on our Website and create a profile,
your username will be visible to other users of the Website.</p>

<p>Other information</p>

<p>Other information provided by you on the Website, including
photos and reviews, is automatically made visible on the Website.
The companies you review may also receive information about your
review.</p>

<p>Geo-location</p>

<p>When you make a contribution to the Website, we use your
computer's IP address (see section 1.4 of this Policy) to
approximate your location to the nearest city. This is made
available to other users of the Website.</p>

<p>Social Networks</p>

<p>If you connect to a Social Network, information such as your
profile photo, your name, birth year and approximate location will
be collected from your Social Network profile and used to identify
you on the Website. Subject to privacy settings and the level of
information available from the Social Network, users of the Website
may be able to use this information to identify which reviews you
have written.</p>

<p>If you have chosen to preserve anonymity by using a pseudonym
for your Trustpilot username, be aware that information from Social
Network(s) may reveal your identity in part or in full and make it
possible to identify which reviews you have written.</p>

<p>If your contacts or your contact's contacts (jointly referred to
as "Connections") on the Social Network have also connected with
Trustpilot, we may display on the Website how you are connected to
these Connections through the Social Network.</p>

<p>2.2 &nbsp;Disclosure on services to which you connect your
profile</p>

<p>If you choose to connect your Trustpilot profile with profiles
on a Social Network, information and reviews provided by you on the
Website or data compiled by us about your use of the service on the
Website (e.g. the number of reviews you have written) will be
shared with and displayed in connection with your profile on the
Social Network and will be subject to the privacy policy of the
Social Network.</p>

<p>2.3 &nbsp;Disclosure to other services and companies</p>

<p>One of Trustpilot's main goals is to increase the exposure and
availability of reviews on the Website. We therefore permit other
services to show reviews created on the Website. This increases the
potential audience for your reviews.</p>

<p>The categories of third party services and companies to which
the information is disclosed are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Search engines, including Google and Bing.</li>

<li>Companies reviewed on Trustpilot.</li>

<li>Consumer portals and business portals, including price
comparison websites, shopping guides etc.</li>

<li>Application partners and platforms, such as Magento, Shopify,
WooCommerce. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Other similar websites where, in Trustpilot's assessment, it
will be relevant for users to search for reviews.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you submit your review, it is published on the Website.
This means that the following information is disclosed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your review(s), (see section 1.2),</li>

<li>Your username and, if uploaded, a profile photo as well as user
demographics such as gender, and</li>

<li>Your location (approximated to the closest city).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you write a review on Trustpilot in response to an invitation
sent by a company via Trustpilot's invitation services, the company
who sent you the invite will be able to link your review with the
invitation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If we need to verify your review, we may contact you and ask for
documentation that shows that you have had a Service Experience
with the company that you have reviewed. We therefore recommend
that you keep such documentation for 12 months from the date of
your review. We explain the type of documentation you should send
us here: <a href="https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201839083-What-does-Trustpilot-look-for-in-a-Proof-of-Purchase-" target="_blank">support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201839083-What-does-Trustpilot-look-for-in-a-Proof-of-Purchase-</a></p>

<p>We do not share the documentation you send to us with the
reviewed company. However, we may pass on your reference number to
the company, unless you ask us not to.</p>

<p>2.4 &nbsp;Other disclosures</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we may disclose your personal
information to the following parties and in the following
circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>To allow third party vendors, consultants and other service
providers to perform services on our behalf.</li>

<li>To Trustpilot subsidiaries and other companies within the
Trustpilot group of companies.</li>

<li>To comply with laws or to respond to claims, legal process
(including but not limited to subpoenas and court orders) and
requests from public and government authorities.</li>

<li>To cooperate with regulatory bodies and government authorities,
including but not limited to Trading Standards, The Competition and
Markets Authority, and the Danish Consumer Ombudsman, in connection
with investigations or case referrals. &nbsp;</li>

<li>To third parties in connection with enforcement of our <a end-user-terms-and-conditions"="" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</li>

<li>To third parties in order for us to protect our operations or
those of our affiliates.</li>

<li>To third parties in order for us to pursue available remedies,
or limit damages that we may sustain.</li>

<li>To third parties in order for us to investigate, prevent or
take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities,
including but not limited to fraud and misuse of our Website.</li>

<li>To a third party in the event of any reorganisation, merger,
acquisition, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of all or any portion of our business or assets
(including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar
proceedings).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3 &nbsp;Data controller</h3>

<p>3.1 &nbsp;Information for which we are the data controller</p>

<p>We are the data controller of the Master Data you enter in
connection with your creation of a profile, which includes but is
not limited to your name, password and email address, as well as
the registration of your IP address.</p>

<p>We are also the data controller of the information which is
disclosed to other services (see section 2.3). Danish data
protection laws govern collection of data by Trustpilot.</p>

<p>3.2 &nbsp;Information for which you are the data controller</p>

<p>You are the data controller for the content you choose to
disclose on the Website, and for the data disclosed when you
connect your Social Network profile(s) with your profile on the
Website.</p>

<h3>4 &nbsp;Links to websites</h3>

<p>Our Website contains links to other websites. Our inclusion of
such links does not imply our endorsement of those websites. We do
not control the content of those third party websites, and assume
no responsibility for the third party or their policies or
practices.</p>

<p>We encourage you to review privacy policies for these third
party websites because their procedures for collecting, handling
and processing personal data may be different from ours.</p>

<h3>5 &nbsp;Data processor and transfer of personal information
outside the EU</h3>

<p>We use external companies for maintaining the technical
operation of the Website and our services. These companies are data
processors for the personal data for which we are the data
controller. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may also
allow the data for which you are the data controller to be
processed by the same data processors.</p>

<p>The data processors must act solely in accordance with
instructions from us. By accepting the Policy, you authorise us to
give such instructions to the data processors to process data in
accordance with the Policy and for the purpose of using the
Website.</p>

<p>The data processors have taken reasonable technical and
organisational measures to protect against the information being
accidentally or illegally destroyed, lost or deteriorated, and to
protect against the information being disclosed to unauthorised
persons, being misused, or in other ways being processed in
violation of the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data
(Persondataloven). On your request - and possibly in return for
possible remuneration at the data processors' applicable hourly
rates at any time for such work - the data processors must supply
you with sufficient information to demonstrate that the
above-mentioned technical and organisational safety measures have
been taken.</p>

<p>Some of these data processors and third party services are
located outside of the European Union, such as in the US. You
consent to us using data processors in unsecure third countries
provided that there is a legal framework governing the transfer of
your personal data, for example if the company is part of the EU-US
Privacy Shield framework.</p>

<h3>6 &nbsp;Security measures</h3>

<p>We seek to use reasonable organisational, technical and
administrative measures to protect your personal information within
our organisation and we regularly audit our system for
vulnerabilities. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure
environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of
information you transmit to Trustpilot. Emails sent via the Website
are not encrypted, and we therefore advise you not to include any
confidential information in your emails to us.</p>
