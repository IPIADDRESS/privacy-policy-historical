				<h2 class="g-font-size-24 g-font-weight-300 text-green-dark" id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h2>

				<strong class="g-font-weight-700">Connecting With The TruGreen Applications And Information Provided By You</strong>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">When You Register or Otherwise Contact Us.</strong> When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for or order our Products and Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about TruGreen using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Registration Information.</strong> We will collect personal information from you if you register with the TruGreen Applications and/or place an order for our Products or Services, which may include, but is not limited to, name, address, phone number(s), email address(es), personal interest preferences, and any other information about you we consider relevant ("Personal Information").

TruGreen reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, any user access to the TruGreen Applications and/or our Products and Services without notice for any or no reason.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Financial Information.</strong> Financial information is information that you provide to us, including your debit or credit card number and related billing information (collectively, the “Billing Information”). We require such financial information in order to process payment for the purchase of a Product or Service that you have requested. <strong class="g-font-weight-700">By submitting your financial information, you consent to our providing it to those Authorized Third Party Service Providers (as later defined) as necessary to support and process your transactions as well as your credit card issuer/banking institution for their purposes. </strong></p>
				<strong class="g-font-weight-700">We ask that you do not enter financial information into your profile, except in the fields provided for that information.</strong>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Facebook.</strong> You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the TruGreen Applications and/or our Products and Services, or take advantage of other features of the TruGreen Applications. When you comment on the TruGreen Applications using your Facebook username and password and clicking "allow" on the Facebook permission authorization screen, we will automatically import whatever information that you allow to be imported from your Facebook profile based upon your privacy settings at Facebook, such as your location, your interests, etc. (collectively, "Permitted Facebook Profile Content") and you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Permitted Facebook Profile Content, including syncing access to such Permitted Facebook Profile Content when you are not using TruGreen Applications and we may share that information with other users.

Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, TruGreen. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when posting or otherwise participating on the Communication Services. If you post content, such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that TruGreen Application or Communication Services and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.</p>
				<strong class="g-font-weight-700">Information Collected Through Technology</strong>

				<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our TruGreen Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our Product and Service providers to coordinate and record the activity and fill your requests for our Products and Services and information ("Usage Information"). We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our TruGreen Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the TruGreen Applications (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the TruGreen Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our TruGreen Applications and the website you visit after you leave our TruGreen Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the TruGreen Applications.</p>

				<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s). These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers. For example, when you visit TruGreen Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s). Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the AHS Applications. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with TruGreen Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with TruGreen Applications.</p>

				<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. “Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided. “Flash” cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.</a> If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the TruGreen Applications may not function properly. For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.</p>

				<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the AHS Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access the AHS Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the AHS Applications and promotions.</p>

				<p>We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the TruGreen Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the TruGreen Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

				<p>We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsers' cookie files. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>

				<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about TruGreen Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
				<strong class="g-font-weight-700">Information You Provide About a Third Party </strong>

				<p>If you send someone else a communication from the TruGreen Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the TruGreen Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
				<strong class="g-font-weight-700">Information We Collect From Third Parties</strong>

				<p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, our Products and Services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>
				<strong class="g-font-weight-700">Third Party Analytic Technologies</strong>

				<p>We use third parties’ analytic tools to better understand who is using the TruGreen Applications, how people are using the TruGreen Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the TruGreen Applications and its content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet or help us serve more targeted advertising to you. Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the TruGreen Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited. They might combine information they collect from your interaction with TruGreen Applications with personal information they collect from other sources. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to review your options for opting out of their use of such devices.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Transactional Communications.</strong> We may send you notices from time to time relating to your account or your orders. These may include order confirmations, invoices, renewals or customer service notifications. We may also send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so; for instance, if our Service(s) is/are temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a Product is delayed or there is some service issue with something you may have ordered. You may not opt-out of receiving these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We may use third party service providers (“Authorized Third Party Service Providers”) to help us operate our business and the TruGreen Applications or administer activities on our behalf.

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Electronic Promotional Offers.</strong> We may send you promotional emails regarding special offers about our Products and Services or on behalf of third party marketing partners who we think can offer services and products of interest to you.

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Third Party Tracking and Advertising.</strong> We may allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit the TruGreen Applications. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (i.e. click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the TruGreen Applications and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about advertisers' use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept the cookies used to track your activities, you can go to www.networkadvertising.org.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Co-branded Areas.</strong> Certain areas on our TruGreen Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties such as advertisers which provide products and services or rewards programs (“Co-Branded Areas”). Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you elect to register for the products and/or our Products and Services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your Personal Information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and our Products and Services directly with you. Your Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company with whom you establish a relationship. You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third party sponsors or advertisers to learn more about their privacy practices.</p>

				<h2 class="g-font-size-24 g-font-weight-300 text-green-dark" id="important-disclosures">Important disclosures, practices and contact information</h2>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Links to other Website(s) and Communities.</strong> To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third party website(s) and communities, you should be aware that these external or third party website(s) and communities are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of each such website and community to determine how your personal information will be utilized by their proprietors.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Security.</strong> We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To guard your information delivered to us electronically, the TruGreen Applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the TruGreen Applications, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

				<p>We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Special Notice to California Residents.</strong> Customers residing in California who have submitted Personal Information to us may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. All requests for disclosure information must be submitted to us at <a href="mailto:customercare@trugreenmail.com">customercare@trugreenmail.com</a> . Within 30 days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. As of the date of this Privacy Policy, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” requests.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">A Note to International Users.</strong> The TruGreen Applications are operated in the United States and intended for U.S. residents only. &nbsp;If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please do not provide your personal information.&nbsp; If you do provide your information, be aware that information we collect will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States.

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Children's Privacy.</strong> The TruGreen Applications are generally intended for general adult audiences and are not directed or intended for children under 13 years of age but TruGreen does have some webpages accessible from our TruGreen Applications which are intended for parents and educators to use with children under 13 years of age, such as mybotanicplanet.com. No personally identifiable information is collected from these webpages. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 13 years of age on any of the TruGreen Applications. If you are under 13 years of age, you should not register or provide Personal Information on the TruGreen Applications.

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Changes to the Privacy Policy.</strong> We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the AHS Applications, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of the Policy. We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new TruGreen Applications or Communication Services or change existing ones. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your Personal Information, you will know because the Effective Date of the Privacy Policy will change. By accessing the TruGreen Applications and/or purchasing our Products and Services after the Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to our then-current Privacy Policy for information captured after the Effective Date of that Privacy Policy.</p>

				<p><strong class="g-font-weight-700">Disputes.</strong> If you choose to visit the TruGreen Applications your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of the United States and the State of Tennessee.</p>
