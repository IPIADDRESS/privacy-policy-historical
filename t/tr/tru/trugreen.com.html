                    Information The TruGreen Companies collects and how it is used</h2>
                The TruGreen Companies collects certain information to enable you to take full advantage
                of our offerings when you register at our site, order products or services, participate
                in our contests, surveys, promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate with
                us. If you choose, you can visit The TruGreen Companies without providing us with
                any information about yourself. The TruGreen Companies collects both personally
                identifiable and non-personally identifiable information from users of its website.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
                When you register with The TruGreen Companies, we require you to give us contact
                information (such as your name, e-mail address, and physical address).<br>
                <br>
                We may require additional information for specific promotions or contests run on
                our site.<br>
                <br>
                We use the customer contact information we collect to connect you with a service
                provider, and to send you, if you so choose, information about our company, newsletters,
                promotional materials, and information from the service provider network.<br>
                <br>
                We may also use the information we collect, in combination with outside records,
                to notify you about important changes to the website, new TruGreen Companies services
                and products, and special offers and information we think you'll find valuable.
                We may send you information in conjunction with third-party partners that we think
                is relevant to your interests.<br>
                <br>
                We use information gathered at the time of purchase to process your order, to enable
                the provider to fulfill your order, and to notify you of your order status. A customer
                care representative or service provider may contact you in order to fulfill a service
                you purchased or to provide information you requested.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Non-personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
                We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you when you
                visit our site, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet
                Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, the referring site from which
                you came (e.g., a partner site), and the domain name of your internet service provider
                (e.g., America Online, EarthLink).<br>
                <br>
                We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect in the aggregate
                to improve the design and content of our site. We also use this information to analyze
                site usage.<br>

                <h2>
                    Disclosure of information to outside parties</h2>
                To process your requests for products or services, we will need to share some of
                the personally identifiable information you provided (e.g., contact information
                and information about particular service needs) with service providers in the provider
                network.<br>
                <br>
                If you choose to receive promotions, newsletters, and/or other types of correspondence
                from us, the correspondence that you receive will originate from The TruGreen Companies
                or the provider network, and your personally identifiable information will continue
                to be solely maintained by The TruGreen Companies.<br>
                <br>
                If you registered with The TruGreen Companies through a third-party website or if
                you registered with a third-party website through The TruGreen Companies, we may
                need to report certain information to that website, as is necessary.<br>
                <br>
                If you come to The TruGreen Companies via a co-branded partner and transact business
                with us, the information you provide may be collected and used by The TruGreen Companies,
                as well as by the co-branded partner from which you came. The TruGreen Companies
                is not responsible for the use that the co-branded partner makes with this information.<br>
                <br>
                To help you identify when you are on The TruGreen Companies website, we place our
                logo in the upper left corner to indicate that you are within our website.<br>
                <br>
                The TruGreen Companies may be obligated to disclose personally identifiable information
                to law enforcement or agencies, even though such agencies may not comply with the
                terms of our privacy policy. The TruGreen Companies will disclose information to
                such agencies in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that
                the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or a law
                enforcement agency's request.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, The TruGreen Companies may provide aggregate statistics about our customers,
                sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors,
                partners, service providers, or to the press. Aggregate statistics contain only
                non-personally identifiable information.<br>
