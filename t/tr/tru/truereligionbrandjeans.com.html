                <p>In order to ensure that your experience on the Site is as enjoyable as possible and so that we can focus on doing what we do best, we may partner with trusted companies who specialize in technical things like online order fulfillment and web design.   We have partnered with an eCommerce service provider to operate this Site pursuant to certain agreements with us.

                <p>We want you to know that we take the privacy, security and confidentiality of your information, including any personally identifiable information ("Personal Data" or "PII") extremely seriously.  Accordingly, we take all commercially practicable and available precautions to ensure the security and confidentiality of that information.  We also want you to know what information we collect, why and how we will treat it once collected.  Finally, we want you to be able to have control over your Personal Data so that if you need to update or to correct your information or want to opt-out of receiving certain communications, you can do that easily.  In short, this Privacy Policy is for you.  Please read it carefully.</p>
                <p>Please also be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to Personal Data provided to or gathered by the Site and, where applicable, through our Customer Service Department in connection with this Site, and do not necessarily describe or reflect our information collection and sharing practices with respect to information gathered through other websites that we may operate or through other off-line means.</p>

                </p>
                <p><strong>What Information Is Collected?</strong></p>
                <p>While not necessarily personally identifiable, we may collect and store information that you provide to us via the Site or that you provide to our Customer Service Department, as further described below.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>In order to purchase any merchandise from the Site, you may check out as a Guest or register by creating an account.  To create an account, you must provide a current email address and a password of your choosing.  Regardless of whether you register by creating an account, check out as a Guest or if you merely browse the Site, we may request information about you in certain circumstances and collect certain information automatically (see immediately below).  The Personal Data we may collect includes, without limitation, your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date.  This information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations (or other transactional information) and/or to provide customer service.  This information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features.  We also may obtain, collect and aggregate information (including Personal Data) provided to us by our marketing service providers and other vendors.  That information may include information on current subscribers or customers, and is used for a number of things including enabling us to send you the most relevant, timely and exciting offers and announcements specifically tailored for you and your interests.  Of course, you can update your information or change your preferences regarding receiving announcements and other information from us at any time by accessing your account via the Site.  (For more information, see below section entitled <i>How Can I Access, Correct and Update My Personal Information</i>?)</p>
                <p><strong>2. Non-Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>You do not need to create an account with us to use the Site.  When you use the Site, including by browsing our merchandise and/or contacting us with inquiries, we collect certain non-identifiable information ("Non-Personal Data").  The Non-Personal Data we collect includes, without limitation, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet browser information, other characteristics of your device and software, domain names of your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your approximate geographic location, a record of your usage of the Services, the time of your usage and aggregated Personal Data that cannot be used to specifically identify you.  Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot, in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you.  This information is used to analyze and to improve this Site and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.  We also may receive certain Non-Personal Data (including, without limitation, of the types set forth above) from various third parties.  The Non-Personal Data we receive from third parties may be combined with the information we collect as specified herein.</p>
                <p><u>Cookies and Other Session Identifiers:</u></p>
                <p>Like many sites, we utilize a technology called "cookies".  A cookie is a piece of information that is placed on your browser when you access the Site.  In many cases, the information collected using cookies (and related technologies) are used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Data.   For example, we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Site and to understand traffic and usage patterns.  In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Data.  In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we use that information.  Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive geo-location data or information, we may collect that information automatically.</p>
                <p>Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.  For instance, the Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site during future visits.  We use cookies to monitor and to maintain information about your use of the site. Cookies are also used to track the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to visiting this Site; other than that, we do not track information about your use of other Web sites.  Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves the Site without checking out.  Cookies are not used on the Site to store your account information as this information is stored securely on the Site's server.  When you log in at the Site with your username and password, we will assign you a secure session id.  The server then passes your information to you through this secure session id.  Cookies may be session cookies (i.e., last only for one browser session) or persistent cookies (i.e., continue in your browser until they are deleted or expire).</p>
                <p>While we recommend that you leave cookies turned on as they allow you to take advantage of some of the features of the Site, you have the ability to control the use and moderation of our cookies.  However, if you elect not to allow cookies to be placed as provided herein, you may not be able to use or to enjoy all of the services and features of the Site.  Specifically, you can configure the settings (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies, (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies.  Please refer to your web browser's help section for information on how to do this.</p>
                <p><u>Aggregated Personal Data:</u> In an ongoing effort to better understand and to serve the users of the Site, we (either directly or working in concert with our marketing services providers) may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that has been provided or received by us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information does not identify you personally and is classified and treated as Non-Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><u>Other Sites, Including Social Media Platforms:</u></p>
                <p>If you use a social media platform or your mobile device (or other method of communication) to interact with the Site, that platform or application may have a specific privacy statement that governs the use of Personal Data related to it.  For example, if you use a mobile application and your mobile device's settings allow it, we may collect Mobile Location Information from your device.  Our application may be designed to collect information even if you are not logged into the application or the Site.  If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p>
                <p><strong>How Can I Access, Correct and Update My Personal Information?</strong></p>
                <p>You can access, correct and/or update certain personal information that you have provided to us by clicking on "Update Account" within the "My Account" area of the Site.</p>
                <p><strong>How Do We Use the Information Collected?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1. Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>We are not in the business of selling Personal Data.  We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.  We do not share with others, or sell or rent to others, any Personal Data provided to us through the Site or through our Customer Service Department, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.  We may use Personal Data only in the following ways:</p>
                <p><u>Access and Use:</u> If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the Site or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to or use of the Site or functionality and to monitor your use of the Site or specific functionalities.</p>
                <p><u>Internal Business Purposes:</u> We may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes including, without limitation to, help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users, to improve the Site, to protect against, identify or address fraudulent activities, to manage your account and to provide you with customer service and to generally manage the Site and our business.</p>
                <p><u>Marketing:</u> We may use your Personal Data to contact you for certain marketing and advertising purposes, including, without limitation, to inform you about offers, contests or surveys which may be of interest to you and to display content and advertising on or off the Site which may be of relevance to you.  If you wish to change or update your PII or to change your subscription preferences, you may do so as provided herein.</p>
                <p><u>Specific Reason:</u> If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided.  For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or to attempt to resolve your issue and will respond to the email address from which the contact came.</p>
                <p><u>Business Transfers:</u> As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell, buy, transfer or otherwise acquire or dispose of certain businesses or corporate assets.  In the event of such or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of us and/or our eCommerce service provider will continue to have the right to use your Personal Data and other information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.  We will ensure that any successor or acquirer will treat your Personal Data as securely and confidentially as we do.</p>
                <p><u>Subsidiaries and Affiliates:</u> We may also share your Personal Data with our subsidiaries and/or affiliates consistent with this Privacy Policy.  Our subsidiaries and affiliates will be bound to treat and to maintain any Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><u>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</u> As noted above with respect to our eCommerce service provider, we, like many businesses, sometimes engage other companies to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf so that we can focus on our core business.  Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, Web site evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing.  In connection with services those partners provide for us, we may provide or otherwise give them access to certain Personal Data, but we authorize them to use this information only in connection with the services they are retained to perform.  We employ a thorough vetting process to ensure that our partners adhere to exacting data security and privacy standards. We may also share such information with other marketers whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. If you prefer we do not share your PII with others, please email us at <a href="mailto:optout@truereligionbrandjeans.com">optout@truereligionbrandjeans.com</a>.</p>
                <p><u>Legal Requirements:</u> We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of other customers or users, (iii) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public or (iv) to protect against legal liability as determined in our discretion.</p>
                <p><u>Other uses:</u> If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not specified herein, we will inform you of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain your consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use.  In short, we will honor the choices you've made regarding your Personal Data and will inform you about any other intended uses of such information.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Non-Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>As noted above, Non-Personal Data does not and cannot be used to personally identify you.  We may use such information for any lawful purpose, including sharing non-personal information with our marketing partners, advertisers and others from time to time.  Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited the Site during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through the Site. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.</p>
                <p><strong>What Steps Are Taken To Keep My Information Secure?</strong></p>
                <p>We have implemented information security measures that contain administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard Personal and Non-personal Data.   Even though we have taken and will continue to take significant steps to protect this information, no company, including us, can fully eliminate all security risks associated with PII.</p>
                <p>We use various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, to protect information collected, transferred and retained.  If you elect to set up an account on the Site, you will be asked to provide an email address and password.  You must provide a valid email address and password in order to create and maintain an account, as well as to access account information.  We recommend you select a password with at least 8 characters and consider adding a number or a special character to further strengthen your password. In order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful about providing your password to others and change it periodically. If you wish to update a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@truereligionbrandjeans.com">privacy@truereligionbrandjeans.com</a>.</p>
                <p>Please be aware that we may store Personal Data or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or third party service providers.  We take all commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and confidentiality of all Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration and/or destruction.  However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.  In particular, email sent to or from the Site may not always be secure.  Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data via the Internet or by email.</p>
                <p>We do not and will not, at any time, request your Personal Data or other personal information in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication.  Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to us.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is one of our priorities.  For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission at <a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing" target="_blank">http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing</a></p>
                <p><strong>What Choices Do I Have Regarding my Personal Data?</strong></p>
                <p>You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data.  We will honor the choices you make regarding your Personal Data.

Thus, if you order online, we will send you an email confirming your order and may need to contact you by phone, email or regular mail if we have questions about your order.</p>
                <p><u>Social Media Platforms:</u> You may also manage the sharing of certain Personal Data with us when you connect with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook Connect.

The policies and procedures set forth herein do not apply to any Third Party Site.  The owners and operators of all Third Party Sites are responsible for all Personal Data and Non-personal Data provided, collected, maintained, stored or otherwise disclosed on those sites, if any.

                <p><strong>Is Information Collected From Children?</strong></p>
                <p>Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important to us.  This Web Site is a general audience website and is not directed at nor intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect or intend to collect Personal Data from anyone who is under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, you should not provide any Personal Data to us and you should use this Site only with the knowledge, permission and involvement of a parent or guardian.  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through the Site without parental consent.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to us through the Services, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

                <p><strong>What about Online Surveys?</strong></p>
                <p>We may from time to time conduct on-line surveys.  When you complete an online survey, we may ask for certain information including, without limitation, your age, zip code, shopping habits, email and/or mailing address.  This information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><strong>What if I access the Site from Outside of the United States?</strong></p>
                <p>If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, please be aware that you are sending information (including Personal Data) to the United States where our servers are located.  We will hold and process your Personal Data and Non-Personal Data in accordance with privacy laws in the United States and this Privacy Policy.  Please note that privacy laws in the United States may not be the same as, and in some cases may be considered less protective than, privacy laws in other countries.</p>
                <p><strong>How Will I Be Informed About Changes Regarding This Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
                <p>The Site and our business may change from time to time.  As a result (and for other business and/or technological reasons), it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy.  We reserve the right to update, change, amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice.
