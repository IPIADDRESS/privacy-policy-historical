            <p>
                An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you

                at the end of the session.</p>
            <br>
             <h2 class="headline3">
                Use of Cookies and E-Malls:</h2>
            <p>
                We use a third party service provider to send marketing e-mails on behalf of Bioceutica.
                There are no cookies in the e-mail. However. when an e-mail recipient clicks on
                a link to Bioceutica website or micro-sites included in the e-mail. a persistent
                cookie is placed on the user's computer. This cookie is used to measure the effectiveness
                of our e-mail marketing efforts and better understand how our users navigate through
                the site. The cookie set by our service provider will remain on your hard drive
                30 days after the last time you clicked on the coded link in the e-mail, or until
                you delete it.</p>
            <br>
             <h2 class="headline3">
                Use of Cookies for Advertising:</h2>
            <p>
                We use third party service providers to serve and host our advertisements. These
                third parties use persistent cookies to track the number of times our site is accessed
                and whether the site was accessed from the advertisement. The cookies generated
                from the advertisements do not contain personally identiﬁable information and may
                remain on your hard drive three or more years unless deleted by you.<br>
                The third party service providers mentioned above are contractually bound not to
                use any information they gather for any purpose other than providing services to
                us. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer or computer files. In addition.
                we do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to non-Bioceutica
                websites. If you do not wish to receive these cookies, you may set your browser
                to reject the cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how
                to do this), although doing so may affect your ability to perform certain transactions
                on our website.</p>

             <h2 class="headline3">
                Pixel Tags:</h2>
            <p>
                The third party service providers mentioned above serve and host Bioceutica advertisements
                on other sites. To track the effectiveness of Bioceutica advertisements on other
                sites, Bioceutica.com uses pixel tags (also known as clear gifs, beacon gifs, 1-by-1
                gifs, or web bugs). Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the site and consist
                of a few lines of computer coding. If you are visiting Bioceutica.com from an advertisement
                on another site, the pixel tag references the cookie you received when you clicked
                on the advertisement. The pixel tag then registers this activity with the third
                party advertising company to allow us to count the number of times an advertisement
                is accessed. in addition, we also measure the reservations generated from a particular
                ad. At no time is personally identifiable information about you or your reservation
                collected by the third party advertising company. nor is any tracking information
                generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other
                than to report website activity to us or allow us to better target future interactive
                advertising.<br>
                Our third party service providers may use pixel tags in Bioceutica marketing e-mails
                that help us send the e-mail in a format you can read, to allow us to know which
                e-mails you act upon and to better target the content of future e-mails. In addition,
                we track the aggregate number of e-mails read and whether any of the links in the
                e-mail were accessed. No other information is collected or used from pixel tags.</p>
            <br>
             <h2 class="headline3">
                Infonnation We Collect:</h2>
            <p>
                When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we will ask
                you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example. if you would
                like to ask for more information on the business opportunity. we will ask you for
                information such as name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address to process
                your request. We will use your e-mail address to send a confinhation and. if necessary,
                might use the other information to contact you for help to get the information to
                you that you have requested. The same types of information would be requested to
                complete a product purchase. As indicated below (see E-Mail section). we may also
                use your e-mail address to notify you about special offers and promotions.</p>
            <br>
             <h2 class="headline3">
                Securing the Transmission and Storage of information:</h2>
            <p>
                When we ask you for credit card data when making a reservation or purchasing a product.
                it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using
                a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.
                We also use SSL on other select pages where you would enter personally identifiable
                infonnation. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over
                the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted
                from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key
                icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears
                in the locked position. In addition. when accessing a secure server, the first characters
                of the site address will change from http to https. After information reaches Bioceutica
                it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block
                unauthorized access from outside the Company.</p>
            <br>
             <h2 class="headline3">
                E-Mail:</h2>
            <p>
                It is our intention to only send you e-mail communications that will be useful to
                you and that you want to receive. When you make an infonhation request and provide
                your e-mail address, we will occasionally contact you via e-mail and provide information
                about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications
                will relate to Bioceutica offers andlor the promotions of select, reputable third
                parties with whom Bioceutica has a strategic marketing relationship because they
                offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you. We use a
                third party e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider is prohibited
                from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send Bioceutica related
                e-mail. Every time you receive e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out
                of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail. or you may
                opt-out by updating your online profile.</p>
