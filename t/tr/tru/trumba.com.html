<h4><a name="intro">Introduction to Privacy Policy</a></h4>
<p class="notop">The Trumba Service is a web-based software application designed 
to help families, individuals, and colleagues more efficiently plan and run 
their lives. Trumba grew out of our founders’ desire to organize family members 
involved in numerous school, sports, entertainment, and work activities. </p>

<p> Trumba Service is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit through your use of Trumba Service.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or other entities that Trumba Service does not own or control (see <a href="#accept">Your Acceptance of Our Privacy Policy Terms</a>).  If you link to another web site from the Trumba web site, please consult that site's privacy policy. </p>

<p>This privacy policy describes the 
personal information we collect, why we collect it, and explains how it is used. 
By using the Trumba Service, you agree to the collection and use of your 
personal information as described below. You also agree to abide by the terms 
described in the Terms of Use agreement.</p>

deserves and never share, sell, or rent email addresses with any partner,

</li><li>We will not disclose your personal information, without notice, unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or the site; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Trumba or the web site; or (c) act in exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the site or the public.
</li></ul>

<h4><a name="orders">Orders</a></h4>
<p class="notop">If you purchase products or services, we may briefly 
redirect you to an e-commerce transaction partner, who will ask for billing information from you on their 
order form. This information may include name, email, billing address and 
financial information such as credit card number, and expiration date. Once your 
transaction is complete, you will be returned to the Trumba web site. Please read the Privacy Policy and
Terms of Use of all third-party web sites.</p>
<p>Trumba does not collect nor store any financial 
information about you.</p>

<h4><a name="data">Calendar Data</a></h4>
<p class="notop">Any event information you enter in a published “public” calendar 
can potentially be viewed by anyone, unless you choose to restrict access via 
Trumba privacy settings. Trumba provides a number of different privacy levels 
allowing you to share none, some, or all of your calendar information with 
select groups or individuals. Unpublished calendars can also be shared in a manner 
specified by you.</p>
<p>You can also upload an image to published calendars. Your image will be
displayed with your calendar and available to others according to the privacy
settings that you choose.</p>

<h4><a name="email">Trumba Email Products</a></h4>
<p class="notop nobottom">Trumba provides opt-in email 
subscriptions to help enhance the service we provide. These products include: 
</p>
<ul class="notop">
<li><strong>Welcome Email</strong> — 
Based on the email address you supplied when you registered, we will send you 
a one-time welcome email to verify your user name and password. You must 
activate your account through this email. 
</li><li><strong>Unsubscribe</strong> — 
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to opt-out of email 
communications. We provide unsubscribe links within Trumba email products and 
within the web site. Please visit your account preferences page to opt out of 
email subscriptions. 
</li><li><strong>Service-Related 
Announcements</strong> — We may send you service-related email announcements 
on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service 
is suspended for maintenance. Since these emails are not promotional in 
nature, you may not opt-out of these communications. If you do not wish to 
receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 
</li><li><strong>Tell a Friend Email 
</strong>— If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about 
our site, or to forward event information, we will ask you for your friend’s 
name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time 
email inviting him or her to visit the site. Trumba stores this 
information for the sole purposes of sending this one-time email, tracking the 
success of our referral program, storing email preferences, and for providing our members with a list of 
most frequently “mailed to” friends. Your friend may request 
to not receive future email from Trumba by clicking on a link included
in the email sent to them.
</li><li><strong>Market Research Surveys 
</strong>— If you choose to opt in, we may occasionally contact customers who 
purchase products or services from Trumba Corporation for market research 
and/or customer satisfaction surveys or new product announcements offered by 
Trumba Corporation.</li></ul>

<p>We use aggregated anonymous information collected 
through customer surveys and site statistics to improve the products and 
services we offer. We do not connect this data to any personally identifiable 
information we have collected.</p>
<p>We will not share the personally identifiable 
information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties
