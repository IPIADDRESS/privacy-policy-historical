<h1>Trumba Privacy Policy</h1>

<h5 class="altclr">Last Updated: November 10, 2005</h5>

<h4><a name="intro">Introduction to Privacy Policy</a></h4>
<p class="notop">The Trumba OneCalendar Service is a web-based software application designed 
to help families, individuals, and colleagues more efficiently plan and run 
their lives. Trumba Corporation grew out of our founders' desire to organize family members 
involved in numerous school, sports, entertainment, and work activities. </p>

<p> Trumba Corporation is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit through your use of the Trumba Service.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or other entities that Trumba does not own or control (see <a href="#accept">Your Acceptance of Our Privacy Policy Terms</a>).  If you link to another web site from the Trumba web site, please consult that site's privacy policy. </p>

<p>This privacy policy describes the 
personal information we collect, why we collect it, and explains how it is used. 
By using the Trumba Service, you agree to the collection and use of your 
personal information as described below. You also agree to abide by the terms 
described in the <a href="terms.aspx">Trumba Terms of Use</a> agreement.</p>

<h4><a name="guide">General Guidelines</a></h4>
<ul class="notop bullet">
<li>We do not use the information you provide us in any 
manner other than that outlined in this privacy policy. 
</li><li>You can change personal account information or terminate 
your account at any time. 
</li><li>We will store your account information on secure 
servers. 
</li><li>We will provide aggregate or combined user statistics to 
partners without disclosing any personally identifiable information. 
</li><li>We provide tools allowing you to export your calendar 
data at any time for use in other calendar applications. 
</li><li>We will treat your email address with the respect it 
deserves and never share, sell, or rent email addresses with any partner, 
marketing agency, or third parties.
</li><li>We will not disclose your personal information, without notice, unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or the site; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Trumba or the web site; or (c) act in exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the site or the public.
</li></ul>

<h4><a name="collect">Collection of Information</a></h4>
<p class="nospc"> The following table lists the information we collect, why we collect it, and 
how it is used.</p>

<h4><a name="orders">Orders</a></h4>
<p class="notop">If you purchase products or services, we will ask for billing information from you on an 
order form. This information will include name, billing address and 
financial information such as credit card number, and expiration date.</p>
<p>Billing information is encrypted and sent to a credit card transaction processor using a secure connection.  Trumba does not store any billing information in our database.</p>

<h4><a name="data">Calendar Data</a></h4>
<p class="notop">Any event information you enter in a published "public" calendar 
can potentially be viewed by anyone, unless you choose to restrict access via 
Trumba privacy settings. Trumba provides a number of different privacy levels 
allowing you to share none, some, or all of your calendar information with 
select groups or individuals. Unpublished calendars can also be shared in a manner 
specified by you.</p>
<p>You can also upload an image to published calendars. Your image will be
displayed with your calendar and available to others according to the privacy
settings that you choose.</p>

<h4><a name="email">Trumba Email Products</a></h4>
<p class="notop nobottom">Trumba provides opt-in email 
subscriptions to help enhance the service we provide. These products include: 
</p>
<ul class="notop">
<li><strong>Verification Email</strong> — 
Based on the email address you supplied when you registered, we will send you 
a one-time verification email to verify your email address and password. You must activate your account through this email.
<p></p> 
</li><li><strong>Unsubscribe</strong> — 
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to opt-out of email 
communications. We provide unsubscribe links within Trumba email products and 
within the web site. Registered users can opt out of email subscriptions using the "Email options" link on the bottom of the "Account Settings" page. 
<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Service-Related 
Announcements</strong> — We may send you service-related email announcements 
on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service 
is suspended for maintenance. Since these emails are not promotional in 
nature, you may not opt-out of these communications. If you do not wish to 
receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 
<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Invite a Friend to Trumba Email 
</strong>— If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, or to forward event information, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time 
email inviting him or her to visit the site. Trumba stores this 
information for the sole purposes of sending this one-time email, tracking the 
success of our referral program, storing email preferences, and for providing our members with a list of 
most frequently "mailed to" friends. Your friend may request 
to not receive future email from the Trumba Service by clicking on a link included in the email sent to them.
</li></ul>

You can remove persistent cookies 
by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "Help" file. However if you configure your browser or choose to reject cookies, you may only use a portion of our web site including "Add to My Calendar" and viewing a public calendar.

browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and 
requested URLs.</p>

log files:</p>
<ul class="notop bullet">

</li><li>To administer our web site 
</li><li>To gather aggregate demographic information 
</li><li>To understand which pages are most popular on our 
site</li></ul>

<h4><a name="third">Third-Party Advertisers</a></h4>

not owned or controlled by Trumba Corporation. Please be aware that Trumba

encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy 
policy of every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
</p>

<p class="notop">Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as 
part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of 
service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, 
bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal information would be transferred 
as one of the business assets of the company. 
</p>

<p class="notop">From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to 
participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you decide to participate, we 
will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation 
in these surveys or contests is voluntary and you may choose whether or not to 
disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact 
information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information 
(such as ZIP code).</p>

through customer surveys and site statistics to improve the products and 
services we offer. We do not connect this data to any personally identifiable 
information we have collected.</p>

information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties

in to sharing such information.</p>

<h4><a name="child">Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</a></h4>
