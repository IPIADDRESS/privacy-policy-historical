<p dir="ltr"><span>Effective date: March 20, 2015</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Trustify, Inc. (the “Company”, “Trustify” “we”, or “us”) maintains strong privacy protections and takes your privacy seriously. Our Privacy Policy helps you understand how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service. This Privacy Policy covers both our web and mobile application services.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Service” refers to the Company’s service, which enables you to connect with and hire a Private Investigator (“PI”). Information about our service can be obtained at </span><a href="http://www.flimflam.com/"><span>www.Trustify.</span></a><span>info. We reserve the right to offer you new products, offerings, tools, and services in the future. We will never sell, exchange, trade or share your personally identifiable information with another individual or company (“third party”) without your prior written and explicit informed consent .</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By using our service or by otherwise providing information to us, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please discontinue using the service and do not give us any of your information. Please also review our Terms and Conditions, which apply to our website and mobile application.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We collect information you provide to us through the website or the mobile application. We collect some Non-Personal Information and Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Information”) each time you access the website or mobile application. Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, your internet service provider, the browser you use, general demographic information, referring/exit pages and URLs, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks you make as you navigate the website or mobile application. Personal Information includes any information that can be used to identify you such as your name, address, and email address.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Personal Information</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Information We May Collect Using Tracking Technology On Our Website and Mobile Application</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser when you use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We may also track this information using other technologies such as cookies, beacons, or small text files, which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal Information about that user, recognize that user when they return to the website, and maintain a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services. We store this information both regarding individuals and collectively for aggregate analysis. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We may use cookies and other tracking methods such as beacons, tags, and scripts in order to track the user’s browsing throughout the website, analyze usage, and trends, and collect demographic information about the users of the website. The website may also record the IP address from which you access the site.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Personal Information Provided on the Website or Mobile Application:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We use the Personal Information you provide to us in order to create your user profile and to match you with a PI. The information you provide on the location and person you want investigated will be shared with the PI with whom you book the job through the mobile application. &nbsp;The PI that you select for your job will not receive your personal information and you will be able to communicate with the PI you select anonymously. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, exchange, trade or share for marketing purposes or any other purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your prior written and explicit informed consent. We will only share certain Personal Information with the following third party vendors who are performing services for the Company: We use Stripe for processing credit card payments, with whom we share your name and credit card number to process transactions. Additionally, we use Mailchimp to generate email newsletters which will be emailed occasionally to our users. We host our database on Amazon Web Services. Those vendors only use your Personal Information at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy and are not allowed to share this information with any other third party.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Non-Personal Information</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We may use Non-Personal Information to improve the Service or customize the user experience. We may also aggregate Non-Personal Information from all or some customers in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site and of our service. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We seek to protect your information from potential security breaches by employing security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers), both during transmission of the information and while we store it. We store all our information using secure databases provided by Amazon Web Services (the “Amazon cloud”). However, no measures taken can guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Information and we cannot guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of the Service and our system’s security measures.

Otherwise, we will retain your Personal Information per the terms of the Privacy Policy and as necessary to comply with any existing legal obligation or agreement.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>COPPA Disclosure. &nbsp;Pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), this Service is not directed at individuals younger than 18 years of age.
