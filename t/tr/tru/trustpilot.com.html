including, but not limited to www.trustpilot.com, (the "Website")

Policy, which govern the processing of personal data on the
Website.</p>

<p>We, Trustpilot, Inc., 116 West 23rd Street, 5th floor, New York,
NY 10011, USA ("Trustpilot") recommend that you
<strong>print</strong> and <strong>keep</strong> a copy of this
Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>1 Collecting information on the Website</h3>

<p>1.1 Master data</p>

<p>When you create a profile on the Website, we collect the
following master data: Your username, your password and your email
address. The purpose of the collection of this information is to
identify you as user when you log on to the Website. Furthermore,
you can choose to add more information to your profile, such as
your photo and demographic information.</p>

<p>1.2 Reviews</p>

<p>When you make a review of a company, we collect the information
you state in the review, including which company you review, which
purchase(s) the review concerns, and how you evaluate the
company.</p>

<p>1.3 Cookies</p>

<p>The Website uses cookies. Cookies are digital information which
is stored on your computer. The cookie does not identify the
individual user but the user's computer, and it is used for
measuring Website traffic i.e. number of visits on the Website,
which domains the visitors comes from, which pages the visitors
visit on the Website and in which overall geographical area the
visitors are located. The purpose of using cookies is thus to
produce anonymous statistics in order to improve the functionality
of the Website. You can read more about what cookies the Website
uses and for what purposes below.</p>

<p>1.4 IP adresses</p>

<p>When visiting the Website, the IP address of the user's computer
is registered. The IP address is the numerical address of the
computer used when visiting the Website. The IP address is
registered to enable Trustpilot to trace the used computer in case
of misuse or unlawful actions in connection with the visit on or
use of the Website. Further, the IP address is used to derive your
approximate location (city level).</p>

<p>1.5 Newsletter</p>

<p>If you sign up for Trustpilot's newsletters, Trustpilot register
the information supplied by you (e.g. your name, email address
etc.). If you no longer wish to receive newsletters from
Trustpilot, you can unsubscribe by logging on to your profile and
edit your information.</p>

<p>1.6 Information from other services, including Social
Network(s)</p>

<p>As part of our services, we provide you with the possibility of
connecting your profile on the Website with your profile on social
networks such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter ("Social
Network(s)"). Some information about you will automatically be
collected from Social Networks when connecting your Trustpilot
profile with your profile on Social Networks.</p>

<p>The information collected from Social Networks depends on what
information you have made available on the network and your privacy
settings for sharing such information on the network. Depending on
the settings, we may e.g. collect the following information about
you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name and/or username</li>

<li>E-mail address</li>

<li>Gender</li>

<li>Date of birth</li>

<li>Profile photo</li>

<li>Location</li>
</ul>

<p>When you request to have your Trustpilot profile connected to a
profile on a Social Network, you will be informed on which
information we will collect from the network in question before
your request is executed.</p>

<p>The purpose of collecting information from Social Networks is to
connect members of your network, which are both users of Trustpilot
and of one or more of the Social Networks, and thereby both
increase the confidence in the reviews made by the members of the
network as well as create a better user experience on the
Website.</p>

<p>Trustpilot does not collect other personal identifiable
information from visitors of the Website, unless the visitor
provides the information to us.</p>

the recorded data, including the personal information, under its
