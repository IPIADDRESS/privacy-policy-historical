<b><span style="">Contacting You.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="">
When you provide us with information in connection with
a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your
contact information, including an email address or telephone number in
connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action
constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us.
You expressly consent to our communicating with you about TruePeopleSearch
using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the
legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us
with the authorization to contact you. This means you may be contacted in
person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone
number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any
other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications
device may be capable of receiving.&nbsp;

<b><span style="">Transactional Communications.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="">
We may send you notices from time to time relating to
your account or your orders. These may include order confirmations, invoices or
customer service notifications. We may also send you service-related
announcements when it is necessary to do so; for instance, if our Service is
temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a product is delayed
or there is some service issue with something you may have ordered. You may not
opt-out of receiving these communications, which are not promotional in
nature.&nbsp;

guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us,
because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different
e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. Unsubscribing from one
marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing
lists. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mails,

that are related to your account(s), orders or other services you have
requested, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving
them.&nbsp;

Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you elect to register for
the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either
will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or
we might be providing your Personal Information directly to the third party in
order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with
you. Your Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well
as the privacy policy and practices of such third party. We are not responsible

information and/or communications in situations that we believe to be: (i)
emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or
property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat;
