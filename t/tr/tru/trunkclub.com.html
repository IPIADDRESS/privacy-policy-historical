<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<section class="lead">
Welcome to the Web site (the “Site”) of Trunk Club, Inc. (collectively
with its affiliates, “Trunk Club”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”).  This Site
is operated by Trunk Club and has been created to provide information
about our company and its services (together with the Site, the
“Service(s)”) to our Service visitors (“you”, “your”). This notice
describes our policy with respect personally identifiable and other
information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.
By visiting the Site or interacting with the Services, you are
accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
</section>
<h3>What information does Trunk Club collect?</h3>
<p>
When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect
personally identifiable information and other information from you,
as further described below:
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<h4>Information You Give Us:</h4>
<p>
We receive and store any personally identifiable and other
information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way
(including by making it publicly accessible).
</p>
<h4>Automatically Collected Information:</h4>
<p>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
interact with us, which is collected passively using various
technologies. For example, like many Web sites, we use “cookies,” and
we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses
trunkclub.com.  Such information cannot presently be used identify
you personally.  If associated with other information such you can be
identified personally, such information would be treated as
personally identifiable information hereunder.
</p>
<p>
We may disclose this non-personally identifiable information in order
to describe the Services to current and prospective business partners
and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
<h4>Email Communications:</h4>
<p>
We may receive confirmation when you open email from Trunk Club if
your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to
receive email or other mail from us, please contact us at
service@trunkclub.com and we will promptly remove you from our
mailing lists.
</p>
</div>
<h3>How does Trunk Club use personally identifiable and other information?</h3>
<p>
Trunk Club uses the personally identifiable information you provide
in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you
provide personally identifiable information for a certain reason, we
may use it in connection with the reason for which it was provided.
For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the personally
identifiable information you provide to answer your question or
resolve your problem. Also, if you provide personally identifiable
information in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use
your personally identifiable information to provide you with access
to such Services and to monitor your use of such Services. We may
also use your personally identifiable information and other
information collected through the Services to help us improve the
content and functionality of the Services, to customize your shopping
experience, to better understand our customers and to improve the
Services. Trunk Club and its affiliates may use this information to
contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will
be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you
will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving
future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to
receive any future communications or you wish to have your name
deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated above.
</p>
<p>
If Trunk Club intends on using any personally identifiable
information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy
Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at
the time at which the personally identifiable information is
collected.
</p>
<h3>Does Trunk Club share personally identifiable information?</h3>
<p>
We do not share personally identifiable information about our
customers, except in the specific cases described here:
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<h4>Third-Party Service Providers:</h4>
<p>
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
sending postal mail and email, developing systems, analyzing data,
providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and
providing customer service. When we employ other companies or
individuals to perform a function of this nature, we only provide
them with the information that they need to perform their specific
function.
</p>
<h4>Business Transfers:</h4>
<p>
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores,
subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, personally
identifiable customer information generally is one of the transferred
business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless the customer consents otherwise).
In the event that Trunk Club or substantially all of its assets are
acquired, personally identifiable customer information will be one of
the transferred assets.
</p>
<h4>Protection of Trunk Club and Others:</h4>
<p>
We release account and other personally identifiable information when
we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, or protect
the rights, property, or safety of Trunk Club employees, our users,
or others. This includes exchanging personally identifiable
information with other companies and organizations for fraud
protection and credit risk reduction. This does not include selling,
renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable
information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of
the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<h4>With Your Consent:</h4>
<p>
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information
about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity
to choose not to share the personally identifiable information.
</p>
</div>
<h3>How secure is information about me?</h3>
<p>
We work to protect the security of your information during order
transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
encrypts order information you transmit. We reveal only the last five
digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of
course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate
credit card company during order processing. It is important for you
to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
</p>
<h3>What about links to other Web sites?</h3>
<p>
Our Site might include links to third-party Web sites. The policies
and procedures we described here do not apply to the third-party
sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Trunk Club
endorses or has reviewed the third-party sites. We suggest contacting
those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
</p>
<h3>Which information can I access?</h3>
<p>
Trunkclub.com gives you access to information about your account and
your interactions with Trunkclub.com for the limited purpose of
viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
</p>
<h3>What choices do I have?</h3>
<p>
You can always choose not to provide information, even though it
might be needed to make a purchase. If you do not want to receive
e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us at
service@trunkclub.com or call us at (312) 266-8700 between 9 and 6 PM
Central time to be promptly removed from our lists.
</p>
<h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
<p>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems
to recognize your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most
browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new
cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new
cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can
disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash
cookies, by changing add-on settings or visiting the Web site of its
manufacturer.
</p>
<h3>Are children allowed to use Trunk Club and Trunkclub.com?</h3>
<p>
Trunk Club does not sell products for purchase by children. If you
are under 18, you may use Trunk Club and Trunkclub.com only with the
involvement of a parent or guardian.
</p>
<h3>Integrating Social Networking Services</h3>
<p>
One of the special features of the Service is that it may allow you
to enable or log in to the Service via various social networking
services like Facebook (“Social Networking Service(s)”). By directly
integrating these Social Networking Services, we make your online
experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this
feature, we would ask you to log into the relevant Social Networking
Service. If you add a Social Networking Services account to the
Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services
account, we would collect relevant information necessary to enable
the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data
contained within that Social Networking Service.  As part of such
integration, the Social Networking Service would provide us with
access to certain information that you have provided to the Social
Networking Service, and we would use, store and disclose such
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  However, please
remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use,
store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of
such third parties, and Company shall have no liability or
responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any
Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the Service.
</p>
<p>
You may also have the option of posting your Trunk Club activities to
Social Networking Services; you acknowledge that if you choose to use
this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social
Networking Services you have enabled will be able to view such
activity.
</p>
<h3>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>
<p>
If you choose to visit Trunk Club, your visit and any dispute over
privacy is subject to this Notice including limitations on damages,
disputes, and choice of law. If you have any concern about privacy at
Trunk Club, please email service@trunkclub.com and we will work to
address it.
</p>
<p>
Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change
also. You should check our Site frequently to see recent changes.
Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all
information that we have about you and your account. We will never
materially change our policies and practices to make them less
protective of customer information collected in the past without the
consent of affected customers.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for reading this far.
