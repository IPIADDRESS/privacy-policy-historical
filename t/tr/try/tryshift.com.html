                    <br>

                    Thank you for visiting www.tryshift.com (the “Site”). The Site is an Internet property of Redbrick Technologies Inc. and its affiliated companies (“Redbrick”, “our”, “we” or “us”). Redbrick is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe to you and to outline our practices and policies associated with any information (such as the Application Data, Anonymous Data, and Personal Data, each as defined below) that we may collect from you, or that you may share with us when you access or use the Site, the Shift application (the “Software”), or any related products and/or services.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    By accessing the Site or using the Software, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy in its entirety.
                </p>

                <h3>Use of Personal and Anonymous Data</h3>
                <p>
                    When you access the Site, purchase, download trial or evaluation versions, register for any associated products and/or services, or use the Software, we may collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you. We may also collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data when you send us information or communications. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example and without limitation, your name, phone number, physical address, credit card information, and email address for the purposes of recording the transaction when you access the Site or when you use any of the Software or any associated products and/or services. “Anonymous Data” refers to data about you that is not associated with, or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. When you link third-party Accounts like Google or Outlook to the Software, nothing is collected from these accounts. As such, Personal Data and Anonymous Data expressly exclude any information that could be collected by way of linking your accounts. This data is only stored locally on your computer system and thus does not constitute any part of data that we collect. Only information that you provide to us directly (like your name, email address, credit card, address, etc.) is considered Personal Data. In most cases, Personal Data collection is only required to provide the Software and related services. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    To make our website and Software more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect Anonymous Data or Application Data from you such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol IP address, domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and referring URLs to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit. We may also use Anonymous Data for market research purposes and to improve our products and the Software. We may share Anonymous Data with selected third parties and business partners, however, we will not share any Anonymous Data if such information is, or will be, linked to your Personal Data, unless we have given you notice, as described in this Privacy Policy, and you have given us authorization to do so. Redbrick will use IP addresses to identify users of the Site and Software if and when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s policies, or to protect our products, the Software, the Site, or other users of the Site and/or Software. We may use Personal Data collected from you for the following general purposes: (1) to fulfill your requests for our Software; (2) to improve the Site and Software; (3) to contact you to resolve problems; (4) to send you information about the Software including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages; (5) to communicate with you about products and services offered by us and our selected partners; (6) to engage with third-party service providers so that you can access and use the Software; and (7) to periodically conduct product and market research regarding your use of the Software. If and when we use a third-party payment processing merchant, third-party technical support provider, or third-party hosting provider, we ensure that the same privacy criteria, as defined herein, are in place with such third parties. We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen.
                
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We will periodically send you newsletters and emails that directly promote the use of the Site or the purchase of our Software. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive, or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings from us, you may continue to receive future mailings from third parties that you have requested to receive information from. If you do not wish to receive future communications from third-party providers, you should notify them directly of your choice regarding their use of your information. To opt-out of having future third-party marketing communications sent to you, you will be required to unsubscribe with the applicable third-party providers.  Despite your request to no longer receive future newsletters or promotional and marketing communications from us, we reserve the right to continue to send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Software or Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                <h3>Sharing of Personal Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We will never sell, trade, or rent any Personal Data to any third-party that we collect from you when you access the Site or use the Software.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    In certain special cases, we may disclose Personal Data when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or is otherwise injuring or interfering with our rights, property or operations, other users of the Software, or anyone who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your Personal Data and any Application Data when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have engaged in conduct that might be considered unlawful, fraudulent, or might harm or damage the reputation or standing of Redbrick with either the general public or with a business partner or potential business partner of Redbrick, we reserve the right to release your Personal Data to such persons or third parties, as we consider necessary, to prevent you from causing injury to, or otherwise injuring or interfering, now or in the future, with our rights, property or operations or otherwise the rights, property or operations of anyone which could be harmed by such conduct.
                </p>

                <h3>Third-party Relationships</h3>
                <p>
                    Third-party Links. The Site and the Software may contain links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites and, where you request information from third-party providers, we may transfer you directly to the websites of such third-party providers. Redbrick is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites. In some cases, you may be required to provide certain information to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and Redbrick has no responsibility or liability relating to them. We do not endorse, nor are we responsible for the accuracy of, the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of such third-party website. These third-party entities are independent third parties and are not affiliated with Redbrick.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Third-party Offers. Redbrick may provide you with the opportunity to receive special offers, products and/or services from third parties. Where you indicate the desire to receive certain offers, products or services from a third-party during the applicable information collection process, your Personal Data that was provided during that information collection process will be shared with the applicable third-party so that such third-party may provide their products and/or services to you so that you do not have to complete another information collection form to purchase or receive that product or service. Clicking on any third-party offers may add and place cookies on your computer prior to directing you to the applicable advertiser’s site. Cookies are used only for tracking and reporting purposes. No personally identifiable information is collected or stored by Redbrick during this process.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Third-party Technology and Software. The Site or the Software may contain certain software technologies and services licensed from third-party providers. These third-party providers have separate privacy and data collection practices and policies, and Redbrick has no responsibility or liability relating to them. We do not endorse, nor are we responsible for the accuracy of the terms and conditions of any third-party privacy policies. These third-party entities are independent third parties and are not affiliated with Redbrick.
                </p>

                <h3>How We Collect and Use Application Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The Software may collect certain information from you including, but not limited to: User IP addresses, OS version, OS localization, version of the application, localization of the application, device, bug reports, etc. The Software obtains this information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our software “agent” embedded in the Software or on the website that you are accessing. The Software generates a globally unique identifier (“GUID”) that is stored on your computer to uniquely identify it. The GUID is a randomly generated number; it does not contain any Personal Data. The GUID is stored on your computer and sent with every report generated by the Software. The Software does not, and will not, collect any Personal Data from your computer(s) without your prior approval. Application Data we collect is primarily used to report application usage, improve the Software, and track the performance of various marketing initiatives. Application Data may also be used by Redbrick to answer questions that customers have about their account.
                </p>

                <h3>Google Account Authentication</h3>
                <p>
                    Accounts are added to the Software using OAuth authentication. OAuth is a secure mechanism which gives the Software access to your Google or Outlook account data without letting us know your password. This token is valid during your use of the Software. If you remove an account, or uninstall the Software, you’ll be prompted to re-authorize the Software for each Google or Outlook Account using OAuth.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    We only use the authorization to support certain Software features like unread email count for each account, and to support push desktop notifications if requested. This information is local, and not stored on, or transmitted to, our servers. 
                </p>

                <h3>Security of Data</h3>
                <p>
                    Redbrick is committed to protecting the security of any Application Data and Personal Data that is collected by Redbrick. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect any Application Data and Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Despite these measures, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Redbrick cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the collection and storage of any Application Data and Personal Data, including without limitation, any mistakes and security breaches that may happen. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect the Application Data and Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                </p>
