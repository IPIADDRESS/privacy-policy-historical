Once you give us your Personal Data, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with Personal Data, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.</p><p>We may collect and store the following Personal Data:</p><ul class="List"><li>e-mail address, phone number, physical contact information, and sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;</li><li>transactional information based on your activities on the Website (such as buying, selling, item and content you generate or that relates to your account);</li><li>shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase an item;</li><li>community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our Website, and correspondence sent to us;</li><li>other information from your interaction with our Website, Service, and content, including device ID, computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, IP address and standard web log information;</li><li>additional information we ask you to submit to authenticate yourself or if we believe you are violating site policies (for example, we may ask you to send us an ID or bill to verify your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your identity or ownership of an item you list);</li><li>information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data;</li><li>if you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply; and</li><li>other supplemental information from third parties.</li></ul><p>Information Collected via Technology:</p><ul class="List"><li>To make our Website and Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</li><li>We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the Website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</li></ul><p>Information Collected from Third Party Companies:</p><ul class="List"><li>We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies that provide our Service by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies or individuals that offer their products on our Website or through our Service. These third party companies and individuals may supply us with Personal Data,. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Website in order to improve the Service we provide.</li></ul><p>Registration and Sharing Through Third-Party Services:</p><ul class="List"><li>We may offer single sign-on services that allow you to use third party login credentials to sign into Service.

If you wish to discontinue such sharing, you will be able to do so through your preference page.</li></ul><p>Information You Share on Celery:</p><ul class="List"><li>Some (mostly optional) information you provide, such as your full name, may be displayed throughout the Website (and so available to the public) and connected to all of your Celery activity. Notices sent to other Users about suspicious activity and policy violations on our Site refer to specific items. So if you associate your name with your items, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your Celery items.</li><li>If you access our Site from a shared computer or a computer in an Internet café, certain information about you may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</li></ul></div><div class="Content Content--textLeft"><header class="Content-header"><h1 class="Content-heading">C.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other Users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. When Users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's e-mail address and other contact and shipping information. In all cases, you must give other Member a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p><p>You agree to use Member information only for:</p><ul class="List"><li>Celery transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages;</li><li>using services offered through Celery (such as shipping and fraud complaints), or</li><li>other purposes that a User expressly chooses.</li></ul></div><div class="Content Content--textLeft"><header class="Content-header"><h1 class="Content-heading">F.

If you do share your password or your Personal Data with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Data and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Celery and change your password.</p></div><div class="Content Content--textLeft"><header class="Content-header"><h1 class="Content-heading">H.
