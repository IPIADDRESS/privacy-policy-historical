				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

PRIVACY POLICY
CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE TRYBOOKING SITE. BY USING THIS SITE YOU
ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU
CHOOSE NOT TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY THEN YOUR
ACCOUNT MAY BE CANCELLED. TRYBOOKING IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY
REFUND TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF YOUR ACCOUNT BEING TERMINATED.</p>
<p>Reporting
Violations Of The Privacy
Policy</p>
<p>Any user of this
Site may report any
alleged violation of the Site's Privacy Policy to&nbsp;TryBooking by
using the following email link info@trybooking.com wherein we will
investigate your claim and take any actions we deem appropriate in
our sole discretion.</p>
<p>Updates.</p>
<p>TryBooking may
alter its Privacy
policy at any time. Any variations become effective on posting. By
continuing to use the Site after the Privacy policy has been updated
you agree to be bound by these updates.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="intro">Our commitment to
Privacy</p>
<p>TryBooking is
respectful of the
privacy of all users of the TryBooking Site including account
holders. We are committed to safeguarding account holder details
including any transactions which may occur between account holders
and their customers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">1. What Personal
Information does
the Site collect?</p>
<p>If you choose to
register as an
Event Organiser on the TryBooking Site you will be required to create
an account in order to use the Site to create and manage Events.
Establishment of this account will require that you provide certain
personal details in order for&nbsp;TryBooking to ensure you are correctly
registered. The mandatory personal details that must be submitted to create a TryBooking account are:</p>
<p>First Name, Last
Name, Address, Work
Phone number or other contact number, Account Password and a valid
Email Address.</p>
<p>Transaction details
will also be
kept of any customer bookings made for an Event on this Site for
audit purposes. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2. When Does the
Site Collect Your
Personal Information?</p>
<p>In general,
personal information
about you may be collected when:</p>
<p>Registering as a
user of the
TryBooking Site. </p>
<p>Making a Booking
for an Event
created on the TryBooking Site. </p>
<p>Signing-up or
subscribing for
products or services that we may periodically make available. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">3. What Does the
Site Use Your
Personal Information For?</p>
<p>TryBooking may use personal information in the following ways:
</p>
<p>When the Event&nbsp;Organiser first creates
an account, the
TryBooking system will automatically send an activation link to the
account holder's Email Address as part of activating that account. </p>
<p>If an account
holder has subscribed
to any products or services that may be available such as a
newsletter, then the appropriate information will be sent to their
Email Address. </p>
<p>On the rare
occasions we may need to
personally contact an account holder other than via email. In this
instance, we may need to use their contact phone number or other
details acquired during creation of their account. </p>
<p>Whenever a booking
is made for an
Event, the attendee will be sent an appropriate notification to
their Email Address. </p>
<p>If an account
holder chooses to have
a standby list for an Event, then any customer who has requested to
be placed on that standby list may have TryBooking automatically
notify them if a booking(s) becomes available by use of their Email
Address. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">4. How long does
the Site Retain Your
Personal Information?</p>
<p>If you are a
TryBooking account
holder we may retain your information as long as you maintain your
registered status. Any transactions that may occur between account
holders and their customers when booking an Event via the TryBooking
site will be retained for a period of 7 years. After this period has
expired, these transactions will be purged from the TryBooking system.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">5. What
non-personal information may
be collected by this site?</p>
<p>Whenever anyone
uses the TryBooking
Site, information will be collected on how certain features of the
Site are used, what general area Users are contacting us from, how
many people visit the Site at any given time etc. This information
does not contain any personal information of Users visiting or using
the site. This information will only ever be used to aid us in any
technical issues that may arise or for statistical analysis to help
us identify and improve use of the Site to the benefit of all Users. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">6. Data Security</p>
<p>TryBooking does not
store Credit
Card numbers, only the last four digits of the Credit Card are kept
for display purpose for the booking. </p>
<p>Any personal
information that may be
used by the TryBooking Site in order to carry out its necessary
functions is stored on a physically separate computer that is
protected by a Firewall. The data itself is also encrypted to further
reduce any risk that your information will be obtained and used by
unauthorised access.</p>
<p>The TryBooking
application may need
to read personal information in order to carry out its necessary
functions such as sending email notifications to account holders
etc. The application has only a very limited deletion capability, so
that in the unlikely event unauthorised access does occur, damage to
any existing records will be kept to an absolute minimum. </p>
<p>However, given the
increasing
sophistication of computer hackers, we cannot make any absolute
guarantee that our systems will never be accessed without our consent
or that our systems are impenetrable, only that we will take all
reasonable measures to ensure the security of your and our personal
information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. External Links</span> </p>
<p>The TryBooking site
may contain
links to other Internet websites independent of us and vice versa.
TryBooking cannot be reasonably expected to be aware of nor held
responsible for the privacy policies or practices of these other
websites.</p>
