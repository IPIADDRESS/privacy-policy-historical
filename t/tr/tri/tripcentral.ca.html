						The Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was enacted on January 1, 2001 to

						<p>At Tripcentral.ca, we value your trust and believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of the individual. A 
						travel enquiry and purchase requires the voluntary disclosure of personal information and an exchange of that information 
						with various third party suppliers. We have appointed a Privacy Officer to handle requests for information; ensure our 
						Privacy Protection Policy complies with the legislation; oversee the integrity of our systems and monitor end supplier 
						adherence to PIPEDA.
						</p><p>The following Privacy Protection Policy was updated and posted on Tripcentral.ca on January 11, 2004. Questions

						Tripcentral.ca collects personal information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visiting and calling our physical locations or by visiting our website. In order to plan and purchase a travel product or service some basic personal information is required. This may include:
						<ul>
							<li>Name, Title, Gender
							</li><li>Address
							</li><li>Phone number
							</li><li>Email address
							</li><li>Emergency contact information 
							</li><li>Credit card number and expiration date
							</li><li>Citizenship, Immigration status, Passport details
							</li><li>Birth date
							</li><li>Frequent flyer information, meal &amp; seats preferences
						</li></ul>
						<p><b>Individual Profiles</b><br>
							Tripcentral.ca collects your name and contact information (telephone number and email address) when a travel enquiry is 
							opened. In order to process the request and complete a reservation additional information is collected about each traveller 
							along with his or her preferences. 
							</p><p>Full legal name, gender and title are required by the airlines in order to comply with Federal travel regulations. </p>
							<p>An address is required to bind the contract and send proof of purchase. Phone and email contacts are required for 
								communication during the purchase process and following the sale in cases of schedule changes, disrupted travel, emergency, 
								and follow-up after travel is completed.</p>
							<p>Credit card details are required internally or by end suppliers for settlement of purchases. Citizenship and Immigration 
								status is required by the Travel Industry Act (TICO) to ensure travellers are advised of correct travel documentation. 
								Place of birth, nationality, age, passport details are also required by airlines to comply with Canadian Transportation 
								Act (CTA) regulations and governments for visas and travel documents.</p>
							<p>Birth dates are required in order to purchase insurance, to receive special rates (e.g. senior, youth, child fares) and 
								facilitate unaccompanied minor (UM) service.</p>
							<p>Additional personal ID numbers and preferences such as frequent flyer numbers, past passenger numbers, car ID numbers, 
								hotel ID numbers and seat requests are needed to accrue personal rewards and to access special rates and services. Special 
								meal and religious requirements are collected to ensure travellers receive suitable meal service.</p>
							<p><b>Contests</b><br>
								Tripcentral.ca periodically provides opportunities to participate in contests. Information collected from participants is 
								required to determine a winner and all personal information about identifiable individuals is discarded after the prize has 
								been awarded. </p>
							<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
								Upon visiting the Tripcentral.ca website, your computer is automatically assigned a "cookie" (a small unique text 
								identifier). Cookies are placed on your computer hard drive to support your visit and do not include any personal 
								information. Cookies are stored on the local hard drive and remain there until manually deleted.</p>
							<p><b>IP Addresses</b><br>
								Tripcentral.ca collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the purposes of administration, to gather broad demographic 
								information and to audit the misuse of our web site.</p>
							<p><b>Computer Information</b><br>
								Tripcentral.ca collects certain technical information from your computer such as the operating system, web browser type 
								and version, screen resolution, IP address and referrer site.</p>
							<p><b>Permission</b><br>
								By making a travel enquiry you give Tripcentral.ca permission to collect voluntarily provided personal information, and by 
								using the Tripcentral.ca website you agree to allow a cookie to be set on your computer and the collection of personal and 
								computer information.</p></td></tr>
						<tr><td colspan="2" class="tblheadingboldbg" valign="top">Use of Personal Information</td></tr>
						<tr><td valign="top" class="tbltext0">
							Tripcentral.ca uses the personal information in order to process and compete travel inquires and reservations. The records 
							are maintained for seven (7) years from date of booking (six years full calendar years plus the year of the transaction) 
							as required by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA). Tripcentral.ca does not sell or distribute any personal 
							information to third parties for marketing purposes.
						<p><b>Third Party Suppliers</b><br>
							In order to complete travel bookings certain personal information is passed on to third party Canadian and non-Canadian 
							suppliers such as airlines, cruise lines and hotels. The information varies according to the type of travel booked. For 
							example, a name and car ID number is required in order to complete a car reservation. A name, date of birth and place of 
							residence is required for an insurance policy. A name, phone number, credit card number, expiry date and room preference 
							is required to complete a sun vacation booking.</p>
						<p>It is important to note that because Tripcentral.ca acts as the agent during the process of requesting and booking 
							travel you are also a client and the third party supplier. As such your personal information is therefore covered by that 
							third party suppler's privacy policy over which Tripcentral.ca has no control.</p>
						<p>Tripcentral.ca sends the minimum required personal information to the third party suppliers and does not sell any data 
							(individually or in bulk).</p>
						<p><b>Legal Obligations</b><br>
							Tripcentral.ca may be required by law to disclose certain personal information in cases of illegal activities or in order 
							to resolve disputes that arise in the normal course of business.</p>
						<p><b>Junk Mail</b><br>
							Tripcentral.ca does not send promotional marketing materials or newsletters. Every travel purchase must be confirmed in 
							writing (as per TICO) and as such an invoice will be mailed to your designated mailing address. Advise the agent at time 
							of booking if you wish to pick this invoice up in person and therefore avoid receiving the mailed copy.</p>
						<p><b>Spam</b><br>
							Tripcentral.ca does not send unsolicited email, surveys, contests, seat sale notices, special promotions, sweepstakes, 
							sell-offs or newsletters by email or any other means. We will however contact you, by email and telephone, with respect to 
							your travel enquiry or future enquiries that are active. Simply advising the agent or replying to the email will stop 
							communication by closing the enquiry.</p>
						<p><b>Spyware</b><br>
							Tripcentral.ca does not condone the use of spyware (i.e. pop-up window advertising) and does not employ any similar 
							technologies. Tripcentral.ca does not sell space on the website to third parties or allow third parties access to user 
							information.</p>
						<p><b>IP Addresses</b><br>
							Tripcentral.ca uses aggrigate IP address information and does not ordinarily link IP addresses to personally identifiable 
							information. However when necessary to enforce compliance with the Terms of Sale and Terms of Use, to protect our web site 
							or other users and to prosecute misuse, we will link individual IP addresses.</p>
						<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
							Portfolio management, management of individual enquiries within the portfolio and individual session management all 
							require cookies. They are used to track advertising referrer sources and to test the effectiveness of online marketing 
							campaigns. Aggregate statistics are used in the web site planning and development cycle and to monitor overall traffic. 
							Cookies identify excessive users who can be tracked using IP addresses.</p>
						<p><b>Computer Information</b><br>
							Tripcentral.ca uses operating system, browser and screen resolution information in aggregate during the development cycle.</p></td></tr>
