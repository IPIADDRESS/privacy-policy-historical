<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TRIFOXMEDIA, LLC, and each of its
related web sites (“TriFoxMedia”) Privacy Policy</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Last updated May 22, 2009.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This Privacy Policy outlines important
information regarding the use and disclosure of information collected
via this Website.  TriFoxMedia provides this Privacy Policy to help
users make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue
using the Website.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE
CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY
TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. TRIFOXMEDIA DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF
CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB
SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO TriFoxMedia OR USE ANY OF
THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES
REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This Privacy Policy applies to
TriFoxMedia’s collection, use, storage and disclosure of
information by TriFoxMedia on its (a) websites, including all its
divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the
“Website”), (b) on various third party websites, and (c)
to TriFoxMedia’s other information collection, including the
purchase of customer lists from third parties. TriFoxMedia is not
responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of
third web sites or applications.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">By reference, this Privacy Policy is
incorporated into and is subject to the Website Terms of Use. Your
use of the Website and any personal information you provide via the
Website or through other official TriFoxMedia contact remains subject
to this Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms of Use and/or other
stated policies.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1. Collection of Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.1 Survey Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia collects information from
individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when
an individual voluntarily completes an TriFoxMedia survey, order
form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of
online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages
operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As
used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including
the Website, and related technologies, and “offline”
means by methods other than online, including in person, in the
postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar
means.) In the Surveys, TriFoxMedia or a third party (a “Third
Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to
TriFoxMedia, which may include his or her name, email address, street
address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers
and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of
the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and
marital status, occupation, social security number, employment
information, personal and online interests, and such other
information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey
Information”). TriFoxMedia may also collect information
concerning an individual from another source and use that information
in combination with information provided from this Web Site.
Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are
under no obligation to provide Survey Information to TriFoxMedia or
Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from
TriFoxMedia or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey
Information to TriFoxMedia.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.2 Third Party List Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia collects information from
individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party
and TriFoxMedia subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise
acquires the information from the Third Party (the “Seller”).
Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an
individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone
numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging
details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date,
gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation,
industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other
information as the individual may have provided to the Seller
(together, “Third Party List Information”). When
acquiring Third Party List Information, TriFoxMedia seeks assurances
from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third
Party List Information to TriFoxMedia and that the Seller has a right
to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal
information is included on the Seller's list.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.3 Other Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Other occasions when TriFoxMedia
obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual
is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive
offered by TriFoxMedia or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual
requests assistance through TriFoxMedia’s customer service
department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a
TriFoxMedia service or newsletter (together, “Other
Information”).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other
Info Collected Using Technology.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia currently uses cookie and
web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related
information about an individual with information about the individual
in our database. Additionally, TriFoxMedia may use other new and
evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology
Information”).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">(a) Cookies.  A cookie is a small
amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer
that allows TriFoxMedia to identify the individual with his or her
corresponding data that resides in TriFoxMedia’s database. You
may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals
who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the
features and functionality of the Website.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">(b) Web Beacons.  A web beacon is
programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page
(by using an &lt;img src=“x”&gt; programming function --
see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to
transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the
form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with
previously acquired information about an individual in a database.
This allows TriFoxMedia to track certain web sites an individual
visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services
an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral
habits for marketing purposes. For example, TriFoxMedia might place,
with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third
Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an
individual listed in TriFoxMedia’s database, visits the fishing
website, TriFoxMedia receives notice by means of the web beacon that
Joe visited the baseball site, and TriFoxMedia would then update
Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in
baseball. TriFoxMedia may thereafter present offers of baseball
related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web
beacons on web pages, TriFoxMedia also uses web beacons in email
messages sent to individuals listed in TriFoxMedia’s database.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">(c) New Technology.  The use of
technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is
rapidly evolving, as is TriFoxMedia’s use of new and evolving
technology. As a result, TriFoxMedia strongly encourages individuals
to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of
technology.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.5 Outside Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia may receive information
about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of
information outside of TriFoxMedia including information located in
public databases (“Outside Information”).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.6 Individual Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As used herein, Individual Information
means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other
Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any
other information TriFoxMedia gathers or receives about individuals
such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.7 No Information Collected from
Children.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia will never knowingly
collect any personal information about children under the age of 13.
If TriFoxMedia obtains actual knowledge that it has collected
personal information about a child under the age of 13, that
information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it
does not collect such information, TriFoxMedia has no such
information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. TriFoxMedia has
designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">1.8 Credit Card Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia may in certain cases
collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the
expiration date of the card (“Credit Card Information”)
when an individual places an order from TriFoxMedia. When the Credit
Card Information is submitted to TriFoxMedia, such information is
encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. TriFoxMedia
will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and
completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information
will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the
purchase transaction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Log File Data: When users log-in to
access their account, our servers will automatically record and
archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting
a Website. These server logs may include information vital to
validating the user’s authorization to access the account.
Information, such as a Web request, Internet Protocol (the “IP”)
address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages
and visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in
what order, time spent, the date and time of the request, and other
important data is necessary to validate and authorize a user’s
entry and activity on the Website.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2. Use of Individual Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL
INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE
DISCRETION.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The following paragraphs in Section 2
describe how TriFoxMedia currently uses Individual Information, but
TriFoxMedia may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted,
TriFoxMedia may update this policy from time to time. TriFoxMedia may
use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to
individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing,
direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package
stuffers, among other possible uses.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.2 Email.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia uses Individual Information
to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. TriFoxMedia
may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email
recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular
list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email
message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from
all TriFoxMedia’s email lists, a person must send an email to
unsubscribe@trifoxmedia.com.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In certain commercial email messages
sent by TriFoxMedia, an advertiser's name will appear in the “From:”
line but hitting the “Reply” button will cause a reply
email to be sent to TriFoxMedia. The “Subject:” line of
TriFoxMedia email messages will usually contain a line provided from
the advertiser to TriFoxMedia.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.2(b) Solicited Email.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia only sends email to
individuals who have agreed on the Website to receive email from
TriFoxMedia or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party websites
to receive email from Third Parties such as TriFoxMedia. TriFoxMedia
does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes
requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable
to TriFoxMedia’s email messages.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.3 Targeted Advertising.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia uses Individual Information
to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using
the Internet, TriFoxMedia uses Technology Information (see also
Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's
Individual Information, and TriFoxMedia attempts to show advertising
for products and services in which the person has expressed an
interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology
Information, and otherwise. TriFoxMedia may, at its discretion,
target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell
phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional
offers.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.5  Mobile Phone SMS Messaging.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In certain cases, when requested by an
individual, a Third Party may use Individual Information to provide
customized content and advertising via SMS messaging to an
individual’s cell phone.  TriFoxMedia is not responsible for
the privacy practices or the content of such Third Parties. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.6 Use of Technology Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia uses Technology Information
(1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party List
Information to other categories of Individual Information to make and
improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online
browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of
TriFoxMedia’s web sites are most frequently visited. This
information helps TriFoxMedia to better understand the online habits
of individuals so that TriFoxMedia can target advertising and
promotions to them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.7 Profiles of Individuals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia uses Individual Information
to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by
combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with
other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained
from public databases.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">2.8 Storage of Individual Information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">TriFoxMedia stores the Individual
Information in a database on TriFoxMedia computers. Our computers
have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect
against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under
TriFoxMedia’s control. Not withstanding such measures,
TriFoxMedia cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent
TriFoxMedia computers from being illegally accessed, and the
Individual Information on them stolen or altered.</p>
