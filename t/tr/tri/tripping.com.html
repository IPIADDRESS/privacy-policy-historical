This policy applies to our websites and social media accounts (the “Platforms”). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.</p><h2>Information Overview</h2><p>When you visit the Platforms, we may collect information about your visit. This information is anonymized and can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location. This is a standard practice for most websites and it enables us to provide higher quality service for our users.</p><p>If you inquire about an accommodation via the Platforms, we may request additional information from you. Collected only with your consent, this information may include your name, email address and telephone number. </p><p>If you use our Concierge Service, we will collect your travel information so that we can search for accommodations on your behalf. Since we need your contact information in order to help with your accommodations request, we may ask for personal information such as your phone number or email address.</p><p>If you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us. </p><h2>How we collect your Personal Information</h2><p>We collect your personal information directly from you and with your consent. For example, you may provide your personal information (such as your phone number) when you inquire about accommodations. </p><p>We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect anonymized information about you over time and across different Websites when you visit this Platform. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. To learn more about these tools and how to control them, please see below.</p><h2>How we use your Personal Information</h2><p>There are several reasons as to why we may collect your personal information. More than anything, it’s to provide excellent customer service and to consistently improve our Platforms and products. We may also collect it for the below reasons:</p><ol><li>To process your accommodation requests and inquiries.</li><li>To display more relevant advertising and recommendations, or suppress advertising and content that you might find irrelevant.</li><li>To contact you, including as follows:</li></ol><ul><li>» To send confirmations that we’ve received your inquiries;</li><li>» To get in touch if you contact Tripping.com’s Concierge Service;</li><li>» To send you marketing emails from a Tripping.com address regarding our services or those of our partners, provided you have opted-in to receive emails from us or have transacted with us, and as permitted by law. (We hate spam so we’ll always do our best to send emails that are targeted to your interests.)</li></ul><h2>Your Choices</h2><p>Every marketing email has an opt-out URL and you can unsubscribe from such communications at any time. </p><h2>How we share your Personal Information</h2><p>Your privacy is important to us and we will only share information if it’s in your interest provided the other party agrees to protect and not further disclose any of your personal information. With this in mind, we may share information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers that perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information. We may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.</p><p>If you inquire through the Platforms, we may share your personal information with the partners and the accommodation owners you have inquired to. These third parties will process your personal information as data controllers in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p><p>We may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners. We will disclose this in the terms of the sweepstakes so that you have the option to opt-out at any time.</p><p>If Tripping.com itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, the new owners may have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.</p><p>We may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.</p><h2>How we store and protect your Personal Information</h2><p>Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.</p><p>Tripping.com has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third party suppliers, who require such access to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>Cookies and tracking tools</h2><p>Tripping.com uses cookies and tracking tools. To learn more, including how we respond to “Do not track” signals, see below.</p><h2>Other Websites</h2><p>If you click through to third party websites or other platforms, Tripping.com’s privacy policy does not apply on the other websites and platforms.</p><h2>Children</h2><p>Tripping.com does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p><h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2><p>We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. By using our services and Platforms after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them.</p><h2>Accessing and rectifying your Personal Information</h2><p>You are entitled at any time to obtain information about all your personal information that we store, in accordance with applicable law and without any fee. However, in exceptional cases we ask you to pay reasonable fee before we provide the information if permitted by applicable law. We may request proof of your identity before providing this information. We may not be able to allow you to access certain personal information in some cases. For example if your personal information is connected with personal information of other persons, or for legal reasons. In such cases we will provide you with an explanation why you cannot obtain this information. You can also withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information at any time by contacting us at the address below. You can demand deletion or rectification of your personal information, however, statutory provisions, especially those affecting Tripping.com’s accounting, processing of claims, and mandatory data retention, may prohibit deletion or anonymization.</p><p>To exercise your rights, or if you have questions about our privacy practices or need assistance with exercising or understanding your privacy choices, please contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@Tripping.com or you may write to:</p><p>Tripping.com</p><p> Attention: Privacy Officer</p><p>111 New Montgomery St. Floor 5</p><p>San Francisco, CA 94105</p><p>USA</p><p>Cookies and other tracking tools</p><p>We (or our partners and suppliers) use several common tracking tools.
