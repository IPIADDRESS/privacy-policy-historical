	  <h1>Privacy
	    Policy</h1>
	  <p>Thank you for visiting the TriMet website at trimet.org (the "Site")
	    and reviewing our privacy policy. This privacy policy is effective
	    as of December 27, 2006, and applies only to the Site. It is designed
	    to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information
	    you provide to us, and to assist you in making informed decisions when
	    using our Site. TriMet respects the privacy of your personal information.      </p>
	  <p>This privacy policy covers the following areas:&nbsp;</p>
	  <ul class="regular">
	    <li>what information we
	      collect through our Site;</li>
	    <li> how
	      we use the information;</li>
	    <li> with
	      whom we may share the information; </li>
	    <li> what choices you have about
	      our collection, use and disclosure of the information; </li>
	    <li> what security procedures are
	      in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under
	      our control; and </li>
	    <li> how
	      you can correct any inaccuracies in your information.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
	  <h2>1. Information collection</h2>
	  <p>TriMet collects information on the Site at two different stages. First,
	    we use server logs to collect anonymous, aggregate information (such
	    as browser type, ISP, IP address, referring/exit pages, platform type,
	    date/time stamp, number of clicks) from all visitors to the Site. Our
	    Site also uses a standard technology called "cookies" to collect
	    information about how the Site is used. Information gathered
	    through cookies may include the pages viewed and the amount of time spent
	    at the Site. This
	    type of information is typically not linked to any personally identifiable
	    information and is used primarily in the aggregate to generate statistical
	    reports about the use of our Site. TriMet does reserve the right to
	    connect information collected through its server logs with other personally
	    identifiable information.</p>
	  <p>Second, we require certain information when you use services available
	    on the Site. For example, when you contact us by email, we may collect
	    your email address and any other personal information you provide. When
	    you subscribe to one of our electronic newsletters, you must provide
	    your name and a valid email address. You may also provide your address,
	    telephone number and organizational affiliation, and you may choose to
	    create a password for managing your account.&nbsp;If you purchase items
	    from the online store, TriMet and its payment processing partner will
	    collect additional information necessary for payment and delivery. If
	    you apply for employment through the Site, we will collect personal information
	    such as your name, address and other employment-related information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>To unsubscribe from any of our email lists, simply click on the link labeled
	    "Change your account settings" at the bottom of any email from
	    us, or contact us at <a href="mailto:subscriptions@trimet.org">subscriptions@trimet.org</a>.</p>
	  <h2>2. Personal information of children under 13</h2>
	  <p>TriMet complies with the requirements of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection
	    Act (COPPA) and the FTC's Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR ยง 512).&nbsp;The
	    Site is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect any
	    personally identifiable information on&nbsp;the Site from children under
	    13 years of age.</p>
	  <h2>3. Use of your personal information</h2>
	  <p>TriMet does not sell, rent or disclose personally identifiable information
	    to any third party not affiliated with us, except for disclosure to service
	    providers who may assist us in such areas as data storage, and in accordance
	    with Paragraph 4 below. However, users should be aware that TriMet
	    is a public agency and personal information provided to TriMet may be
	    subject to disclosure in accordance with public records laws. Information
	    in anonymous, aggregated form may be shared freely. TriMet will not
	    use your personal information to send you unsolicited commercial offers.
	    However, we may need to contact you for certain purposes, as for example
	    in response to your inquiry, or with a message regarding the status of the
	    Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	  <h2>4. Disclosure of personal information as required by law</h2>
	  <p>We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have
	    a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a current
	    judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, (b) protect
	    and defend our rights, or (c) protect the rights, property, and other interests
	    of our users or others. </p>
	  <h2>5. Links</h2>
	  <p>The Site contains links to other sites. TriMet is not responsible
	    for the privacy practices or content of these other sites. We encourage
	    you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements
	    and terms/conditions of use for each and every site that collects personally
	    identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
	    information collected by the TriMet Site.</p>
	  <h2>6. Security</h2>
	  <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. For example,
	    we encrypt certain communications through our Site with 128-bit encryption,
	    the industry standard for strong encryption. However, given the nature
	    of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible,
	    we cannot guarantee the security of your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>If you have any questions about the security at our Site, you can send
	    a message to the webmaster at <a href="mailto:webmaster@trimet.org">webmaster@trimet.org</a>. </p>
	  <h2>7. Correcting, updating, deleting and deactivating personal information </h2>
	  <p>If your information changes, you may contact us to correct, update or delete
	    and deactivate our records.&nbsp; </p>
	  <h2>8. Notification of changes</h2>
	  <p>TriMet may modify the terms of this privacy policy at any time by updating
	    this posting. If&nbsp;this privacy policy changes materially
	    so that we are going to use your personally identifiable information
	    in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, or
	    if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that affect
	    customer information already stored in our database, we will prominently
	    post a notice on the main page and other pages to alert you about the
	    change. You
	    should check the Site periodically to remain informed of the latest version
	    of the privacy policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	  <h2>9. Contact information</h2>
