<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<br><br>
Welcome to the Tripology website (the "Website"), the place that connects travelers to travel agents. Tripology, Inc. ("we", "us" or "our") has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to respecting your privacy (the "Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use your personally identifiable information ("PII") and other information in operating the Website.
<a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.tripology.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank"><img src="/static/images/truste_seal_ctv.gif" border="0" align="right" alt=""></a>
<br><br>
<em>The effective date of this Privacy Policy is September 5, 2007.</em>
<br><br>
<strong>How does the Website Work?</strong><br>
The Website offers users ("Users") the opportunity to submit a trip request ("Trip Request") that includes contact information and trip details which, when submitted are passed on to Travel Agents (as defined below). The Trip Request is used to match Users with Travel Agents so Travel Agents can contact Users with respect to their Trip Request. Portions of the Website are also available to anonymous browsers ("Visitors") who, along with Users, are referred to herein as "you" or "your".
<br><br>
By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your PII and non-PII by us as described herein.
<br><br>
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, a "Travel Agent" is any person or entity who acts as an agent of a supplier of, sells or offers for sale any travel, transportation or vacation arrangements.
<br><br>
<strong>What type of PII do we collect from you and how do we use it? </strong><br>
Users must provide certain PII to us in order to submit a Trip Request.  Such PII includes basic biographical information, such as your name, postal address and email address. We may also ask you for non-PII about yourself and your interests. Unless you provide PII to us through the Website, we will not collect any PII from you.
<br><br>
We will provide your PII -- first name, last name, email address, and phone number (only if provided) -- to Travel Agents. These Travel Agents may use your PII to help fulfill your Trip Request. Because we have no control over such Travel Agents, the collection and use of your PII and other information by such Travel Agents shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such Travel Agents and not this Privacy Policy. You should instruct the Travel Agents directly regarding your preferences for the use of PII by them. In addition, we may use your PII to communicate with you about your Trip Request in the provision of our services.
<br><br>
We do not share, sell, rent or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.
<br><br>
We occasionally post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain PII such as the customer's name.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
<br><br>
If you use a blog on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the PII you choose to submit in these forums.
<br><br>
<strong>Under what other circumstances may we release PII?</strong><br>
We may also release your PII to persons other than Travel Agents if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g. a subpoena, court order or other similar legal process or statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our Terms and Conditions, to protect our rights or property, to protect you from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or if we reasonably believes that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII.
<br><br>
<strong>What other information do we collect?</strong><br>
In addition to obtaining PII, when you use our site, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the Website. We get this information by using technologies, including cookies and web beacons to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of the Website and to better tailor the Website to our visitors' needs. None of this tracking information identifies you personally; we collect it for reporting onsite activity in the aggregate. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on the Website or which pages or features get the most attention. We may share anonymous, aggregated information about you with third parties.
<br><br>
<strong>Do I have the ability not to be identified by us?</strong><br>
Yes. If you do not want to be identified by us, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence.  You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies.  If you do not want us to have any of your PII, do not submit any of your PII to us.
<br><br>
<strong>How do we store information?</strong><br>
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect any PII from unauthorized access and improper use. Please note that despite our efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.
<br><br>
Please be aware that communications over the internet, such as emails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorized access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.
<br><br>
<strong>What is the site's policy regarding public forums?</strong><br>
We may from time to time make available forums available to you and may request you to submit feedback, reviews and ratings with respect to your experiences in using our services and those of the Travel Agents matched with your Trip Request. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
<br><br>
<strong>Do we provide links to other websites?</strong><br>
We may from time to time make available forums available to you and may request you to submit feedback, reviews and ratings with respect to your experiences in using our services and those of the Travel Agents matched with your Trip Request. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
<br><br>
<strong>What are our policies regarding children?</strong><br>
You must be eighteen (18) years of age or older in order to submit a Trip Request.  We will not knowingly collect PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age.
<br><br>
<strong>Are we a Licensee of TRUSTe Privacy Program?</strong><br>
	Yes. We are a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This Privacy Policy covers the Website at <a href="http://www.tripology.com">www.tripology.com</a>. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices with respect to the Website and have them reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.
<br><br>
	If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should first contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tripology.com">privacy@tripology.com</a>. If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.
<br><br>
<strong>Can we make changes to the Privacy Policy?</strong><br>
Yes. We reserve the right to change how we handle the information we collect and process through the Website at any time.  We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any material changes and such changes will take effect immediately once posted. We will notify you of these changes here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Website or use any of our services to make sure that you understand how your information will be used.
<br><br>
<strong>Do we have a mechanism to address the review and removal of PII and complaints about the handling of information that it collects?</strong><br>
We give you the opportunity to modify your account information you have provided to us at anytime by going to the My Account section of the Website or you may email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tripology.com">privacy@tripology.com</a>. Please be aware that it may take several hours or days for the changes you make to take effect. We thank you for your patience. Please note that changing or deleting your information will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future activities on the Website and for managing future communications from us. These changes and deletions will not change information that we may have already forwarded to Travel Agents, as provided above in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
If you have questions or concerns about any of our information collection or handling practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tripology.com">privacy@tripology.com</a> or you may contact us by writing to Tripology, Inc., 160 Madison Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10016.
