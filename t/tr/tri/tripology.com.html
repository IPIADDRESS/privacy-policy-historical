<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>


<p>This is the Privacy Policy Statement for Tripology, a service of RM Acquisition, LLC d/b/a Rand McNally ("Tripology")</p>

<p>At Tripology your trust and satisfaction is of the utmost importance. Because we respect your privacy, we have instituted policies intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy Statement applies only to information collected through Tripology’s website. We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy Statement periodically as we may update it from time to time. This Policy was last revised on March 23, 2010.  Capitalized terms are as defined in the Terms of Service Between Travel Consumer and Tripology and the Terms and Conditions Between Travel Professional and Tripology which are available on Tripology’s website at http://www.tripology.com.
</p>

<h2>What is the site's policy regarding public forums?</h2>
<p>
We may from time to time make available forums available to you and may request you to submit feedback, reviews and ratings with respect to your experiences in using our services and those of the Travel Agents and/or Travel Suppliers matched with your Trip Request. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
Do we provide links to other websites?
We may from time to time make available links to other websites available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
</p>

<h2>Third party merchants "Presented by Tripology"</h2>
<p>
If you make a purchase from a Merchant Site with a link originating from the Tripology site or a Merchant catalog or website "presented by" Tripology, the information you provide to that Merchant, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the Merchant and not to Tripology. Providing this information to the Merchant enables the transaction to take place. However, you should know that the Merchant may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Tripology. You should also know that these Merchants have their own privacy and data collection practices and are not covered by the Tripology Privacy Policy Statement.
</p>

<p>Merchants on the Tripology site and those Merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Tripology have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding Merchants appearing on Tripology or other Merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Tripology and their privacy policies, please see the Merchant's home page and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from the Merchant.</p>

<p>Merchants that have links on the Tripology site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of these Merchants are not covered by the Tripology Privacy Policy Statement.</p>

<h2>How do you know your information is secure and how is it stored? </h2>
<p>
When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon in your browser window, then your site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer.  We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your information on our site. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact your Internet service provider. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, we will redirect you to a secure server and notify you through a pop-up screen on our site. </p>

<p>We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site so you can feel comfortable and secure. </p>

<p>Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers. </p>
<p>
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect any Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and improper use. Please note that despite our efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>

Please note that despite our efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>
<p>Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorized access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy </h2>
<p>
You must be at least the age of eighteen (18 years old) to submit a Trip Request. Tripology does not seek to solicit information from anyone under the age of thirteen (a "Child"). If a Child submits information to us through any part of our Website, and we know that the person submitting the information is a Child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. If your Child has submitted personal information to us and you would like to request that such information be removed from our customer lists, you may contact us using the “contact us” information listed below, and we will honor your request. </p>

<h2>How can you update your information? </h2>

<p>
We will provide you access to the following information if you send us an email, call us or write to us: <br>
financial information (such as your credit card account information) <br>
unique identifier information (your customer number or password) <br>
transaction information (dates on which you made purchases, amounts and types of purchases) <br>
contact information (your name, address, phone number) <br>
We will evaluate each request and reply in an appropriate manner and form of communication that respects the security of the information you have requested. Please read the section of this Privacy Policy Statement regarding our Contact Information and how to contact us. <br>
</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy Statement </h2>
<p>
From time to time, we may use the information you provide us for new, unanticipated uses not previously addressed in our Privacy Policy Statement. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes on the privacy page of our Website to notify you of these changes, and the revised Privacy Policy Statement will apply to all of your personal information that we have on file, provided, however, that we will continue to honor any past requests not to share your information with third parties. You should check our Website periodically for more information on how we use the data we collect. </p>

<p>If there is a material change in the manner we use data we collect, we will update this Privacy Policy Statement to reflect these changes. </p>

<h2>Newsletters</h2>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at contact@tripology.com. We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications by clicking on "My Account" and de-selecting the newsletter opt-in and clicking "Save," by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in our communications, by calling us at 800-924-0722 or by sending us postal mail at Tripology / Rand McNally - 9855 Woods Drive, Skokie, IL 60077 USA.</p>

<h2>Conflict in terms </h2>
<p>
It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Policy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Policy Statement into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Policy Statement upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Policy Statement. For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Policy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices. </p>
