Further, we will disclose information we maintain, including personally identifiable information, when required to do so by law, or may disclose such information in response to a request from a law enforcement agency or authority.</li>
                        <li><u>Third Party Payment Processors</u>.  If you choose to purchase products available via the Site using our third party payment processors, you may be required to provide personally identifiable information to credit card companies, PayPal or other third party payment processors for the purpose of facilitating the payment for your purchase.

                <p>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES</p>
                <p>Triumph may reference, provide links to or include features or functionality on the Site that connect or link to third party websites, services or servers. We are not responsible for these third party websites, services and servers, and you should review the privacy policies posted on such sites or otherwise available for such services. In this regard, as noted above, to the extent any credit card payment information (including the number, security code and expiration date) is submitted by you in connection with your use of the Site, such information is not collected by Triumph but rather is sent directly to a third party payment processor. In addition, we use a third party service provider in connection with our ratings and review feature on our Site and such provider collects user information from the Site. The applicable privacy policy for the service provider providing the ratings and review feature can be found at <a href="http://bazaarvoice.com/privacy-policy">http://bazaarvoice.com/privacy-policy</a>. Triumph may use additional service providers, which similarly collect user information and have their own privacy policies, to provide specific Site features or functionality in the future. Please be aware that Triumph does not control, nor are we responsible for, the privacy policies or information practices of any such third parties (such as third party payment processors or providers of our ratings and review feature or other features) or their websites or services. <b>By using a specific feature or functionality, you consent to the transfer, collection and use of your information to or by the third party service provider providing such feature or functionality</b>.</p>
                <p>MODIFICATIONS</p>
                <p>We strive to maintain the accuracy of any personally identifiable information that may be collected from you, and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to update our database when you tell us the information in our database is not accurate.  It is your responsibility to ensure that such information is accurate, complete and up-to-date.  If you wish to make any changes to any personally identifiable information you have provided to us, you may do so at any time by logging into your customer account, if applicable, and making any such changes, or by contacting us via email at <a href="mailto:info@shop-us.triumph.com">info@shop-us.triumph.com.</a></p>
                <p>OPT IN / OPT OUT</p>
                <p>The Site allows you to opt in to receive our newsletter and/or other information and materials from us and our affiliates regarding our products and services.  If you choose to opt in to receive such materials or communications, you may at any time opt out of receiving such materials and communications by following the opt-out link provided in any email received.  Please note, however, that after you unsubscribe from our newsletter, we may still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and/or products you have purchased.  For example, even if you have unsubscribed from our newsletter, we will still send you emails confirming your account preferences.</p>
                <p>CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING INFORMATION</p>
                <p>You may choose not to provide us with your personally identifiable information.  However, choosing not to provide certain requested personally identifiable information may prevent you from accessing and taking advantage of certain products and/or services offered by Triumph.</p>
                <p>CHILDREN</p>
                <p>This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13.  Accordingly, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-06 and 16 C.F.R. §§ 312.1-312.12, we will not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.  In addition, we do not permit children under 18 years of age to purchase products or to register for an account on the Site.  <b><u>By using the Site, you represent that you are not under 13 years of age.  Further, by registering for an account with Triumph and/or purchasing products via the Site, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age, and have the right to form legally binding contracts and to perform your obligations hereunder</u></b>. </p>
                <p>PROTECTING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</p>
                <p>Because security is important to both Triumph and you, we maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  Industry standard Internet security methods and technologies, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, are used in an effort to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. SSL encrypts the transmissions from our ecommerce servers as well as your computer. SSL encryption works by forming a matched pair with the transmission from your computer transmission and our server, so that only data to and from these sources can be valid. If you are a registered user, typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted.  For certain categories of data, we may also tell you from time to time about specific data retention practices.  You should not share your account password with anyone.  In addition, if you suspect unauthorized access to your account information, it is your responsibility to contact Triumph immediately.  Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or the policies of the Site and our service providers).</p>
                <p>BUSINESS TRANSFER</p>
                <p>Triumph may, in the future, sell or otherwise transfer some or all of its assets to a third party.  Your personally identifiable information and/or technical information we obtain from you via the Site may be disclosed to any potential or actual third party purchasers of such assets and/or may be among those assets transferred.</p>
                <p>ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS </p>
                <p>This Privacy Statement is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Triumph Terms of Use.

If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Site.</p>
                <p>INTERNATIONAL USERS - APPLICABLE LAW</p>
                <p>We collect, process, store, use, disclose, and dispose of personal information that you submit to us in accordance with applicable United States law. Please note that the personal information you submit to our Site will be transferred to the United States to be processed by us in order to provide the Site and our services to you or for such other purposes as set forth in this Privacy Statement. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect, process, store, use, disclose and dispose your personal information, as discussed in this Privacy Statement, outside your resident jurisdiction, and it is your responsibility for ensuring whether such actions and the sharing of information with Triumph through the Site conforms to all local data protection laws applicable to you. In this regard, please be aware that United States law may offer different levels of protection for personal information than may be available in your country.</p>
