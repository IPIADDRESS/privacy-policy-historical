<p>
  The following Privacy Policy ("Policy") summarizes the various
  ways that Concur Technologies, Inc., and its subsidiaries, and
  other affiliated and related companies ("Concur" or "us" or "we")
  use the information you provide to us or we gather from you while
  you access or use the website at <a href="/">www.tripit.com</a>  (the "Site"), our mobile applications ("App"), and our related sites and
  online services (collectively, the "Services"). It is our goal to provide you
  with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same
  time, respect your privacy.
</p>
<p>
  Please read this Policy carefully. Your access to or use of any part
  of the Services will constitute your notice about our collection, use,
  and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Policy. If
  you do not wish for us to collect, use, and disclose your information
  in accordance with this Policy, please do not access or use the Services.
  This Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including,
  without limitation, offline or on sites linked to through the Services.
  We may add to or amend this Policy with other notices.  We may also post
  different privacy statements for some Services, and when we do so, this
  Policy does not apply. For example, separate policies and terms apply to
  information collected through our concur.com site and platform or our other
  mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
  This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the
  Services and does not apply to any third-party activities, including
  third-party websites linked from our Services, third-party social
  networking platforms or features we make available through our Services,
  or third-party ads displayed on our Services. We are not responsible for
  the privacy practices or content of such third parties. We encourage you
  to read the privacy statements of those third parties.
</p>
<p>
  The Site has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy
  policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with
  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program requirements</a>,
  including transparency, accountability, and choice regarding the
  collection and use of your personal information.  The TRUSTe program
  does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable
  software.   TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to
  accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through
  its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. The TRUSTe
  certification covers only information collected through <a href="/">www.tripit.com</a>  and does not cover information that may be collected through other Concur
  websites or our mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
  If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first
  contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tripit.com">support@tripit.com</a>. If
  contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe

  or by fax at 415-520-3420, or mail to TRUSTe Safe Harbor Compliance Dept.

  the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like
  the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For information about TRUSTe or the operation

</p>
<h2>1. What Information We Collect from You</h2>
<p>
  When you register with Concur or use our Services, we ask for your email
  address and password, name, home location, billing or mailing address,
  phone numbers, and other email addresses as well as other information
  including your travel information, history, preferences, and other demographic
  information. If you wish to purchase additional services we may collect
  your financial information (for example your credit card number, expiration
  date). If you also select to have Concur track your travel rewards points,
  Concur will store account details for each of your travel rewards points
  accounts including each account's login username and password. If you wish,
  you can also store in your Traveler Profile information about your emergency
  contact details and government issued identification numbers needed for
  travel, for example, your passport identification number, driver’s license
  number, and/or known traveler number.
</p>
<h3>Information We Automatically Collect About Visits and Usage</h3>
<p>
  For all Site visitors or App users, not just registered users, we collect
  information such as IP address, device identifier, browser type, device
  type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform,
  new and repeat information, time stamp, exit page information, and other
  information about how you use the Service.
</p>
<p>
  We use analytics, including analytics conducted by third-party services,
  to help analyze how users use the Services. To do this, we and our third-party
  service providers use <em>cookies</em> (unique identifiers sent to your computer
  by a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive) and scripts to collect
  and store information such as how users interact with our Services, errors users
  encounter when using our Services, device identifiers, how often and for how
  long users visit and use the Services, which pages they visit on our Services,
  whether they act on or open emails, and what other sites they used prior to coming
  to the Site. We use this information to improve our site and your user experience,
  such as remembering you when you return and log in, reducing the time it takes
  for you to create an itinerary, and knowing which of our web pages are visited
  and which services are most often used.
</p>
<h3>Email Auto-Import</h3>
<p>
  You may associate your email accounts with the Service by providing us with
  log-in credentials for your email accounts. Once you have authorized us to do
  so by associating your accounts, we will use our automated technology to
  regularly review the contents of emails in your email accounts to look for
  travel and travel-rewards related emails, including those with information about
  recent bookings or reward-program statements. This information collected from
  your emails will be added to your TripIt account so that you may automatically
  access this information on the Service and so that we may use this information
  for other purposes described in this Policy.
</p>
<h3>Import Contacts and Tell-a-Friend</h3>
<p>
  We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your
  contacts and other members of Concur. We make it easy for you to invite
  people from your email address books and contact lists to join our Service
  and connect with you on our Site or to help find people who have already
  joined our Service. We do this at your request, by importing your email
  address books and contact lists to our servers. You may also provide us with
  an individual friend’s email address so that we may send them an invitation
  to visit the Service.
</p>
<h3>Location Data</h3>
<p>
  We may collect precise geolocation data through our Services. We may use
  this information as described in this Policy, including, for example, to
  provide you with offers or opportunities based upon your location and travel
  plans.
</p>
<h2>2. What Information Others May Collect about You </h2>
<p>
  Other third parties may collect information about you through our Services,
  including personally identifiable information about your online activities
  over time and across different websites when you use our Services. We describe
  some of those activities below, but understand that our Policy does not cover
  these or any other third parties, their products, actions, or their services.
  We cannot control how third parties collect, use, or secure your data. For
  information about third-party privacy practices, please consult their privacy
  policies.
</p>
<h3>Third-Party Sign-In and Social-Media Features</h3>
<p>
  You can log in to our Services using sign-in services provided by third
  parties, including certain third-party social networking platforms.
  Certain third-party services we may feature through our Services give you
  social media options to interact with buttons or widgets that let you like
  information or post information about your activities from our Site to third
  party sites and platforms publicly or within your network.  These services
  will share certain personal information with us as described in the sign-in
  notices or in their privacy policies.
</p>
<h3>Third-Party Advertising</h3>
<p>
  We may use third parties to serve ads in our Services. These third parties
  may automatically collect information about your use of the Services, visits
  to our websites and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, and the browser
  you use to visit our website (but not your name, address, email address, or
  telephone number). Third parties may collect information by using cookies,
  clear gifs, or other technologies. These third parties may use this information
  to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand
  the usage and visitation of the Services and the other websites tracked by
  these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible
  for, cookies or clear gifs in third-party ads. We encourage you to check the
  privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of
  cookies and other technology. If you want more information about this practice
  and about your choices for many of our ad networks, go to the
  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">TRUSTe website</a>.
</p>
<h3>Our Ads on Third-Party Websites</h3>
<p>
  We and our third-party partners may use information collected using third-party
  cookies and web beacons on our Services and in our emails to deliver ads about
  our Services displayed to you on third-party websites and applications. We also
  may use cookie information and other methods to know when you return to our
  Services after visiting these third-party websites and applications. We use this
  and other information about you to try to understand your interests and show you
  relevant advertising about products and services that may interest you. Our third
  party partners may also use this information for third-party advertising as
  described above.
</p>
<h3>Flash LSOs</h3>
<p>
  When we post videos or other media on our blog, third parties may use local shared
  objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences for volume control,
  or to personalize certain features. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies
  because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie-management tools
  provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy
  and storage settings for Flash cookies, go to the
  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">Macromedia website</a>.
</p><h2>3. How Your Information Is Used</h2>
<p>
  In addition to the uses described in this policy, we may use personal information
  about you to create and maintain your travel itineraries and your travel profile,
  send you marketing messages about our Services and products and services of our partners,
  and otherwise provide you with and improve the Services. We also use the information
  that we gather to personalize and customize experience, content, marketing, and
  recommendations across all our Services, including to target content on our Services
  to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive email
  communication from us, target email marketing messages that are more appropriate to
  your needs. We may use your personal information to respond to your comments and
  questions and provide customer service; send you information related to your requests
  and purchases, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security
  alerts, and support and administrative messages; communicate with you about contests,
  promotions, rewards, upcoming events, and process and deliver contest entries and rewards;
  link or combine your personal information with other information we get about your use of
  other Services and from third parties to help understand you and your needs, and provide
  you with recommendations, better service, and customized marketing; and protect, investigate,
  and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.
</p>
<h2>4. How Your Information Is Protected</h2>
<p>
  We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed
  to promote the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable
  information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic
  storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
  acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
  absolute security.
</p>
<h2>5. How Your Information Is Shared</h2>
<p>
  When you use the Service, your personal information and your travel information
  will be shared with the third parties you designate for access to such information,
  including other companies, websites, mobile applications, your friends, relatives,
  and business associates. Depending upon the type of access you grant to such third
  parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us
  and to designate others to access and edit such information. You may change who has
  access to your information by going to your account settings and then changing your
  publishing options.
</p>
<p>
  You may choose to display certain information you give us in your public profile.
  Our Site also offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be
  aware that any information you choose to share in these areas may be read, collected,
  and used by others. To request removal of your content or information from our blog
  or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tripit.com">support@tripit.com</a>.
  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case
  we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
</p>
<p>
  In general, most of your travel-related information, such as upcoming destinations
