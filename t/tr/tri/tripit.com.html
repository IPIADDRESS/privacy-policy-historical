Privacy Policy <span style="font-size: 12px;">(last revised March 27, 2009)</span>
</h2>
<br>

<p>
  The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that we use
  the information you provide to us or we gather from you while you
  use the tripit.com online service (the "Service"), as provided by
  TripIt, Inc. ("TripIt" or "us" or "we"), at www.tripit.com (the
  "Site"). It is our goal to provide you with information that is
  tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect
  your privacy.
</p>
<p>
  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of any part of
  the Service will constitute your agreement to this Privacy
  Policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this
  Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. This Privacy Policy
  does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without
  limitation, offline or on sites linked to through the Service.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our
  <a href="/uhp/userAgreement">User Agreement</a>. Your use of
  the Service constitutes agreement to the User Agreement as well.
</p>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of
  the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back
  often. In the event that we make material changes to this Privacy
  Policy, we will place a prominent notice on the Site informing our
  users of such changes. Continued use of the Service by you will
  constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the
  Privacy Policy.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><h3>What Information We Collect from You</h3></li>
  
  <p>
    When you register with TripIt, we ask for the basics including
    your name, email address and password and allow you to provide us
    with other information including your travel information, history
    and preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all Site visitors, not just registered users, we collect
    information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, access
    times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat
    information, time stamp and exit page information.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you contact us, we also will collect the information you
    provide that details the nature of your question or problem to
    enhance the quality of our Service.
  </p>

  <li><h3>What Organization Is Collecting the Information</h3></li>
  <p>
    TripIt, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates and manages
    <a href="/">www.tripit.com</a>. More information about us
    may be found at <a href="/uhp/aboutUs">About Us</a>.
  </p>

  <li><h3>How Your Information Is Protected</h3></li>
  <p>
    We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures
    that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of
    user information. Current Internet security methods and
    technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain
    data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.
  </p>

  <li><h3>When We May Share Your Information</h3></li>
  <p>
    The information we gather is used to create and maintain your
    travel itineraries and your travel profile and, if you have
    elected to receive them, send you marketing messages. We also use
    the information that we gather to target content on our Site to
    more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to
    receive email communication from us, target email marketing
    messages that are more appropriate to your needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you use the Service, the personal information you provide
    will be shared with the third parties you designate for access to
    such information including other web sites, your friends,
    relatives and business associates. Depending upon the type of
    access you grant to such third parties, they may also be permitted
    to edit the information you have provided to us and to designate
    others to access and edit such information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain portions of the information you provide to us also may be
    displayed in your public profile. As an essential element of the
    services we offer, most of the personal information you explicitly
    provide to us when you register or update your profile is
    displayed on your public profile. Once displayed on
    publicly-viewable web pages, that information can be collected and
    used by others.  We cannot control who reads your posting or what
    other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so
    it is very important that you do not put personally identifiable
    or other private information in your posts.  Once you have posted
    information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and
    delete it on the Site, you will not be able to edit or delete such
    information cached, collected and stored elsewhere by others
    (e.g., search engines).
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, most of your travel related information, such as
    upcoming destinations and travel statistics, is displayed only to
    other TripIt members to whom you have specifically connected as
    part of your TripIt network. You can change your privacy settings
    to designate which types of information are shared and with whom
    by visiting the <a href="https://www.tripit.com/account/edit/section/your_profile">Profile and Privacy</a> page.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, we may share your personal information as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or
      take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities;
      to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of TripIt,
      our users or others; and in connection with the enforcement of
      our User Agreement.</li>
    <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a
      divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the
      unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
    <li>With business firms contracted to provide specific services to
      us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In
      situations such as this where your data is shared with a
      third-party firm, the firm will be contractually obligated to
      use your personal data only for the purpose for which our
      relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the
      right to share your data with other organizations or contact you
      outside the bounds of their contract with us.</li>
    <li>If we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so
      by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the
      rights, property, or safety of TripIt or others. This includes,
      but is not limited to, fraud, technical malfunctions or abuse of
      our network or systems. We also may provide user information to
      third parties for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise
      in the normal course of business.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    From time to time, we also may share general information about our
    Site and visitors such as the number of visitors, aggregate and
    non-personally identifiable demographic and travel data, etc.,
    with our advertisers and partners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal
    information about you will be shared with third parties, and you
    will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such
    information.
  </p>
  <li><h3>What Choices Are Available to You on the Site</h3></li>
  <p>
    Registration is optional. If you choose not to register, certain
    features of the Service and sections of our Site may be
    inaccessible but you will be able view the main pages of the
    Site. Registration and login are required to prepare an itinerary
    using our Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <a href="https://www.tripit.com/account/edit">Settings</a> section you
    may make changes to your account and change your email address,
    password, privacy settings, or contact information. You may also
    subscribe or unsubscribe for certain communications from us as
    explained in more detail in Section 6 below and in the User
    Agreement. Registration and login are required to access these
    account settings.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Email Communication You Choose to Receive from Us</h3></li>
  <p>
    With the exception of emails confirming registration, emails that
    include information about your account, invitation requests from
    other TripIt users, emails relating directly to an itinerary or
    travel profile created through the Service, and service
    announcements and administrative messages that are considered part
    of your account membership, we will not send you any emails unless
    you opt-in to receive communications from us. If you opt-in to
    receive communications from us, you will receive information we
    believe will be of use and interest to you. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will update you on any important functionality changes to
      our Service via email.</li>
    <li>We will keep you informed about TripIt promotions,
      sweepstakes, programs, etc., and other special offers that we
      think you will find valuable.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you decide that you are no longer interested in receiving email
    communications from us, you have several choices for opting out of
    future mailings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may follow the instructions in our emails on how to
      unsubscribe yourself from our email list.</li>
    <li>You may click on <a href="https://www.tripit.com/account/edit">Settings</a> at the top of any page on our Site and update your Email
      Subscription settings.</li>
    <li>You may send us a letter at 444 De Haro Street, Suite 130, San
      Francisco, CA 94107.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You may also permanently close your TripIt account from the My
    Account section of the site. In addition, you may request to be
    added to the TripIt "blacklist," which will prevent you from
    receiving future email from TripIt, for any reason. Send an email
    to support@tripit.com to request to be
    added to the blacklist.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Cookies</h3></li>
  <p>
    A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web
    server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a
    computer server identify your computer. A cookie is what allows
    many sites to greet you upon every return with a personalized
    message even before you actively login. We use cookies to improve
    your user experience and reduce the time it takes for you to
    create an itinerary. Our cookies do not include any sensitive
    information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are
    visited and what services are most often used. You may choose not
    to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse
    cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please be
    aware, however, that by refusing to accept cookies, you will be
    unable to access a significant portion of the Site and unable to
    use a significant portion of the Service.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Third-Party Advertising</h3></li>
  <p>
    From time to time, we may use a third-party advertising company to
    serve advertising on our behalf. Through the use of technology
    devices commonly referred to as cookies and action tags, this
    third-party ad-serving company can measure the effectiveness of
    our ads. We do not have access to the third-party server's
    cookies, which are similar to our own cookies. The third-party ad
    server employs an action tag (also known as a Web Beacon or a
    one-pixel .gif file) to set or read cookies. The third-party ad
    server may also receive specific information about your use of the
    Service and use information about your visits to this and other
    Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
    services of interest to you.  Rest assured that this shared
    information is anonymous and does not contain any personally
    identifiable information, i.e. such information does not include
    your name, address, email address, or telephone number. You can
    find out more about third-party advertisers and explore the option
    of not having this information collected by clicking
    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">here</a>.
  </p>

  <li><h3>Sweepstakes</h3></li>
  <p>
    We may occasionally offer Site visitors an opportunity to
    participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes. Information we
    collect for such a survey, contest or sweepstakes will be subject
    to the same protection as the information we generally collect
    from our users.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Testimonials and User Feedback</h3></li>
  <p>
    We often receive testimonials and comments from users who have had
    positive experiences with our Service. We occasionally publish
    such content. When we publish this content, we may identify our
    users by their first name and the first letter of their last name
    and may also indicate their home city.  Please note that
    testimonials and comments are considered "Feedback" that is
    subject to the <a href="/uhp/userAgreement">User Agreement</a>.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Children</h3></li>
  <p>
    Children are not eligible to use the Service and we ask that
    minors (anyone under the age of 18) not submit any personal
    information to us. We do not knowingly collect personal
    information from anyone under the age of 18 or permit them to use
    our Service.
  </p>
  <li><h3>International Users - Applicable Law</h3></li>
  <p>
    We collect, process, store, disclose and dispose of personal
    information that you submit to us in accordance with applicable
    United States law. Please note that the personal information you
    submit to our Service will be transferred to the United States to
    be processed by us in order to provide this Site and the Service
    to you or for such other purposes as set forth in this Privacy
    Policy. If you are not a resident of the United States, you
    acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal
    information, as discussed in this Privacy Policy, outside your
    resident jurisdiction. In addition, we may store such personal
    information in the United States, outside your resident
    jurisdiction. In particular, you are advised that the United
    States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on
    a mix of legislation, governmental regulation and
    self-regulation. Please be aware that United States law may offer
    different levels of protection for personal information than may
    be available in your country.
