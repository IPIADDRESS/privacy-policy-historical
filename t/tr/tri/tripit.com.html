<h1 class="pgHdr" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">TripIt Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="pgInt">
  Effective: May 22, 2018</p>

<p>
    This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Concur Technologies, Inc., Concur Holdings (Netherlands) B.V., and
    their affiliated companies through the TripIt business unit ("TripIt" or "us" or "we") collect, use, and share the
    information you provide to us or we gather from you while you access or use www.tripit.com (the "Site"), the TripIt
    mobile application (the "App"), and related services that link to this Policy (together, the “TripIt Services”).
</p>

<p>
    We may also supplement this Policy with other privacy notices in the TripIt Services.  This Policy applies only to
    information collected by us through the TripIt Services and does not apply to services that link to other privacy
    policies, including any third-party websites or services you connect to from our TripIt Services, such as
    social-networking platforms or connected third-party applications.  TripIt is not responsible for the privacy
    practices or content of such third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those third parties.
</p>
<p>
    We collect and process personal information about you with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products
    you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and
    our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.
</p>

<h2>Personal Data Collected</h2>

<p>
    As used in this Policy, “Personal Data” means information relating to you as an identified or identifiable
    individual.  You provide Personal Data directly into the TripIt Services.  For example, as part of activating an
    account with TripIt, we collect your name, email address and password, and home airport or country.  If you create
    the account using one of the available social networking or third-party platform connection options
    (a “social sign-in” like Google, Facebook, or Yahoo), we will collect your associated email address and related
    profile information from the social sign-in provider.  You may also identify your company or employer, as well as
    provide a photo of yourself. You may also provide us with additional email addresses for purposes of collecting
    itinerary information and to ensure that you retain access to your account even if you no longer have access to
    your primary email address.
</p>
<p>
    To take full advantage of features and functionality of the TripIt Services, you may also provide us with
    additional information for your profile, such as date of birth, or your travel preferences, like seat and meal
    preference.  And you may input emergency contact details and government-issued identification numbers needed for
    travel, such as your passport or driver license number.  This information helps you to keep your itinerary and
    travel information in one place.  If you wish to receive alerts via text messages, you must provide your mobile
    phone number.  If you purchase additional TripIt Services, such as upgrading your account to TripIt Pro, we will
    collect certain billing and payment information.  We process any payments using third parties, and we would retain
    only the last four digits of your credit card number and expiration date. Some services may not be available or
    function correctly if you are not willing to provide personal information.
</p>
<p>
    We may also collect Personal Data from other sources and combine that with Personal Data we collect from you
    through the TripIt Services, as described below.
</p>

<h3>Company SAP Concur Account</h3>
<p>
    If your company has enabled you to connect the SAP Concur account you use
    through your company (“SAP Concur Account”) with your TripIt Services account, by allowing the TripIt Services to
    access your SAP Concur Account, the TripIt Services will have access to account profile, itineraries, and traveler
    preferences contained within your SAP Concur Account.  The TripIt Services may use and store this Personal Data
    and combine it with other Personal Data maintained by the TripIt Services.  Travel itineraries available to your
    SAP Concur Account will also be collected into your TripIt Services account so that you may manage these
    itineraries with the TripIt Services.
</p>

<h3>Third-Party Connected Services</h3>
<p>
    The TripIt Services also enable you to connect your TripIt Services
    account with third-party applications and service providers.  You can find information about many of these
    applications within the “Supported Apps” portion of the Site, and third-party applications that connect to the
    TripIt Services will usually indicate that they connect to the TripIt Services.  These connected third-party
    applications may enable Personal Data about you to be transferred into the TripIt Services.  For example, if you
    book airline travel using a connected third-party application from the airline, the corresponding booking
    information may be transferred into the TripIt Services. Your use of any third-party applications is subject to
    the terms and conditions you have agreed to with such third parties, including third-party privacy notices, and
    TripIt is not responsible for the quality or accuracy of third-party data available to the TripIt Services from
    third parties.
</p>

<h3>Connecting Your Email and Reward Accounts</h3>
<p>
    You can choose to enable us to access one or more of your
    email accounts by connecting such account(s) with your TripIt account. If you connect your email account, the
    TripIt Services will automatically access and analyze the contents of emails in your email account(s) on an ongoing
    basis for the purpose of identifying travel and travel-reward related emails that may contain recent travel
    bookings, boarding passes, or reward-program statements.  Once identified, travel itinerary and reward-program
    information is then extracted from your emails into your TripIt Services account so that you may access this
    information in the TripIt Services.  TripIt’s access to the email account is authorized through the email
    provider’s access mechanism.  If you choose to have the TripIt Services track your travel-reward points, the
    TripIt Services will store account details for each of your travel-reward accounts, including your sign-in user
    name and password for tracked accounts. This information will be used to enable the TripIt Services, directly
    or indirectly through third-party service providers, to automatically access your applicable reward accounts
    and analyze and extract information from such accounts for use in the TripIt Services.  You will be asked in each
    case whether you want to connect a third-party email or reward account. You may manage your connections to email
    and reward accounts and disconnect at any time in the settings menu and Point Tracker menu, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Third-Party Social Sign-Ins</h3>
<p>
    You can sign in to our TripIt Services using third-party social sign-ins
    (e.g., Google, Facebook, and Yahoo). These social sign-in providers will share certain Personal Data with us as
    described in their sign-in notices or in their privacy policies, which might include information such as your name,
    profile picture, age range, gender, and other public information.  We encourage you to review prior to signing in
    through the applicable service.
</p>

<h3 id="personal-data-collected-cookies">Cookies, Analytics, and Tracking</h3>
<p>
    When you use the TripIt Services through the Site, some information
    such as Internet protocol (IP) address, device or browser information, logs, or clickstream information is
    automatically collected about your usage and activity to address technical support issues and understand how you
    use the Site. TripIt may use certain tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, or third-party analytics
    tools to obtain such information.  You may find out more about the various tracking tools used on the Site and the
    choices you have by following the Cookie Preferences link on the Site footer. Our App utilizes tracking
    technologies from third-party service providers we have engaged to provide services on our behalf. In some cases,
    these are analytics providers that provide services such as application analytics and crash reporting. In other
    cases, these are advertising or campaign measurement providers. These providers may also automatically collect
    some of the information described above, including, for example, usage information, IP address, access times,
    browser type and language, device type, device identifiers, and Wi-Fi information. These providers may also
    automatically collect the above information about you through the App and on other sites and services, including
    personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites, devices,
    online services, and applications when you use our App. Some third parties help us and others associate your
    activities across the browsers and devices you use, or that your household uses, for retargeting, cross-device
    advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes. The third-party analytics and advertising providers we use
    include:
    <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;gl=us">Google Analytics</a>,
    <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf">Crashlytics</a>, and
    <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://apsalar.com/privacy-policy/">Apsalar</a>.
    Some third-party providers allow you choices about their collection or use of your information. Some of these
    providers may also be members of the
    <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</a>    or
    <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</a>,
    which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.
</p>

<h3>Contacts</h3>
<p>
    From the Site, you can access and import contacts from your other online address books, like
    Google, Yahoo, and Outlook.  If you would like us to invite another individual to join the TripIt Services, you may
    provide us their email address so that we may send them an invitation on your behalf to visit the TripIt Services.
    When using the App, the App may also access your device contacts if you enable those permissions.
</p>

<h3>Location Data</h3>
<p>
    Certain features of the TripIt Services may collect precise geolocation data, including
    through GPS (global positioning systems), IP address, and other location-based technologies.  Additional
    information about these features is provided <a href="#choices-location-data">below</a>, along with the
    settings screens for the features in the App.
</p>

<h2>Choices You Have Regarding Personal Data</h2>

<h3>Profile and Transaction Information</h3>
<p>
    Through the profile and settings pages within the Site and the App,
    you can update profile information associated with your account at any time, such as contact and payment
    information, travel preferences, privacy and sharing settings, and alerts and connected applications.  Depending
    upon the type of access you grant to third parties, such as third-party applications that you have granted access
    to your account or team members that you’ve allowed to manage your itineraries, they may also be permitted to edit
    the information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such information. You may change
    who has access to your information by changing your publishing options in your account settings. You may choose to
    display certain information you give us in your public profile. Our Site may offer publicly accessible blogs or
    community forums. You should be aware that any information you choose to share in these areas may be read,
    collected, and used by others.
</p>
<p>
    If you otherwise wish to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any of your information held by us, or a
    change in the way we use your information, please contact us at:
    <a href="mailto:privacy-request@concur.com">privacy-request@concur.com</a>. We reserve the right  to charge you a
    fee, as permitted by applicable law, and may decline requests that are unreasonable, prohibited by law, or are not
    required to be honored by applicable law.
</p>

<h3 id="choices-location-data">Location Data</h3>
<p>
    The TripIt Services provide features that require your precise location and the use of
    location services on your mobile device through the App. Some of these features may be available only to users of
    the premium “Pro” version of the TripIt Services. You may enable or disable these TripIt Services within the App
    and the privacy settings in your mobile device.  Features such as Go Now (alerts you about important events, such
    as when you should leave for your drive to the airport based on your current location, flight status, and real-time
    traffic conditions) and Terminal and Gate Reminders (alerts you to your terminal and gate number when you’re close
    to the airport) require that location services on your mobile device be set to always provide location information,
    but these features only begin to detect your location a few hours prior to your scheduled departure and do not
    continuously collect your location.  The TripIt Services may also provide you with navigation services within
    certain airports or between destinations based on your itinerary or destinations that you have specified.
    These services require that location services on your mobile device be enabled only when you are using the App.
</p>

<h3>SAP Concur Account</h3>
<p>
    If your company subscribes to certain business travel and expense solutions from
    Concur Technologies, Inc. or Concur Holdings (Netherlands) B.V. (“SAP Concur”), you may connect or disconnect your
    SAP Concur Account from your TripIt account within the TripIt Services or from your SAP Concur Account.  Once
    connected, any itineraries or travel information within the TripIt Services may be available to your company.
    This may include your personal itineraries within the TripIt Services unless you exclude them using the
    “Link to Concur” setting or delete them from your SAP Concur Account.  If you choose to disconnect your TripIt
    Services account from your SAP Concur account, or you no longer have access to your SAP Concur Account, any
    Personal Data shared with your company prior to such time is governed by the terms between your company and SAP
    Concur or one of its corporate affiliates, and you will need to contact your company regarding use and retention
    of that data.  If you intend to continue to use your TripIt Services account after you no longer have access to
    your SAP Concur Account, you will need to update your TripIt Services account email to a personal email account.
</p>

<h3>Connections with Other Services</h3>
<p>
    Other third-party services you have chosen to connect with the TripIt
    Services may be enabled or disabled through selections in the Site or the App.  You usually can also enable or
    disable connections through the third-party services themselves.  Certain third-party services we may feature
    through our TripIt Services give you social-media options to interact with buttons or widgets that let you “like”
    information or post information about your activities publicly from the TripIt Services to third-party sites and
    platforms or privately within your network.  By connecting your TripIt Services account with third-party services,
    you enable third-party services to access the TripIt Services API and gain access to your itinerary information, as
    well as your profile information.  Their use of this information is governed by their user terms with you and their
    privacy policies.
</p>

<h3>Email and Marketing Choices</h3>
<p>
    You can manage your email preferences through the selections within the Site
    or the App by updating your email subscription settings. You can also unsubscribe from promotional emails by:
    (1) following the unsubscribe instructions in our emails; or (2) emailing us at
    <a href="mailto:privacy-request@concur.com">privacy-request@concur.com</a>. You may update your email preferences
    from time to time. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from promotional email messages, we may still need to
    contact you with important transactional information related to your account and your use of the Service. For
    example, even if you have unsubscribed from our email messages, we will still send you emails relating to security,
    billing, or account services such as password reset.
</p>

<h3>Push and Text Message Alerts</h3>
<p>
    You may manage the push message alerts regarding flight delays, gate
    changes, and other alert information specific to your itinerary sent by the TripIt Services to your mobile device
    through the settings page in the Site or within the App.  Similarly, you may manage text message alerts through
    the settings page in the Site or within the App, and you may always opt out of text message alerts by replying
    STOP to any text message sent by TripIt.
</p>

<h3>Connections, Groups, and Sharing Your Travel Information</h3>
<p>
    The TripIt Services enable you to keep in
    touch with your contacts and other members of the TripIt Services when you travel, such as by importing your
    contacts as described above.  You may also invite other TripIt Services users to become connections in your
    personal network within the TripIt Service or search for and join groups of TripIt Services users so that you can
    more easily coordinate travel and share travel information. In your settings menu, you may configure certain
    privacy controls that enable the sharing of profile information, traveler information, and itinerary information
    and statistics with other users or with the general public (including external search engines). You can share
    specific itineraries with both TripIt Services users and non-users.  If we send an email itinerary on your behalf
    to a non-user, you represent that you have permission to direct us to email such person.
</p>

<h3>Cookies, Analytics, and Tracking</h3>
<p>
    You also have choices regarding some of the technologies used to track
    your use of the TripIt Services.  You may find out more about the various tracking tools used on the Site and the
    choices you have by following the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the Site. Note that the settings are
    limited to the particular browser installed on a particular device.  So if you use TripIt Services with different
    browsers or different devices, including a mobile device, you may have to disable the tracking cookies in the
    browsers of all relevant devices. It may not always be possible to disable cookies in the App, and disabling
    cookies on the Site will not disable tracking technologies on the App. We may not recognize or respond to every
    type of "do not track" signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding
    the collection of Personal Data about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party
    websites or online services, but we give you certain choices about how we collect Personal Data as described in
    this Policy.  For more information on how we collect Personal Data for these purposes, see the “Cookies, Analytics
    and Tracking” section <a href="#personal-data-collected-cookies">above</a>.
</p>

<h2>How TripIt Shares Personal Data</h2>

<p>The TripIt Services may share your Personal Data as described in this Policy and as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        With your consent.</li>
    <li>
        Between SAP Concur, its corporate affiliates, and your company, if you connect your TripIt Services account
        with your SAP Concur Account, if applicable.
    </li>
    <li>
        With third parties to the extent that you have enabled a connection between your TripIt Services account and
        a third-party service.
    </li>
    <li>
        With other TripIt users or the public through your public profile in accordance with your privacy settings,
        if you share itineraries, and if you grant another TripIt user access to manage or view your travel plans.
    </li>
    <li>
        When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected
        illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of TripIt, our users, or others;
        and in connection with the enforcement of our terms and contracts.
    </li>
    <li>
        In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, acquisition, consolidation, or
        asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. We may assign or transfer your information as part of
        the transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        With third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers that are working on our behalf and need
        access to your information to provide specific services to us as part of the TripIt Services, such as credit
        card processing companies, or hosting, email messaging, or SMS providers.
    </li>
    <li>
        In an aggregated form that does not directly identify you.
    </li>
    <li>
        As required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with
        a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served to us.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How Personal Data May Be Transferred to the United States</h2>

<p>
    The TripIt Services operate from data centers in multiple locations globally, including in the United States.
    Using the TripIt Services may result in the transfer, use, processing, or storage of Personal Data in the United
    States or any other country where TripIt operates or maintains facilities or service centers, including
    jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide protections equivalent to those provided in your
    home country. TripIt takes steps designed to ensure that the Personal Data is processed according to applicable
    law wherever the data is located and the provisions of our agreements, including any intercompany data-processing
    agreements among corporate affiliates.
</p>
<p>
    By providing your information to us through your use of the TripIt Services, you agree to that transfer, storage,
    and processing of your Personal Data in the United States.
</p>

<h2>Rights for Certain Users</h2>

<p>
    TripIt adheres to applicable data protection laws in the European Economic Area (EEA), which, if applicable to you,
    include the following rights:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Where processing of Personal Data is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any
        time for future processing.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have a right to request access to, rectification, or erasure of your Personal Data, or to transfer
        or receive a copy of your Personal Data in a usable format.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have a right to object to the processing of your Personal Data under certain circumstances.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have a right to lodge a complaint with an applicable data protection authority.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Concur Technologies, Inc. is the controller of your Personal Data for the TripIt Services, and Concur (Netherlands)
    B.V., an affiliate of Concur Technologies, Inc., located at Barbara Strozzilaan, 101 1083 HN, Amsterdam, The
    Netherlands, is our data protection representative for the EEA and Switzerland, which you may contact at
    <a href="mailto:privacy-request@concur.com">privacy-request@concur.com</a>. The data protection officer for SAP
    group companies is Mathias Cellarius (<a href="mailto:privacy@sap.com">privacy@sap.com</a>).
</p>
<p>
    If applicable under French law, you can also send us specific instructions regarding the use of your personal
    information after your death by contacting us at
    <a href="mailto:privacy-request@concur.com">privacy-request@concur.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The services hereunder are not intended for use by the citizens of the Russian Federation who reside in Russia.
    If you are a Russian citizen residing in Russia, you are hereby notified that any Personal Data that you input
    into the services will be solely at your own risk and responsibility.  You explicitly agree that we may accumulate
    your Personal Data and will process this data in the United States and in other countries, and that you will not
    hold TripIt accountable for any potential nonobservance of the Russian Federation legislation.
</p>

<h2>Security and Retention of Personal Data</h2>

<p>
    We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to promote the integrity and
    confidentiality of the personally identifiable information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method
    of electronic storage is completely secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable
    means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<p>
    We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the TripIt Services and for other essential
    purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
    Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention
    periods can vary significantly. The criteria used to determine retention include (1) the length of time Personal
    Data is needed to provide the applicable services (such as maintaining and improving the performance of the TripIt
    Services, enabling system security measures, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records);
    (2) if users have provided, created, or maintained Personal Data with the expectation that we will retain it
    until they affirmatively remove it (in which case we may maintain the data until actively deleted by the user);
    (3) whether the Personal Data is of a sensitive type (a shortened retention time may be appropriate); and
    (4) whether we are subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data (such as mandatory
    data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data, or data that must be
    retained for the purposes of litigation).
</p>

<h2>Updates and Questions</h2>

<p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time without notice to you other than posting the revised policy on the
    TripIt Services or by providing such notice about or obtaining consent to changes as may be required by applicable
    law. If we change our Policy, we will post those changes to this Policy and change the effective date above.
    We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
