            <p>Southern Cross Austereo Pty Ltd (ACN 109 243 110) (<strong>SCA</strong>) and our related bodies corporate operate a number of commercial radio stations, television stations, websites, and other media platforms throughout Australia, including PodcastOne Australia. In the course of conducting our business we may collect and handle your personal information.</p>
<p>We are committed to the protection of your personal information and meeting the standards set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (<strong>the Act</strong>), including the Australian Privacy Principles (<strong>APPs</strong>). This Privacy Policy sets out how we will handle the personal information that we collect and hold.</p>
<h3><strong>Collection of Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What is personal information?</strong></p>
<p><em>Personal information</em> means any information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether that information is true or not and whether it is recorded in a material form or not.</p>
<p><em>Sensitive information</em> is a subset of personal information that includes information about your race or ethnic origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity or orientation. We generally do not ask for sensitive information, but may do so where it is reasonably necessary for our functions and activities and it is permitted or required by law. Generally we will only collect sensitive information where you have consented to our collecting that information, including where you voluntarily submit such information to us.</p>
<p><strong>What personal Information we collect and hold</strong></p>
<p>The personal information we collect about you will depend on the nature of our relationship with you. We may collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>your name, address, email, phone number(s) and emergency contact details;</li>
<li>your age, date of birth, gender;</li>
<li>payment, credit card and/or bank account details;</li>
<li>photographs, film and/or audio recordings of you where you attend an SCA affiliated event, attend our premises, call one of our radio or TV stations, or otherwise participate on-air; and</li>
<li>your interests, opinions about our brands and services, or other information relevant to promotions and activities that SCA runs and to your engagement with SCA, such as information contained in competition entries, job applications, on-air interactions, complaints and enquiries.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also conduct research surveys for third parties. Where you participate in these surveys we may also collect information about your occupation and salary, your opinions about the brands and services of third parties, as well as sensitive information such as your political opinions or health information. We will only collect your personal information as part of a research survey with your prior consent.</p>
<p><strong>Why we collect personal information</strong></p>

<p>We also collect personal information for research and marketing purposes and to provide you with information about events, products and services (both our own and those of other companies that may be of interest to you), to improve the services we provide, to run various competitions and trade promotions, and to provide you with payment receipts.</p>
<p>Where lawful and practical, you may deal with us anonymously or use a pseudonym. However in some instances, because of the products and services we provide, if you do not provide us with your personal information we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service (for example, if we require your details in connection with a competition we are running, we cannot provide you with a prize should you be a prize winner and we cannot contact you).</p>
<p><strong>How we collect Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We collect personal information directly from you when you interact with us, for example when:</p>
<ul>
<li>you submit an entry into a competition or trade promotion;</li>
<li>you participate in listener loyalty programs;</li>
<li>you subscribe to a member database or email newsletter;</li>
<li>you send us an email, contact us through any of our websites, or post on any of our websites (including any of our social media pages);</li>
<li>you purchase products or services from us;</li>
<li>you participate in a research survey;</li>
<li>you download one of our mobile Apps or stream our products from a website or via a mobile App;</li>
<li>you call us; or</li>
<li>you attend an event or activity that we organise, sponsor, or are otherwise affiliated with.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have CCTV cameras operating in many of our premises to ensure security and a good working environment for our staff. Premises where CCTV cameras operate have signs at the point of entry, informing you of their operation.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may obtain personal information about you from third parties such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>marketing databases or other sources that are publicly available such as websites, journals, legal directories and phone books;</li>
<li>friends or relatives who have provided us with your details as part of a promotion, competition or event, including where they have nominated you as an emergency contact; and</li>
<li>referees or previous employers where you have applied for a job with SCA.</li>
</ul>
