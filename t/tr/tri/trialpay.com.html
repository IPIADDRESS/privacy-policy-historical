                      <p><strong><a name="1" id="1"></a>What This Privacy  Policy Covers</strong><br>
                        This policy covers how TrialPay treats personal information  that we collect and receive. Personal information is information about you that  is personally identifiable like your name or email address and that is not  otherwise publicly available.</p>
                      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services  and websites offered by TrialPay Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated  companies (collectively, “TrialPay’s services”). In this Privacy Policy,  references to “we,” “our” and “us” refer to TrialPay while “you” and “your” refer  to the TrialPay customer or user. This policy does not apply to the practices  of companies that TrialPay does not own or control or to people that TrialPay  does not employ or manage.</p>
                      <p><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Information We Collect </strong><br>
                        We collect personal information when you register with TrialPay  or when you use our products or services. We may combine information about you  that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other  companies. </p>
                      <p>When you register we ask for information such as your name  and email address. For some products and services we may also ask for your  address so that we can ensure delivery of physical products. </p>
                      <p>TrialPay automatically receives and records information on  our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, TrialPay cookie  information, and the page you request. </p>
                      <p><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>How We Use Collected  Information </strong><br>
                        TrialPay uses information for the following general  purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our  services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for  internal and external clients. </p>
                      <p><strong>Children</strong><br>
                        This site is not aimed to attract children and its objective  is not to collect personal information from children. Anyone under the age of  18 should not use this site unless supervised by an adult. TrialPay’s  goal is to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to collection  and use of information from children, including the Children’s On-line Privacy  Protection Act of the United    States.</p>

                        TrialPay does not rent, sell, or share personal information  about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide  products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under  the following circumstances: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>We provide the information to trusted partners  who work on behalf of or with TrialPay under confidentiality agreements.

However, these  companies do not have any independent right to share this information. </li>
                        <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal  process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal  claims; </li>
                        <li>We believe it is necessary to share information  in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety  of any person, violations of TrialPay's terms of use, or as otherwise required  by law. </li>
                        <li>We transfer information about you if TrialPay is  acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, TrialPay will notify  you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a  different privacy policy. </li>

                      <p>TrialPay displays targeted offers based on personal  information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or  click on targeted offers meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages  18-24 from a particular geographic area. </p>

                        <li>TrialPay does not provide any personal information  to the advertiser when you interact with or complete a targeted offer. However,  by interacting with or viewing an offer you are consenting to the possibility  that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting  criteria used to display the ad. </li>
