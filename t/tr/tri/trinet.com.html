We,  TriNet, will never sell, rent, lend or trade this information in our possession  to any other company for the purpose of contacting you regarding commercial  services. If you are a TriNet customer or worksite employee of a customer, we  collect the information necessary to provide our services, collecting it either  from you directly or from your worksite employer. This collection is limited to  the purpose of providing the service for which the customer has engaged TriNet.  By voluntarily providing information or by accessing our websites, you consent  to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable  information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, the  International Policy.</p>
          <p> When you download  and/or use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of  device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or  "UDID"). We do not ask for, access or track any location-based  information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our  mobile apps or services.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Usage  Tracking and Cookies</strong></h2>
          <p>We  track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites, but this tracking is  never associated with non-registered individual users. We compile aggregate  data mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information may  include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or  not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), and  what browser and computing platform you are using.</p>
          <p> In addition, we use cookies  on certain pages of our sites. We may also offer certain features that are only  available through the use of a cookie. Cookies enable you to enter your  password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide you  information that is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard  drive, not on our sites. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning  they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. We also use persistent  cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period  of time and remembers your preferences. You are always free to decline our  cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to  use certain features on our sites, and you may be required to reenter your  password more frequently during a session.</p>
          <p> The use of cookies by  our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers is  not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these  cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service  providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our  site.</p>
          <p> As is true of most web  sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,  internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,  date/time stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>            We use this  information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to  administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather  demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this  automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>            If you send us proposals  or personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or  third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our  sites, we may collect and store such information in a file specific to you. If  you submit questions via our sites, we may post your questions on the sites,  and reprint them in various articles and customer communications. We will never  include the name, contact or other identifiable information of people who  submit questions, regardless of which channel we use to distribute content.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Use of  Information </strong></h2>
          <p>            We  use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and  promotional efforts, statistically analyze site usage, improve our content  product offerings, customize our sites' content, layout and services, and  provide our services (if applicable).</p>
          <p> We may use the email  address, mailing address, and phone number we collect from you to respond to  your inquiries and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to contact you  regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications  relevant to your use of our sites. In some cases, we may use your personally  identifiable information to inform you of new services, promotions and other  matters targeted to your interests. You may choose to stop receiving our  newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions  included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account  settings page or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:employees@trinet.com" target="_new" title="Contact us to find out more info on payroll services &amp; other human resources services we offer">employees@trinet.com</a>.</p>
          <p> We use information in  the file we maintain specific to you, and other information we obtain from your  current and past activities on our sites, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot  problems. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or  resolve disputes and we may evaluate information about you to look for users  using multiple User IDs or aliases.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Customers  and Worksite Employees of TriNet </strong></h2>
          <p>            If  you are a customer (also referred to as a worksite employer) or worksite  employee serviced by TriNet, we may collect and maintain personally  identifiable information including, but not limited to, name, address, phone  number, social security number, taxpayer identification number, age, marital  status, occupation, salary, benefits, dependent information, etc. through TriNet  service websites or other means disclosed to you. This information will be used  to provide our professional employer and other HR-related services, which may  include sharing such information with your worksite employer to the extent  permitted by applicable law.</p>
          <p> Once  you receive a username and password, you can review and change the information  you submitted during registration. If your registration information changes,  you must promptly update, change or delete your registration information by  logging into your information page or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:employees@trinet.com" target="_new" title="Contact us to find out more info on payroll services &amp; other human resources services we offer">employees@trinet.com</a>. We will respond to  your inquiries about your personal information within 30 days. We will retain  in our files information you have requested be removed in some circumstances,  such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce any applicable  agreements. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from  our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our  systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally  identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in  response to your requests.</p>
          <h2><strong>Disclosure  of Information</strong></h2>
          <p>            Unfortunately,  due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your  private communications and other personally identifiable information will never  be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this policy. By way of example  (without limiting the foregoing): we may be forced to disclose information to  the government or third parties under certain circumstances, such as to comply  with a subpoena or similar legal process; we may use information when we  believe in good faith that it is necessary to protect our rights, protect your  safety or the safety of others; and we may respond to any other third party  requests with your prior consent to do so. </p>
          <p> Third parties may  unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  Therefore, although we employ industry-standard practices to protect your  privacy, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%  secure. As a result, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your  personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain  private.</p>
          <p> As a general  proposition, we do not sell, rent, lend or trade any personally identifiable  information about you to any third party. The following paragraphs describe  some of the ways that personally identifiable information about you may be disclosed  to third parties.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Legal  Requests</strong></h2>
          <p>            We  cooperate with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws,  intellectual property rights and other rights. Therefore, local, state,  federal, territorial, provincial and international law enforcement can request  and may receive your personally identifiable information. By your use of the  TriNet.com website, TriNet’s service websites, or TriNet's services (as  applicable), you hereby accept these terms and you authorize us to disclose any  information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we,  in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an  investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity  that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Business  Transactions</strong></h2>
          <p>We  reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information as part of a  sale or transfer of all or a relevant portion of our business or assets. Any  such sale would be subject to appropriate privacy protections for you. You will  be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in  ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any  choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Suppliers  and Other Service Providers</strong></h2>
          <p>            We may use third-party suppliers and service providers to  facilitate provision of our professional employer and HR-related services. For  example, we may outsource the operations of one or more aspects of our sites to  a supplier or service provider who performs services according to our  requirements. In all cases, we restrict how these suppliers and other service  providers may access, use and disclose information received from our websites.  We do not permit these suppliers and other service providers to access  information about you, other than that information necessary for them to  complete the services for which they are contracted. Under no circumstances do  we allow them to disclose, sell, rent, lend, trade or in any other way transmit  data about you to third parties, and we use contractual means to require them  to provide appropriate protection for your personally identifiable information  and to use it only for the services for which they are contracted.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Retention of Information</strong></h2>
          <p>            We  retain personally identifiable information that we collect only so long as  reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to  meet legal requirements. In certain cases, information is required to be  retained indefinitely. We have a Business Record Retention Policy and an E-mail  Retention Policy which provide for the destruction of personally identifiable  information after it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was  collected and legal requirements have been met.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Security</strong></h2>
          <p>We  use industry standard methods, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers  (SSL), to safeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable information  about you. Using SSL means that data such as names and passwords cannot be  easily deciphered by outside users. However, "perfect security" does  not exist on the Internet.</p>
          <h2> <strong>Referrals</strong></h2>
          <p>            If  you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we  will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. You must have the  consent of your friend to provide us with this information. We will  automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit  the website.

        <p><strong>This  Privacy Policy applies only to Personal Information transferred to TriNet Group  Inc., and its subsidiaries ("TriNet") from locations in the European  Union ("EU"), Switzerland, Canada and other locations outside of the  United States. In addition, all other personal information transferred to  TriNet is subject to TriNet's "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use"  posted on <a href="http://www.trinet.com/">www.trinet.com</a>, <a href="http://www.hrpassport.com/">www.hrpassport.com</a>, <a href="https://soiportal.soi.com">https://soiportal.soi.com</a>, <a href="http://www.hrdatasystems.com">www.hrdatasystems.com</a>, and <a href="https://access.accordhr.com/login/">https://access.accordhr.com/login/</a>.

        <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
        <p>          TriNet  delivers HR outsourcing services that allow companies to do what they do best.  Thousands of employers have turned to TriNet for human resources, benefits,  payroll, workers' compensation and strategic human capital services. As their  trusted HR advisor, TriNet helps these employers contain HR costs, minimize  employer-related risk and relieve the administrative burden of HR. TriNet's  suite of HR outsourcing services includes coordination of services to its  customers’ locations and worksite employees outside of the United States. In order  for TriNet to provide this vast array of services, TriNet must collect certain  personal information regarding the worksite employees of its customers.</p>
        <p> Protecting customer  and employee privacy is important to TriNet. TriNet adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreements  concerning the transfer of personal data from locations in the European Union  (EU) and Switzerland to the United States and adheres to Canada’s Personal  Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA") and  the applicable provincial privacy legislation.</p>
        <p>          TriNet complies with  the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.–Swiss Safe Harbor framework as  set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and  retention of personal data from European Union member countries and  Switzerland. TriNet has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy  Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity,  access, and enforcement (“Principles”). To learn more about the Safe Harbor  program, and to view TriNet’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
        <p> This Privacy Policy  applies to all Personal Information received by TriNet from outside of the  United States whether in electronic, paper or verbal format. All such  information is transmitted to the United States and is maintained in San  Leandro, California; Reno, Nevada; Bradenton, Florida; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;  Fort Mill, South Carolina; and New York City, New York, which may have privacy  and data protection laws that differ from those in the country in which an  employee resides. As a result, Personal Information may be subject to access  requests from U.S. government agencies, courts and law enforcement officials in  accordance with U.S. laws.</p>
        <h2> <strong>Definition  of Personal Information</strong></h2>
        <p>"Personal  Information" or "Information" means information that 1) is  transferred from outside of the United States to TriNet; 2) is recorded in any  form; 3) is about or pertains to a specific individual; and 4) can be linked to  that individual. Accordingly, this policy applies to you if information linked  to you is transferred to TriNet in any recorded form from outside the United  States.</p>
        <h2> <strong>Safe  Harbor Principles</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Notice:</strong> We, TriNet, will  inform you of the purpose for which we collect and use the Personal Information  and the types of non-agent third parties to which we disclose or may disclose  that Personal Information. We will provide you with the choice and means to  limit our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for a purpose other  than that for which it was originally collected.</p>
        <p> Personal Information  includes, but is not limited to: name, employer, title, position held, length  of employment, documents that verify employment, work address, work phone  number, home address, home phone number, country of domicile, copy of  government identity card, copy of passport, date of birth, gender, marital  status, family status, compensation, salary information, tax information, names  and birthdates of dependents and bank information. This Personal Information is  transmitted to payroll and benefit providers and other vendors that participate  in providing customers’ payroll, benefits and other related services.</p>
        <p> <strong>Choice: </strong>We will offer you the  opportunity to choose (opt out) whether your Personal Information is 1) to be  disclosed to a third party (other than a vendor or service provider we have  contracted with in connection with providing payroll, benefits and other  related services) or 2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for  which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will  obtain express consent when required by applicable law.</p>
        <p> <strong>Onward Transfers:</strong> Prior to disclosing  Personal Information to a third party (other than the service providers  referred to above), we will notify you of such disclosure and allow you a  choice (opt out) regarding such disclosure. We will ensure that any third party  to which Personal Information may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or  is subject to law providing the same level of privacy protection as is required  by the Principles or agrees in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy  protection.</p>
        <p> <strong>Data Security:</strong> We will take  reasonable steps, proportionate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information,  to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,  disclosure, alteration or destruction. We have put in place appropriate  physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure Personal  Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or  destruction. However, we cannot guarantee the security of Information on, or  transmitted via, the Internet.</p>
        <p> <strong>Data Integrity:</strong> We will only process  and use Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for  the purposes for which it was collected or authorized by you, including the  purposes to provide payroll, benefits and related services. To the extent  necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure  that Personal Information is as accurate, complete, current and reliable as  necessary for its intended use. Personal Information may only be accessed by  persons within our organization or third-party suppliers and service providers  who require such access to provide you with the services indicated above.</p>
        <p> <strong>Access:</strong> We will allow you  access to your Personal Information and allow you to correct, amend or delete  inaccurate information, except, to the extent permitted by applicable law,  where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to  the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of  persons other than you would be violated. If access to Personal Information is  denied, we will provide you with the reason for such denial.</p>
        <p> <strong>Enforcement:</strong> We use a  self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Policy and  periodically verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the  information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely  implemented and accessible, and in conformity with the Principles. We encourage  interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided  and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes  regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the  Principles and this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2> <strong>Amendments</strong></h2>
        <p>          This  Privacy Policy was last updated on March 31, 2014, and may be amended from time  to time by the posting of a revised policy on this website. If we make any  material changes we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this  site prior to the change becoming effective.

        <h2> <strong>Use of  Service Websites</strong></h2>
        <p>TriNet’s service websites are licensed to you subject to the terms and  conditions set forth here and in any acknowledgment for a specific service  website. You agree that all information submitted by you to a TriNet service  website is and will be true and correct. You agree that the service website you  access constitutes confidential, proprietary, intellectual property of TriNet,  that this license is revocable by TriNet at any time, and that you will not  modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or otherwise tamper with  the service website or create any derivative works or otherwise incorporate the  service website in other programs, without TriNet’s prior written consent. Any  feedback you provide will become TriNet information and TriNet will have the  royalty-free right to share the feedback and to create and use derivative works  based on the feedback. </p>
        <h2><strong>As Is</strong></h2>
        <p>Your licensed usage of TriNet’s service websites is  on an “As Is” basis and TriNet disclaims any and all warranties, express or  implied, to the full extent permitted by law.

TriNet cannot be held  liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, consequential, or other special  damages arising out of your use of TriNet’s service websites or online  services.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2><strong>Control  of Your Login Password—for Customers and Worksite Employees Only</strong></h2>
        <p>Except as specifically  permitted by this section, you may not disclose your password to access  TriNet’s service websites to any third party or share it with any third party.

        <h2><strong>TriNet  Benefit Plans Disclaimer</strong></h2>
        <p>TriNet  is not an insurance company and nothing contained herein constitutes an offer  to sell, buy, or procure insurance. We are the single employer sponsor of all  our benefit plans. We make these plans available to qualifying worksite  employees with whom we have established an employment relationship and who  perform services for our customers in a Professional Employer Organization  ("PEO") service model. Under this model, we incur all expenses  associated with our plan sponsorship and maintenance and we bill the customer  for our services.</p>
        <p> Other than compliance  with TriNet’s contract terms, customers have no other financial obligation to  us, our other customers, worksite employees or any of our insurance carriers  for benefit plans sponsorship or provision. Our carriers have recourse against  TriNet and not against our customers for premiums and expenses associated with  plan sponsorship.</p>
        <p>Any references to  "your benefit programs or plans" are not legal terms or terms of art  and should not be confused with legal plan sponsorship, participation or fiduciary  compliance. These terms and others, such as "your employees" or  "your selections, plan, or investments," are used solely as lay terms  of convenience so that you understand we are referring only to the decisions  made and TriNet plans available in a specific worksite or to a specific group  of worksite employees.</p>
        <p>Insurance coverage  exclusions and limitations apply. In the event there is a conflict between any  of the information contained in any benefits guidance materials we provide  (including but not limited to information contained in any TriNet website, the  Benefits Confirmation Statement, any written or electronic pamphlets, letters,  emails, text messages and statements made by TriNet employees) and TriNet's  Plan document, the Plan document will control. Also, if there is a conflict  between an official certificate provided by our insurance carrier(s) (the  "Carrier Certificate") and either TriNet's Plan document, any TriNet  Summary Plan Description, statements made by a TriNet employee or any other  benefits guidance materials provided by TriNet (including but not limited to  those described above), the Carrier Certificate will control.</p>
        <h2><strong>Changes and Applicable Law</strong></h2>
        <p>The information on TriNet’s websites may have  general applicability to TriNet customers and worksite employees and is not  deemed to amend, alter or supersede specific contracts or agreements. TriNet  reserves the right to change the terms of use and privacy policies contained  herein at any time and such charges will become effective after TriNet posts  the changes on this website. Any dispute regarding the terms of use will be  resolved by arbitration conducted in the city of the TriNet office closest to  your most recent work location. The arbitration will be in accordance with the  rules and processes of either the American Arbitration Association or Judicial  Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., and, for state law, the law of  Delaware will apply.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
