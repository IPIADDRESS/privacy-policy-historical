<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The TriNet.com  website collects contact and other identifying information. We, TriNet, will  never sell, rent, lend or trade this information in our possession to any other  company for the purpose of contacting you regarding commercial services. If you  are a TriNet customer or worksite employee of a customer, we collect the  information necessary to provide our services, collecting it either from you  directly or from your worksite employer. This collection is limited to the  purpose of providing the service for which the customer has engaged TriNet. By  voluntarily providing information or by accessing our websites, you consent to  the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information  in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, the International  Policy.</p>
        <p>When you download and/or  use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device  you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or  "UDID"). We do not ask for, access or track any location-based  information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile  apps or services.</p>
        <h2>Usage Tracking and Cookies</h2>
        <p>We track user traffic  patterns throughout all of our sites, but this tracking is never associated  with non-registered individual users. We compile aggregate data mainly by  tallying page views throughout our sites. This information may include the URL  that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you  go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), and what browser and  computing platform you are using.</p>
        <p>In addition, we use  cookies on certain pages of our sites. We may also offer certain features that  are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies enable you to enter  your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide  you information that is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your  hard drive, not on our sites. Most cookies are "session cookies,"  meaning they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. We also use  persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an  extended period of time and remembers your preferences. You are always free  to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may  not be able to use certain features on our sites, and you may be required to  reenter your password more frequently during a session.</p>
        <p>The use of cookies by our partners,  affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers is not covered by  our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our  partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers use  session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>
        <p>As is true of most web sites, we  gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information  includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service  provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and  clickstream data.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>We use this information, which does  not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to  track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information  about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected  data to personally identifiable information.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>If you send us personal  correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties  send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our sites, we may  collect and store such information in a file specific to you. If you submit  questions via our sites, we may post your questions on the sites, and reprint  them in various articles and customer communications. We will never include the  name, contact or other identifiable information of people who submit questions,  regardless of which channel we use to distribute content.</p>
<h2>Use of Information </h2>
        <p>We use personally  identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional  efforts, statistically analyze site usage, improve our content product  offerings, customize our sites' content, layout and services, and provide our  services (if applicable).</p>
        <p>We may use the email  address, mailing address, and phone number we collect from you to respond to  your inquiries and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to contact you  regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications  relevant to your use of our sites. In some cases, we may use your personally  identifiable information to inform you of new services, promotions and other  matters targeted to your interests. You may choose to stop receiving our  newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions  included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account  settings page or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:employees@trinet.com" target="_new" title="Contact us to find out more info on payroll services &amp; other human resources services we offer">employees@trinet.com</a>.</p>
        <p>We use information in  the file we maintain specific to you, and other information we obtain from your  current and past activities on our sites, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot  problems. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or  resolve disputes and we may evaluate information about you to look for users  using multiple User IDs or aliases.</p>
<h2>Customers and Worksite Employees of TriNet </h2>
        <p>If you are a customer (also referred to as a worksite employer) or  worksite employee serviced by TriNet, we may collect and maintain personally  identifiable information including, but not limited to, name, address, phone  number, social security number, taxpayer identification number, age, marital  status, occupation, salary, benefits, dependent information, etc. through HR  Passport® or other means disclosed to you. This information will be used to  provide our professional employer and other HR-related services, which may  include sharing such information with your worksite employer to the extent  permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Information </h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, due to  the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private  communications and other personally identifiable information will never be  disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this policy. By way of example  (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to  the government or third parties under certain circumstances, such as to comply  with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that  disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety  of others, respond to a government request, or respond to any other third party  request with your prior consent to do so. </p>
        <p>Third parties may  unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  Therefore, although we employ industry-standard practices to protect your  privacy, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%  secure. As a result, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your  personally identifiable information or private communications will always  remain private.</p>
        <p>As a general  proposition, we do not sell, rent, lend or trade any personally identifiable  information about you to any third party. The following paragraphs describe  some of the ways that personally identifiable information about you may be  disclosed to third parties.</p>
        <h2>Legal Requests </h2>
        <p>We cooperate with law  enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property  rights and other rights. Therefore, local, state, federal, territorial,  provincial and international law enforcement can request and may receive your  personally identifiable information. By your use of the TriNet.com website, HR  Passport® or TriNet's services (as applicable), you hereby accept these terms  and you authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement  or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary  or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual  property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to  legal liability.</p>
        <h2>Business Transactions</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information as  part of a sale or transfer of all or a relevant portion of our business or  assets. Any such sale would be subject to appropriate privacy protections for  you. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of  any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as  well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable  information.</p>
<h2>Suppliers and Other Service Providers </h2>
        <p>We may use  third-party suppliers and service providers to facilitate provision of our  professional employer and HR-related services. For example, we may outsource  the operations of one or more aspects of our sites to a supplier or service  provider who performs services according to our requirements. In all cases, we  restrict how these suppliers and other service providers may access, use and  disclose information received from our sites. We do not permit these suppliers  and other service providers to access information about you, other than that  information necessary for them to complete the services for which they are  contracted. Under no circumstances do we allow them to disclose, sell, rent,  lend, trade or in any other way transmit data about you to third parties, and  we use contractual means to require them to provide appropriate protection for  your personally identifiable information and to use it only for the services  for which they are contracted.</p>
        <h2>Control of Your  HR Passport Login Password—for Customers and Worksite Employees Only</h2>
          <p>Except as  specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your password to  access HR Passport to any third party or share it with any third party. If you  lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over personally  identifiable information about you and may be subject to the consequences of  actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised  for any reason, you should immediately change your password and notify us that  you believe your password has been compromised. You may, however, disclose your  password to certain third parties with whom we have entered into specific  contractual and technical arrangements designed to safeguard your password ("Authorized  Password Users"), in order to enjoy the benefits of those third parties'  services in relation to our services.</p>

       <h2>Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information—for Customers and Worksite Employees Only</h2>
           <p>Once you receive a  username and password, you can review and change the information you submitted  during registration. If your registration information changes, you must  promptly update, change or delete your registration information by logging into  your information page or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:employees@trinet.com" target="_new" title="Contact us to find out more info on payroll services &amp; other human resources services we offer">employees@trinet.com</a>. We will respond to your  inquiries about your personal information within 30 days.  We will retain in our files information you have requested be removed in some  circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce  any applicable agreements. Further, such prior information is never completely  removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we  back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your  personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our  databases in response to your requests.</p>
           <h2>Retention of Information</h2>
           <p>We retain personally identifiable information that we collect only so  long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected  and to meet legal requirements. In certain cases, information is required to be  retained indefinitely. We have a Business Record Retention Policy and an E-mail  Retention Policy which provide for the destruction of personally identifiable  information after it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected  and legal requirements have been met.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
          <p>We use industry standard methods, such as firewalls  and Secure Socket Layers (SSL), to safeguard the confidentiality of personally  identifiable information about you. Using SSL means that data such as names and  passwords cannot be easily deciphered by outside users. However, "perfect  security" does not exist on the Internet.</p>
          <h2>Referrals</h2>
          <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.

<h2>TriNet Benefit Plans Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>TriNet is not an insurance company and nothing contained  herein constitutes an offer to sell, buy, or procure insurance. We are the  single employer sponsor of all our benefit plans. We make these plans available  to qualifying worksite employees with whom we have established an employment  relationship and who perform services for our customers in a Professional  Employer Organization ("PEO") service model. Under this model, we  incur all expenses associated with our plan sponsorship and maintenance and we  bill the customer for our services.</p>
          <p>Other than compliance with TriNet’s contract terms,  customers have no other financial obligation to us, our other customers,  worksite employees or any of our insurance carriers for benefit plans  sponsorship or provision. Our carriers have recourse against TriNet and not against  our customers for premiums and expenses associated with plan sponsorship.</p>
          <p>Any references to "your benefit programs or  plans" are not legal terms or terms of art and should not be confused with  legal plan sponsorship, participation or fiduciary compliance. These terms and  others, such as "your employees" or "your selections, plan, or  investments," are used solely as lay terms of convenience so that you  understand we are referring only to the decisions made and TriNet plans available  in a specific worksite or to a specific group of worksite employees.</p>
          <p>Insurance coverage exclusions and limitations apply. In  the event there is a conflict between any of the information contained in any  benefits guidance materials we provide (including but not limited to information  contained in any TriNet website, the Benefits Confirmation Statement, any  written or electronic pamphlets, letters, emails, text messages and statements  made by TriNet employees) and TriNet's Plan document, the Plan document will  control. Also, if there is a conflict between an official certificate provided  by our insurance carrier(s) (the "Carrier Certificate") and either  TriNet's Plan document, any TriNet Summary Plan Description, statements made by  a TriNet employee or any other benefits guidance materials provided by TriNet  (including but not limited to those described above), the Carrier Certificate  will control.</p>

        <p><strong>This Privacy Policy  applies only to Personal Information transferred to TriNet Group Inc., and its  subsidiaries ("TriNet") from locations in the European Union  ("EU"), Switzerland, Canada and other locations outside of the United  States. In addition, all other personal information transferred to TriNet is  subject to TriNet's "Terms of Use and Privacy Policy" posted on </strong><a href="http://www.trinet.com/"><strong>www.trinet.com</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="http://www.hrpassport.com/"><strong>www.hrpassport.com</strong></a><strong>.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>TriNet delivers HR  outsourcing services that allow companies to do what they do best. Thousands of  employers have turned to TriNet for human resources, benefits, payroll,  workers' compensation and strategic human capital services. As their trusted HR  advisor, TriNet helps these employers contain HR costs, minimize  employer-related risk and relieve the administrative burden of HR. TriNet's  suite of HR outsourcing services includes coordination of services to its  customers’ locations and worksite employees outside of the United States. In  order for TriNet to provide this vast array of services, TriNet must collect  certain personal information regarding the worksite employees of its customers.</p>
        <p>Protecting customer  and employee privacy is important to TriNet. TriNet adheres to the Safe Harbor  Agreements concerning the transfer of personal data from locations in the  European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States and adheres to  Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act  ("PIPEDA") and the applicable provincial privacy legislation. </p>
        <p>TriNet complies with  the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor  framework and the U.S.–Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set  forth by the U.S. Department of  Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from  European Union member countries and  Switzerland. TriNet has  certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice,  choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To  learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view TriNet’s certification,  please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy  applies to all Personal Information received by TriNet from outside of the  United States whether in electronic, paper or verbal format. All such  information is transmitted to the United States and is maintained in San  Leandro, California; Reno, Nevada; and Bradenton, Florida, which may have  privacy and data protection laws that differ from those in the country in which  an employee resides. As a result, Personal Information may be subject to access  requests from U.S. government agencies, courts and law enforcement officials in  accordance with U.S. laws.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Definition of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>"Personal  Information" or "Information" means information that 1) is  transferred from outside of the United States to TriNet; 2) is recorded in any  form; 3) is about or pertains to a specific individual; and 4) can be linked to  that individual. Accordingly, this policy applies to you if information linked  to you is transferred to TriNet in any recorded form from outside the United  States.</p>
        <h2>Safe Harbor Principles</h2>
        <p><strong>Notice:</strong> We, TriNet, will  inform you of the purpose for which we collect and use the Personal Information  and the types of non-agent third parties to which we disclose or may disclose  that Personal Information. We will provide you with the choice and means to limit  our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for a purpose other than  that for which it was originally collected.</p>
        <p>Personal Information  includes, but is not limited to: name, employer, title, position held, length  of employment, documents that verify employment, work address, work phone  number, home address, home phone number, country of domicile, copy of  government identity card, copy of passport, date of birth, gender, marital  status, family status, compensation, salary information, tax information, names  and birthdates of dependents and bank information. This Personal Information is  transmitted to payroll and benefit providers and other vendors that participate  in providing customers’ payroll, benefits and other related services.</p>
        <p><strong>Choice: </strong>We will offer you the  opportunity to choose (opt out) whether your Personal Information is 1) to be  disclosed to a third party (other than a vendor or service provider we have  contracted with in connection with providing payroll, benefits and other  related services) or 2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for  which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will  obtain express consent when required by applicable law.</p>
        <p><strong>Onward Transfers:</strong> Prior to disclosing  Personal Information to a third party (other than the service providers  referred to above), we will notify you of such disclosure and allow you a  choice (opt out) regarding such disclosure. We will ensure that any third party  to which Personal Information may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or  is subject to law providing the same level of privacy protection as is required  by the Principles or agrees in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy  protection.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Security:</strong> We will take  reasonable steps, proportionate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information,  to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,  disclosure, alteration or destruction. We have put in place appropriate  physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure Personal  Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or  destruction. However, we cannot guarantee the security of Information on, or  transmitted via, the Internet.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> We will only process  and use Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for  the purposes for which it was collected or authorized by you, including the  purposes to provide payroll, benefits and related services. To the extent  necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure  that Personal Information is as accurate, complete, current and reliable as  necessary for its intended use. Personal Information may only be accessed by  persons within our organization or third-party suppliers and service providers  who require such access to provide you with the services indicated above.</p>
        <p><strong>Access:</strong> We will allow you  access to your Personal Information and allow you to correct, amend or delete  inaccurate information, except, to the extent permitted by applicable law,  where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to  the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of  persons other than you would be violated. If access to Personal Information is  denied, we will provide you with the reason for such denial.</p>
        <p><strong>Enforcement:</strong> We use a  self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Policy and  periodically verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the  information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely  implemented and accessible, and in conformity with the Principles. We encourage  interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided  and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes  regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the  Principles and this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>Amendments</h2>

If we make any material changes we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective.
