No other information is collected through our official websites except when deliberate information is sent to the College (ex., by sending the College an e-mail or providing requested information on a service website).

<p><strong>2.3 Cookies</strong></p>
<p>The College sometimes transfers “cookies” and “applets” to the user’s hard drive through the user’s web browser. Cookies are identifiers that are used to identify a computer, store user preferences and settings, help with sign-in and analyze site operations.</p>
<p>Important things to know about our tracking cookies:</p>
<ul>

<li>All tracking data collected through these cookies is viewable in aggregate form only and does not disclose any personal information.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A cookie can't read data off the user’s hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites.</li>
</ul>
