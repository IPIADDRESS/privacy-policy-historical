<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, process and distribute your information, including Personal Data (as defined below) used to access this Website. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. The use of information collected through our Website shall be limited to the purposes under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use for customers.</p>

<p>If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Data, you may not be able to participate in certain aspects of our Website or content.</p>
<p><strong>Other Information We May Collect:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anonymous Data Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>To maintain our Website’s high quality, we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Website by identifying which areas of the Website are most heavily used, and to display content according to your preferences. Your IP address is the number assigned to computers connected to the Internet. This is essentially “traffic data” which cannot personally identify you, but is helpful to us for marketing purposes and for improving our services. Traffic data collection does not follow a user’s activities on any other websites in any way. Anonymous traffic data may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p><strong>Use of “Cookies”</strong></p>
<p>We may use the standard “cookies” feature of major web browsers. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data-capture mechanisms on our Website other than cookies. You may choose to disable cookies through your own web browser’s settings. However, disabling this function may diminish your experience on our Website and some features may not work as intended.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do With Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contact You</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We may contact you with information that you provide to us based on these lawful grounds for processing:</p>
<ol>
<li>We may contact you if you give us your clear, unambiguous, affirmative consent to contact you.</li>
<li>We will contact you under our contractual obligation to deliver goods or services you purchase from us.</li>
<li>Legitimate Interest. We may contact you if we feel you have a legitimate interest in hearing from us.&nbsp; For example, if you sign up for a webinar, we may send you marketing emails based on the content of that webinar.&nbsp; You will always have the option to opt out of any of our emails.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Process Payments</strong></p>
<p>We will use the Personal Data you give to us in order to process your payment for the purchase of goods or services under a contract. We only use third party payment processors that take the utmost care in securing data and comply with the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted Social Media Advertisements</strong></p>
<p>We may use the data you provide to us to run social media advertisements and / or create look-alike audiences for advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Share with Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We may share your information with trusted third parties such as our newsletter provider in order to contact you via email, our merchant accounts to process payments, and Google / social media accounts in order to run advertisements and our affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing by Others</strong></p>
<p>Note that whenever you voluntarily make your Personal Data available for viewing by others online through this Website or its content, it may be seen, collected and used by others, and therefore, we cannot be responsible for any unauthorized or improper use of the information that you voluntarily share (i.e., sharing a comment on a blog post, posting in a Facebook group that we manage, sharing details on a group coaching call, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Submission, Storage, Sharing and Transferring of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Personal Data that you provide to us is stored internally or through a data management system.
