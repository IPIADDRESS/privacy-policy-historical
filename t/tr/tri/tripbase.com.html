                        We, Cricket Traveling Ltd, are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and we make it
                        our highest priority to safeguard the confidentiality of any and all personal information you

                        This policy sets out the approach that we take to the collection and handling of any such
                        information and applies to all websites, mobile apps and other services operated by us such
                        as newsletters (the "Services").

                    <p>
                        By using the Services you are deemed to agree to our use of your information in accordance
                        with this policy. We encourage you take a few minutes to read through and contact us if
                        you have any queries.

                    <p>
                        In the event of any changes to our approach, we will update this policy and post the latest version

                    <h3>What kind of information we collect?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most information that we collect from you is linked to non-personal identifiers such as anonymous
                        User IDs or device IDs, and does not enable you to be identified as an individual in the offline
                        world ("Non-Personal Information"). Such Non-Personal Information includes things like your browser
                        type, the type of device you are using, access times, the features or functionality you selected
                        whilst using the Services and your general geographic location. As a rule, we will analyze this
                        Non-Personal Information only statistically in order to prevent errors and to improve our Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you choose to register to our newsletter, we will also collect information from you that do
                        enable you to be identified as an individual in the offline world, such as your name or email
                        address ("Personal Information"). Whether or not you provide us with this kind information is
                        always entirely under your control. In order to minimize the impact on your privacy, we will
                        never knowingly collect more Personal Data than is strictly necessary to perform the activities
                        described in this policy.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How and when we collect this information?</h3>

                    <p>
                        We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us during your use of the Services. This
                        can range from Non-Personal Information, such as the dates and desired destination you ask us to
                        run a search against, to the Personal Information you are required to submit where you wish to
                        register to our newsletter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to information that you voluntarily provide to us, we also collect certain Non-Personal
                        Information directly from you as you use the Services, as well as indirectly where it is provided
                        to us automatically by the third party application, social networking site (such as Facebook
                        or Twitter) or other website (such as a promotion partner) that you connect to the Services from.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How do we use this information?</h3>

                    <h4>
                        To deliver the Services

                    <p>
                        We use your information to deliver the Services and the specific features and functionality you
                        request. This includes things like generating the search results that most accurately match your
                        search criteria, storing your Personal Information in order to email you newsletters that you have
                        selected to receive.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        To optimize &amp; personalize the Services
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In addition to using your information to deliver the essential aspects of the Services, we also use
                        it to optimize and personalize your experience of the Services. For example, we will use cookies to

                        As a search engine, this website only brokers the deals of the relevant travel provider websites.
                        Accordingly, a booking is made on the pages of such travel provider booking website. In each case
                        you enter into a contract with the relevant travel provider's website, data will be collected there
                        directly by the third party. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices
                        of such third party websites. When you leave or otherwise cease using the Services, or transfer
                        your information from the Services to a third party platform, we encourage you to read the
                        applicable privacy policies of each and every third party platform that you allow collecting

                        business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your information with suppliers
                        who perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose
                        your information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may disclose information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities.
                        This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative
                        or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your information if the disclosure is necessary
                        for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in

                        transferred to and stored in these countries. As a result, your personal information may be
                        subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries
                        according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries,
                        we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information,

                    </p>

                    <h3>How do we keep your Information safe and secure?</h3>

                    <p>
                        We make the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information our highest priority and we

                        of the information which you share with us at your own risk.
