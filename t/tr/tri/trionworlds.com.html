If so, Trion will post our updated Privacy Policy on this Site located at www.trionworld.com/privacypolicy.php along with notice that the Privacy Policy has been changed so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. Trion may also send registered users of the Site e-mail notifications notifying such users of any changes to the Privacy Policy.
