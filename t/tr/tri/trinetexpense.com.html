        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This privacy policy applies to the websites www.ExpenseCloud.com, 

            www.TriNetPerform.com, www.TriNetExpense.com, www.TriNetTravel.com, 

            www.TriNetMarketPlace.com, and www.TriNetHire.com, owned and operated 

            by TriNet Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (“TriNet,” “TriNet Cloud”). This privacy 

            policy describes how TriNet collects and uses the personal information you 

            provide on our websites. It also describes the choices available to you regarding 

            our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this 

            information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Protecting the privacy of users of TriNet Cloud products is important to TriNet. 

            TriNet makes use of any personal information you provide to TriNet only for the 

            purposes outlined in this policy. To the extent TriNet's International Privacy Policy 

            ("International Policy") is also applicable to your personal information and if there 

            is any conflict between the terms of this policy and the International Policy, the 

            terms of the International Policy will govern.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy does not apply to any information that you may provide directly to 

            third parties including via third-party sites linked to the TriNet Cloud websites. 

            While TriNet actively seeks to ensure that its suppliers and service providers 

            maintain high standards regarding the protection of personal information 

            collected on their websites, TriNet is not responsible for the privacy practices 

            employed by such third-party sites.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The TriNet Cloud websites collect contact, billing, financial, demographic and other identifying information. We, TriNet, will never sell, rent, lend or trade this information in our possession to any other company for the purpose of contacting you regarding commercial services. If you are a TriNet Cloud user, we collect the information necessary to provide our services, collecting it either from you directly or from your employer. This collection is limited to the purpose of providing the service for which you or your employer have engaged TriNet. By voluntarily providing information or by accessing our websites, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, the International Policy. When you download and/or use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID"). 
        </p>
        <h2>Usage Tracking and Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            We track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites, but this tracking is never associated with non-registered individual users. We compile aggregate data mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), and what browser and computing platform you are using.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our sites. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies enable you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide you information that is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our sites. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. We also use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time and remembers your preferences. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our sites, and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our sites, we may collect and store such information in a file specific to you. If you submit questions via our sites, we may post your questions on the sites, and reprint them in various articles and customer communications. We will never include the name, contact or other identifiable information of people who submit questions, regardless of which channel we use to distribute content.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>
            We use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site usage, improve our content product offerings, customize our sites' content, layout and services, and provide our services.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may use the email address, mailing address, and phone number we collect from you to respond to your inquiries and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of our sites. In some cases, we may use your personally identifiable information to inform you of new services, promotions and other matters targeted to your interests. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preference settings of anyaccount you have with us or by contacting us at TriNetCloud@TriNet.com. We use information in the file we maintain specific to you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on our sites, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes and we may evaluate information about you to look for users using multiple User IDs or aliases.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that 

            all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information 

            will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this policy. By way 

            of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose 

            information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, such 

            as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good 

            faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the 

            safety of others, respond to a government request, or respond to any other third 

            party request with your prior consent to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 

            communications. Therefore, although we employ industry-standard practices to 

            protect your privacy, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 

            to be 100% secure. As a result, we do not promise, and you should not expect, 

            that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always 

            remain private.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services 

            to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering 

            customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal 

            information only as necessary to provide these services.

            As a general proposition, we do not sell, rent, lend or trade any personally 

            identifiable information about you to any third party. The following paragraphs 

            describe some of the ways that personally identifiable information about you may 

            be disclosed to third parties.
        </p>
        <h2>Legal Requests</h2>
        <p>
            We cooperate with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, 

            intellectual property rights and other rights. Therefore, local, state, federal, 

            territorial, provincial and international law enforcement can request and may 

            receive your personally identifiable information. By your use of TriNet Cloud 

            websites or TriNet's services (as applicable), you hereby accept these terms 

            and you authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement 

            or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary 

            or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property 

            infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
        </p>
        <h2>Business Transactions</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information as part of a 

            sale or transfer of all or a relevant portion of our business or assets. Any such 

            sale would be subject to appropriate privacy protections for you. You will be 

            notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in 

            ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any 

            choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.

            Suppliers and Other Service Providers
        </p>
        <p>
            We may use third-party suppliers and service providers to facilitate provision of 

            our TriNet Cloud Services. For example, we may outsource the operations of 

            one or more aspects of our sites to a supplier or service provider who performs 

            services according to our requirements. In all cases, we restrict how these 

            suppliers and other service providers may access, use and disclose information 

            received from our sites. We do not permit these suppliers and other service 

            providers to access information about you, other than that information necessary 

            for them to complete the services for which they are contracted. Under no 

            circumstances do we allow them to disclose, sell, rent, lend, trade or in any other 

            way transmit data about you to third parties, and we use contractual means to 

            require them to provide appropriate protection for your personally identifiable 

            information and to use it only for the services for which they are contracted.
        </p>
        <h2>Retention of Information</h2>
        <p>
            We retain personally identifiable information that we collect only so long as 

            reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and 

            to meet legal requirements. In certain cases, information is required to be 

            retained indefinitely. We have a Business Record Retention Policy and an E-
            mail Retention Policy which provide for the destruction of personally identifiable 

            information after it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected 

            and legal requirements have been met.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>

            The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter 

            sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we 

            encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology 

            (SSL).
        </p>
        <p>

            We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 

            information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. 

            No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 

            100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us 

            at TriNetCloud@TriNet.com.
        </p>

        <h2>Referrals</h2>
        <p>

            If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask 

            you for your friend’s name and email address. You must have the consent of 

            your friend to provide us with this information. We will automatically send your 

            friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. This email will identify 

            that you asked for it to be sent. TriNet may store this information for the sole 

            purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral 

            program. Your friend may contact us at TriNetCloud@trinet.com to request that 

            we remove this information from our database.
        </p>

        <h2>Social Media Widgets</h2>

        <p>
            Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook button, and

            widgets, such as the ShareThis button, or interactive mini-programs that run on 

            our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting 

            on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. 

            Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted

            directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the 

            privacy policy of the company providing it.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes in this Privacy Policy</h2>

            We reserve the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice to 

            users of this site. This Privacy Policy was last updated on Feb 3, 2014. Please 

            check here regularly to learn of any changes to this policy. If we make any
