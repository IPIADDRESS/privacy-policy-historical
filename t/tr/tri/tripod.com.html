Our goal is to become your favorite Internet destination by providing the information, services, and product offerings that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, the Lycos Network must collect information so we can understand what makes you different from its millions of other unique users. While you are not required to register for any services on the Lycos Network, some Products and Services may not function properly or may not be accessible unless you do.
</font></p><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
Information collected online is usually defined as being either <b>anonymous</b> or <b>personally identifiable.</b> 
</font></p><ul><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
<li><b>Anonymous information</b> refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Lycos collects some information each time a visitor comes to a Lycos Network site so we can improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience. Lycos collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to a Lycos Network site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). Lycos also collects aggregate search terms from its HotBot and Lycos search services for internal reporting and targeted advertising. Lycos collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. You do not have to register with the Lycos Network before we can collect this anonymous information.
</li></font></ul><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
<ul><b>
</b><li><b>Personally identifiable information</b> refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. Lycos collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of its network of Web sites:

<li><b>Lycos Network Registration:</b> When you register to use one or more sites on the Lycos Network, you provide Lycos with your name, postal address, ZIP Code, email address, birth date, gender, telephone number, occupation, marital status and other information. While not all of this data is required for our services to function, we are better able to customize your experience if you volunteer complete and accurate information. Users who complete the registration process are given a Lycos Network ID and can take full advantage of the many offerings across the Lycos Network.
<p></p>
</li><li><b>Matchmaker.com Registration:</b> When you register to use Matchmaker.com, you provide Lycos with an email address, birth date, and ZIP Code. For members of the majority of the Matchmaker.com communities, Lycos collects your credit card information in connection with your payment for the service. If you complete the Matchmaker.com questionnaire, Lycos collects and posts all of your responses, plus the ZIP Code you provide and any photos or images that you post. At the end of the registration process, you are asked whether you are interested in receiving information about certain topics that may be of interest; Lycos collects your responses to those questions. Occasionally, the "Matchmaker" of the community to which you belong may send a survey to the community; if you answer the survey, Lycos collects your survey responses.
<p></p>
</li><li><b>Other Registration:</b> In addition to registration for various services on the Lycos Network, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by the Lycos Network. As described <a href="#share"><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">below</font></a>, our co-brand partners also ask for personal information. If you purchase premium services from Quote.com or Matchmaker.com, we will ask for a valid credit card number. If you choose not to provide the requested information, the Lycos Network may not be able to offer you some of the personalized services that depend on this type of information to function
<p></p>
</li><li><b>Correspondence:</b> If you contact the Lycos Network, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We do not collect any email addresses of those who communicate with the Lycos Network via email. We use the information provided so that we may respond to the email.

When you use Products and Services designed to post or transmit content (e.g. Lycos Mail, Lycos Communities, Raging Bull, etc.), that content is necessarily stored in our computers for varying periods of time and associated with the registration information for your account. Lycos will not use or disclose such content except as described in this Privacy Policy.

When you register for a service within the Lycos Network, that information is generally collected and maintained solely by the Lycos Network unless specifically stated otherwise at the point of collection.

Lycos runs many promotions and sweepstakes across its Network. These promotions may be sponsored or co-sponsored by third-party companies. Data collected during a promotion is typically shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. Lycos will inform you at the point of collection whether or not we are sharing your personal data as a result of your participation in a promotion or sweepstakes. If you do not want to have the Lycos Network share your data, you can choose not to participate in the promotion or sweepstakes. 
</font></p><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
Be aware that Lycos Network sponsors and other advertisers have links on the Network that take you to external sites. Some of these sites may collect personally identifiable information from you, and third-party advertising networks for Lycos like <a href="http://www.lycos.com/privacy/doubleclick.html"><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">DoubleClick</font></a> may use <a href="#cookies"><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">cookies and Web beacons</font></a> in their advertisements to collect certain information from you. While Lycos hopes that all third parties involved adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users, the Lycos Network Privacy Policy does not cover third-party data collection practices and the Lycos Network does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.

In addition to the personally identifiable information that Lycos actively collects when you register, we also collect anonymous information passively using <b>cookies</b> and <b>Web beacons</b>. This technology plays an important role in making the Internet work, but there is much confusion among Internet users about what cookies and Web beacons are and how they are used. 
</font></p><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
A <b>cookie</b> is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the Web site. This unique number identifies your Web browser to our computer system whenever you visit one of the sites in the Lycos Network. A cookie will not allow a Web site to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed.
</font></p><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
Cookies allow Lycos to automatically remember your Web browser when you visit our Network of Web sites. To help serve you better, Lycos generally uses cookies to
</font></p><ul><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
<li><b>Allow us to deliver products and services more efficiently.</b> By storing certain registration and preference information on cookies or associating cookies with registration, preference or profile information stored on our computers, we can deliver products and services that use such information more quickly and efficiently for more users. This information is normally saved in an encrypted form that only Lycos can interpret.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Prevent others from using your account.</b> On some Lycos Network sites, cookies help us efficiently determine that only one user is logged on under the same member name at a time.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Measure statistics</b> such as audience size and traffic patterns. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your personally identifiable information.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Display advertisements.</b> Cookies let us know whether or not a Web browser has seen a particular advertisement (so we can show you a variety of material) and count the number of advertisements displayed to a particular browser. We also use cookies to customize the advertising you see based on non-personally identifiable demographic information that you provide when you register. Third-party advertising networks for Lycos (like DoubleClick) may issue cookies on the Lycos Network and other sites when serving advertisements. Click <a href="http://www.lycos.com/privacy/doubleclick.html"><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">here</font></a> for information on our relationship with DoubleClick.<p></p></li>
</font></ul><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
<p>
The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major Web sites. It is possible to adjust your Web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. While Lycos does not require you to use cookies, keep in mind that certain sites and services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all cookies.
</p><p>
<b>Web beacons</b>, also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that Lycos may place on Web pages and within Web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, Web beacons allow Lycos to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page on the Lycos Network and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use Web beacons to let us know how many people opened a Web-based email newsletter. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your personally identifiable information.
</p><p>
Without cookies and Web beacons, it would be difficult for Lycos to know which services have a larger audience than others. Tracking audience size helps us to better understand when to launch new services and enhance the current offerings. Keep in mind that any image file on a Web page can act as a Web beacon. Third-party advertising networks for Lycos like <a href="http://www.lycos.com/privacy/doubleclick.html"><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">DoubleClick</font></a> may use Web beacons in their advertisements. 
</p></font><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
Because Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies, you can prevent our Web beacon from collecting anonymous information by setting your Web browser to refuse all cookies or the Lycos Network cookie in particular. Web beacons are built into our Web pages, so non-functional Web beacons will continue to appear even if you refuse the Lycos Network cookie.

<font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
Any personally identifiable information you share with Lycos when registering for Products and Services at any of our Network sites is maintained and accessible only by Lycos unless specifically stated otherwise. Lycos requests information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across the Lycos Network, including personalization services, interactive communications, online games and much more. Most of these Products and Services are available to you at no cost, and Lycos displays advertisements so we can continue to provide great content and services free of charge. We can also better prepare future content based on your interests.
</font></p><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
The following are examples of how the Lycos Network may use the information it collects: 
</font></p><p><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
</font></p><ul><font face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="2">
<li>Lycos uses the information collected (both anonymous and personal) to personalize and enhance the content you see on the Lycos Network, such as news, stock portfolios, weather reports, sports scores, horoscopes, advertisements and more. In some cases, our Products and Services cannot work unless you have volunteered accurate information (for example, we need your valid ZIP Code to display weather conditions in your local area).<p></p></li>
<li>Lycos collects anonymous data and shares it with third-party advertisers in an aggregate form. We will disclose to those advertisers the numbers of Lycos users who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on a particular display. We will also disclose to those advertisers the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed as part of this process.<p></p></li>
<li>Lycos also uses the aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Lycos Network, and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. We do not track what pages individual users are browsing, but rather how well each page performs overall. Without such data, we would not know which parts of the Lycos Network are the most popular, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately.<p></p></li>
<li>Lycos collects an aggregate list of search terms from its HotBot and Lycos search services. This information is collected anonymously and used primarily for the purposes of product development, monitoring, and improvement, as well as targeted advertising. Please note, however, that we may share this anonymous information with third-party companies.<p></p></li>
<li>Lycos sometimes uses an individual registered user's data to "pre-populate" online forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting additional individual data by the Lycos Network, selected third-party sites, and/or sponsors and advertisers.<p></p></li>
<li>Lycos may, from time to time, use your information to contact you about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on the Lycos Network, issues regarding your account, or Lycos Network Terms and Conditions violations or suspensions.<p></p></li>
<li>If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest on the Lycos Network, we will use the information you provided to contact you in the event you win.<p></p></li>
<li>If you told Lycos that you were interested in receiving offers or information from selected sponsors and advertisers, Lycos will send you email about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. For those who elect to receive such materials from Lycos or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their profile, Lycos will release personally identifiable information to the applicable third party. Information released includes name, email address and other information supplied in the Lycos Network registration process.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Matchmaker.com Customers:</b> Lycos creates your public profile by using your answers to the Matchmaker.com questionnaire and your ZIP Code, along with any photos or images you post.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Subscription Customers:</b> Your credit card information is used to collect your recurrent subscription fees for Quote.com, Matchmaker.com, or other pay services.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Lycos Family Membership Customers:</b> Your credit card information is used to verify the age of a parent or guardian. The credit card will not be charged during the Lycos Family Membership registration process, and only the last 4 digits and a transaction number will be stored as proof of transaction.

<b>Know the risks.</b><br>
Meeting new people in an online community (chat room, forum, newsgroup, message board, Web page, etc.) is one of the best things about the Internet, but you should always be careful about disclosing personal information such as an actual name, member name, email address, and so on. This information may be collected and used by others within the online community to send unsolicited email messages from other parties, outside the Lycos Network. Some of the messages you receive may be useful to you, but some may not. In an effort to curtail unsolicited email, Lycos blocks certain email addresses and domains from sending messages to email addresses at our domains.

<b>Educate yourself.</b><br>
Search the Web for as much information as you can about how to protect your privacy. Look for a privacy policy on the Web sites you visit.
