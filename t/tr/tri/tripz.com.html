									</p>
									
									<p><b>Disclaimers </b>
										<br>
										We are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that are inconsistent with this Privacy Policy and/or the terms and conditions under which such third parties are receiving information.

									</p>
									
									<p><b>About Children's Privacy</b>
										<br>
										This Site is not intended for use by children, and TRIPZ.COM™ does not knowingly collect information from children. You must be at least 18 years old to access or use this Site. 
									</p>
									
									<p><b>Update/Change Your Data </b>
										<br>
										To update your email address or change your email preferences (including opting out from any specific products or promotions) please contact privacy@tripz.com.
									</p>
									
									<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy </b>
										We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Site. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site. Users will be informed of changes to this Privacy Policy via the “updated as of” link on the Site. 
										<br>
									</p>
									
									<p><b>Third Parties on our Site</b>
										<br>
										Our Site may contain advertisements, references and links to other web sites and organizations. We may also use third parties to display or serve content and advertising on the Site. These third parties may employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other web sites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours, and even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and we encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.  We do not share any of the individual personal information you provide us with the websites to which TRIPZ.COM™ links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although TRIPZ.COM™ may share aggregate data with such websites (such as how many people use our Site).  TRIPZ.COM™ will use reasonable efforts to advise our users that they have exited an TRIPZ.COM™ operated website and are entering a third party controlled website. Customers/users should read and understand any privacy policy noted on all third party websites.
									</p>
										 
									<p><b>What Else Should I Know About My Privacy When Online?</b>
										<br>
										Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through email, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 
										<br>
										Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. 
									</p>
									
									<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights </b>
										<br>
										Under a provision of California law, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
										<br>
										<br>
										This Site qualifies for the alternative option.  As stated in our Privacy Policy, users of the Site may opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties.  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.  To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on the Site. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
										<br>
										<br>
										California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@tripz.com.  You should put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.
									</p>
									
									<p><b>Your Consent To This Policy </b>
										<br>
										By using our Site, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as specified in this policy. Please also note that your use of the Site is governed by the Terms and Conditions of Use posted on this Site. If you do not agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, please do not use the Site or its products and/or services. 
										Please send any questions about this Privacy Policy to privacy@tripz.com.
