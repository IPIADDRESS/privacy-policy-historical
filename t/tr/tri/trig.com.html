	<h3>Collection of Your Personal Information</h3>
	<p>In order to register as an TRIG MEMBER, you will be required at all times to sign in with a username/e-mail and password. You will be able to access the different TRIG sites using the same username/e-mail and password. By signing in through one TRIG website, you may be automatically signed into other TRIG sites. As part of this registration process, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password etc.</p>
	<p>We ask you when registering to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your postcode, age, gender etc. If you choose to make a purchase over a TRIG Web shop, we may ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, which is used to create an TRIG billing account.</p>
	<p>We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with TRIG. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses.</p>
	<p>When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from TRIG, customized links or similar technologies determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click, in order to provide you with more focused e-mail communications or other information in the future. In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with TRIG, information collected through one TRIG Website may be combined with information obtained through other TRIG member Websites.</p>
	<h3>Sharing of Your Personal Information</h3>
	<p>Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside TRIG and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent.</p>
	<p>We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to:</p>
	<p>(a) comply with the law or legal process served on TRIG;</p>
	<p>(b) protect and defend the rights or property of TRIG (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</p>
	<p>(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of TRIG websites or members of the public.</p>
	<p>(d) The completion of all necessities concerning your contractual member-relationship with TRIG.</p>
	<h3>Use and transfer of Your Personal Information</h3>

We may send certain mandatory communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders and information on technical issues.</p>
	<p>Personal information collected on the TRIG websites may be stored and processed and transferred in the UK or any other country inside or outside the European Community in which TRIG or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. TRIG guarantees that the transfer of private information to other affiliates will comply with this Privacy Policy and TRIG will guarantee the highest level of data protection.</p>

	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>TRIG websites use "cookies" to enable you to register as a member of our partnerâ€™s website, i.e. as an TRIG MEMBER, and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>
	<p>TRIG websites use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly and to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites.</p>
	<p>When you sign in to a site using your username/e-mail and password, the TRIG system stores your unique username/e-mail, and the time you signed in at, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page on the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. The system also uses cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.</p>
	<p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the TRIG Websites.</p>
	<h3>Changes to This Privacy Statement</h3>
	<p>We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our websites and member feedback. When we post changes to this statement, we will e-mail all members. If there are material changes to this statement or in how TRIG will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification.</p>
	<p>We encourage you to review this statement periodically to be informed of how TRIG is protecting your information.</p>
