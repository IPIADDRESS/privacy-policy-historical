These web sites are operated by Trimble Navigation Limited from its facilities 
in the United States. Some of our subsidiaries or programs have their own, 
possibly different, policies. We encourage you to read this privacy policy and 
those of all web sites you visit.</p>

<p><strong>Consent to Use and Transfer Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Please note that if you submit personal data through the Trimble websites, 
you will send it to us (Trimble Navigation Limited), in the United States.&nbsp; We 
will collect, process and transfer your personal data in accordance with this 
Data Privacy Statement but possibly not in accordance with the laws of the 
jurisdiction in which your reside.&nbsp; By submitting your personal data through a 
Trimble web site you consent to Trimble's collection, use, storage and transfer 
of your personal data to our company databases and other repositories, wherever 
located, for the purposes for which it is submitted and in accordance with the 
policies set forth in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Data Collected Online</strong></p>
<p>You can browse most of our web sites without entering any personal 
information. Only general, non-personally identifiable information that Trimble 
logs from all site visits, such as Internet service provider, operating 
system/browser type, and pages accessed, will be collected in those instances. 
This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will not be 
individually identified. </p>
<p>There are times, however, when we or our business partners (such as our 
external service providers identified below) may need information from you. </p>
<p>For example, you may choose to give us personal information when you: </p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>Access or register for access on some of our web sites, for example
  <a href="http://www.gpspathfinderexpress.com">www.gpspathfinderexpress.com</a> 
  or <a href="http://www.knet.trimble.com">www.knet.trimble.com</a> </li>
  <li>Purchase products or services </li>
  <li>Register as a user of Trimble products </li>
  <li>Make requests for materials, customer and other services, and product 
  support, repairs and upgrades </li>
  <li>Subscribe to newsletters and online services </li>
  <li>Enter Trimble-sponsored contests, sweepstakes and other promotions </li>
  <li>Create a user profile to receive future information, special offers and 
  communications. </li>
  <li>Apply to be considered for employment in connection with a job opening at 
  Trimble. </li>
  <li>Register for Trimble Dimensions 2005 User Conference </li>
</ul>
<p>At such times you may be asked to provide contact and billing information 
(e.g., your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number 
and expiration date), as well as information about the product or service 
purchased (e.g., product I.D., serial number, customer number, product version). 
Demographic or other personal information may also be requested, however, 
volunteering such information is optional. By providing the information to 
Trimble you consent to our transfer of this information to our company databases 
and other repositories, wherever located. </p>

<p><strong>Use of Data </strong></p>
<p>Trimble uses personal information collected on its web sites for the purpose 
it is requested or as necessary or permissible under applicable law (e.g., in 
some jurisdictions we may have to keep invoices under tax laws).&nbsp; We also may 
use the information you provide to notify you later about new developments with 
respect to the products and services you have purchased or to inform you about 
new products, special offers and services offered by Trimble, its subsidiaries 
and affiliates ("Trimble Companies") or its business partners.&nbsp; It is important 
to note that you may opt out of receiving further information from Trimble, as 
discussed in detail below. We use non-personal information to analyze sales 
trend data as it relates to geography, time and demographics.</p>
<p>In connection with a job application or inquiry advertised on a Trimble Web 
site, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or 
curriculum vitae.&nbsp; We may use this information throughout Trimble and the 
Trimble Companies for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry.&nbsp; 
Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future 
consideration.</p>

<p><strong>With Whom We Share Information</strong></p>
<p>In the ordinary course of business Trimble will not sell, trade or rent your 
individual identifying information to others. Trimble may share the personal 
data you provide online with Trimble Companies and as described below: </p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>Affiliated Companies and Business Partners.&nbsp; We work together with 
  affiliated companies and business partners who are acting on our behalf for 
  the uses described above. For example, Digital River, Inc. hosts and operates 
  our online store. When an affiliated company or one of our business partners 
  is involved in a transaction with you, we may share personal identifying 
  information related to this transaction. </li>
  <li>Trimble Authorized Dealers and Distributors.&nbsp; We work with and through 
  members of our distribution channel to provide customers and potential 
  customers with product information and customer service. For example, Trimble 
  may forward the contact information of a potential customer to a 
  Trimble-authorized dealer to respond to a customer inquiry about Trimble 
  products.&nbsp; Or Trimble may forward such contact information to enable a 
  Trimble-authorized dealer to furnish customers with a product updates. Trimble 
  requires that its dealers and distributors keep confidential any personal data 
  of customers or potential customers disclosed to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Agents.&nbsp; We use agents to act on our behalf. For example, agents may 
  fulfill orders, provide support, or organize sweepstakes. Agents are only 
  given access to the information necessary to perform their functions and 
  Trimble requires that its agents keep confidential any personal identifying 
  information disclosed to them. </li>
  <li>Mergers and Reorganizations.&nbsp; In the event of a corporate reorganization, 
  such as a merger, acquisition or sale or transfer of assets by Trimble outside 
  the normal course of business, customer information may be transferred to 
  third parties. </li>
  <li>Other Situations.&nbsp; Finally, Trimble may release personal identifying 
  information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably 
  necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of our user
