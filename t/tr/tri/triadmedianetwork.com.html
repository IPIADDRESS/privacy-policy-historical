<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information Collection And Use</strong></p>
<p>Triad Media is the sole owner of the information collected. Triad Media Inc.
  collects information from our users at several different points on our
  Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>We use LinkTrust affiliate management software. We do not collect
  any information other than what is collected via the LinkTrust system.
  You can access the site at www.linktrust.com.</p>
<p>Information Use Profile</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information
  about the user. We use session ID cookies to keep track of a user's order
  when they move through our site. For the session ID cookie, once users
  close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies are required
  for ordering from Triad Media. See http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/
  for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes
  internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider
  (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number
  of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement
  in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
  use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web
  Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us
  what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
  identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the
  online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is
  that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about
  the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied
  to users' personally identifiable information to allow us to keep track
  of the orders of users that have entered our site via third-party advertising.
  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and
  the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Communications from the Site</strong></p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Special Offers and Updates</strong></p>
<p>We send all new customers a welcoming email to verify their password
  and username. Established members will occasionally receive information
  on products, services, and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy
  of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
  Send an email to <a href="mailto:legal@triadmedia.com">legal@triadmedia.com</a><a href="mailto:info@triadmedianetwork.com"></a></p>

<p><strong>Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services
  and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email
  or phone, in accordance with the users' wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve
  user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required
  by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary
  to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal
  process served on our Web site. We do not sell any personally identifiable
  information to third parties. Aggregate Information (non-personally
  identifiable) We do not share aggregated demographic information with
  our partners and advertisers. However, we do store aggregate data so
  that we provide outside sources with general traffic statistics from
  our website (for example, we may use aggregate information in a press
  release that states "traffic
  at Triad Media increased 40% this week.")</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we
  are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We
  encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read
  the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally
  identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information
  collected by this Web site.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>This Web site takes every precaution to
  protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information
  via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
  When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information,
  the user is on a secure page hosted by Directtrack.com, that information
  is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in
  the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form,
  the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator
  and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked,
  or open, when users are just â€˜surfing'.
  To learn more about SSL, follow this link http://wp.netscape.com/security/techbriefs/ssl.html.
  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online,
  we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
  above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information
  to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer
  service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
  information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security
  and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees
  are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy,
  and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.</p>
<p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users
  can send an email to <a href="mailto:legal@triadmedia.com">legal@triadmedia.com</a><a href="mailto:info@triadmedianetwork.com"></a>.</p>
<p>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information If a
  user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code,
  phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service,
  we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally
  identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer
  Support at <a href="mailto:legal@triadmedia.com">legal@triadmedia.com</a><a href="mailto:info@triadmedianetwork.com"></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
  to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate
  so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we
  use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will
  use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the
  information was collected.</p>

<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information
  in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will
  notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not
  we use their information in this different manner. However, if users
  have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated
  their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal
  information be used in this new manner.</p>
