						<a name="1"><h3>1. Scope</h3></a>

						<p>This privacy policy applies to data collected by Cerulean Studios ("Cerulean") through its websites that link to this privacy policy, the Trillian software ("Trillian"), and other software and services that may be provided by Cerulean Studios from time to time (together with Trillian, the "Cerulean Services").</p>

						<p>This privacy policy does not apply to information collected by websites, software, services, plugins, or features provided by third parties (the "Third Party Services") and accessible through the Cerulean Services or otherwise. Please contact the providers of the Third Party Services if you have questions about their privacy policies.</p>

						<a name="2"><h3>2. The Information We Collect</h3></a>

						<a name="2.1"><h3>2.1. Your Trillian Credentials</h3></a>

						<p>In order to access the Cerulean Services, Cerulean requires that you create a unique username (your "Trillian Username") and password (your "Trillian Password", together with your Trillian Username, your "Trillian Credentials"). In association with your Trillian Credentials, we will store any demographic or other information (for example, your gender and age) you choose to provide to us for the purpose of creating a user profile ("User Profile Information"). We may display the User Profile Information that you choose to provide to us when you authorize us to publish it in a public user directory or when you request permission to communicate with other Trillian customers.</p>

						<a name="2.2"><h3>2.2. Your Billing Information</h3></a>

						<p>If you elect to purchase a paid Trillian service such as Trillian Pro, you may choose to pay with your credit card or PayPal account.  All information sent to Cerulean during the purchasing process will be protected with the Transport Layer Security ("TLS") protocol.  In the event that you use PayPal, you will be sent directly to PayPal's servers to complete your transaction.  When you purchase a paid Trillian service, your name and details about the product you purchased are stored on our servers.  We do not store your credit card information on our servers.</p> 

						<a name="2.3"><h3>2.3. Instant Messenger Usernames And Passwords</h3></a>

						<p>At your option, you may request that Cerulean stores certain third-party network account information (encrypted usernames and passwords) on its servers ("Encrypted Third-Party Account Information").  This encrypted information is only accessible by you and cannot be read by third parties, including Cerulean Studios employees.  If you choose to disable the storage of Encrypted Third-Party Account Information, Encrypted Third-Party Account Information will only be stored on the device(s) on which Trillian is installed.</p> 

						<a name="2.4"><h3>2.4. Instant Messenger Contact Lists</h3></a>

						<p>Your contact list (including any groups you've created, notes you've taken, metacontacts, and display names) is stored on Cerulean's servers.  By storing your contact list, we are able to synchronize it between devices in realtime as well as provision new devices with your contact list should a local copy not exist yet.  Your contact list is only available to the Trillian Username that uploads it.</p>
						
						<a name="2.5"><h4>2.5. Instant Messenger Conversations</h4></a>

						<p>Certain Trillian software will offer you the option to upload your conversation logs to Cerulean's servers so that you can access your logs using Trillian software on multiple devices or platforms.  Conversation logs are not encrypted.  The transmission of conversation logs to and from our servers is protected with industry standard encryption, such as TLS.  Conversation logs that are uploaded to our servers are only available to the Trillian Username that uploads them.  Cerulean makes no warranty regarding the availability of conversation logs uploaded to our servers.  You are solely responsible for the content of your conversation logs.</p>

						<p>Versions of Trillian that operate on mobile devices operate by establishing connections to Cerulean Studios' servers. In order to provide services through mobile versions of Trillian, Cerulean Studios may temporarily store recent instant messenger session information and conversations ("User Messaging Information"). This information is stored only for the purpose of transmitting the information back to you (e.g., to reliably deliver messages to a mobile device that temporarily loses internet connectivity, or to provide you with a reminder excerpt of your last conversation) and is not permanently archived unless requested by you as a part of the conversation logging feature. The User Messaging Information is only available to the Trillian Username associated with it.</p>

						<p>Certain versions of Trillian support many-to-many group chats.  Group chat conversation logs are stored on Cerulean Studios' servers to ensure that all participants of a group chat have access to its conversation logs.  Group chat conversation logs are not encrypted.  The transmission of group chat conversation logs to and from our servers is protected with industry standard encryption, such as TLS.  Group chat conversation logs that are uploaded to our servers are only available to the Trillian Usernames that belong to the group chat in question and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.  Cerulean makes no warranty regarding the availability of group chat conversation logs uploaded to our servers. You are solely responsible for the content of your group chat conversation logs.</p>

						<p>Trillian will not otherwise transmit, store, or access the content of your conversations, except as required in order to comply with law, rule or regulation.</p>

						<a name="2.6"><h4>2.6. Shared Images</h4></a>

						<p>Certain Trillian software will offer you the option to upload images you send to other users to Cerulean's servers so that you can access these images on multiple devices or platforms. Images that are uploaded to our servers are made available in the form of a URL that you can transmit to other users for viewing.  Any person with the URL for an image that you have uploaded will be able to access the image. You are solely responsible for limiting distribution of the URL for an image to intended viewers. You can delete the images you upload in this manner using the account tools available on our website.  Cerulean makes no warranty regarding the availability of images uploaded to our servers. You are solely responsible for the content of your images, and will not upload images that infringe or violate someone else's rights or otherwise violate the law.</p> 

						<a name="2.7"><h3>2.7. Web Cookies</h3></a>

						<p>Cerulean may use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information when you visit our websites. Cookies allow us to display your personalized content on your later visits to these websites and allow you to move from page to page on the site without having to sign in again on each page.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the our websites and the Cerulean Services that depend on cookies.  If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. Please refer to your browser's documentation if you would like to disable, reject, or delete cookies. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p>

						<a name="2.8"><h3>2.8. Usage Statistics</h3></a>

						<p>Cerulean may collect information that you make available when you interact with the Cerulean Services. This information may include the pages you view on our websites, website and instant messenger traffic analysis data used to optimize the Cerulean Services, crash reports from the Trillian software, and technical information such as your browser's window dimensions, your operating system, and the time you spend viewing a web page.  We may also collect certain commonly available information that your browser provides to every website that you visit. This information includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the web page you have requested, the referring website (including search engines), your browser software, your browser's language settings, and access time and date. We may also use "cookies" and other similar technology in connection with the Cerulean Services, as discussed in <a href="#2.7">Section 2.7.</a>  Usage statistics are stored on internal Cerulean databases.  Usage statistics are always anonymized and stored in aggregate; individual usage statistics are not tied to any personally identifiable information.</p>

						<a name="3"><h3>3. Others Ways Your Information Is Used</h3></a>

						<a name="3.1"><h3>3.1. Enabling Certain Cerulean Services</h3></a>

						<p>Certain Cerulean Services will not function unless you provide Cerulean with certain personally identifiable information.  For example, the Cerulean Services cannot connect to a third-party communications network unless you provide us with certain required login information (such as your username, password, and any other required information by such network) (the "Third-Party Account Information") and you permit us to share the Third-Party Account Information.  By providing the Third-Party Account Information to us and accessing and using the Cerulean Services, you authorize us to share the Third-Party Account Information with the relevant third-party communications network provider solely for the purpose of establishing and authenticating your session.</p> 

						<a name="3.2"><h3>3.2. Improving Cerulean Services</h3></a>

						<p>Cerulean collects and uses your information to operate and improve its websites and the other Cerulean Services.  These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making our websites and other Cerulean Services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and permitting you to gain access to certain features of the Cerulean Services not available to the general public.</p> 

						<a name="3.3"><h3>3.3. Sending Authorized Communications To You</h3></a>

						<p>Cerulean may also use your information to communicate with you, including sending certain mandatory service communications such as welcome emails, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements.  In addition, we may send periodic emails that are considered part of the Cerulean Services.  We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from us. You may opt out of promotional mailings and surveys from us by disabling receipt of these items in your user account preferences.</p>

						<a name="3.4"><h3>3.4. Disclosure Of Your Information To Others</h3></a>

						<p>Cerulean may hire other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of Cerulean Services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver such services, are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. Additionally, for credit card processing, our fraud detection vendors may use aggregate data to improve their ability to detect fraudulent uses of credit cards.</p>

						<p>Cerulean may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Cerulean or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the Cerulean Services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Cerulean employees, customers or the public.</p>

						<p>In the event that Cerulean is acquired by or merges with another company or transfers substantially all of its assets to another company, Cerulean may transfer all of its user information and data, including information about you (including personally identifiable information), to that other company.</p>

						<p>Except as described in this privacy policy, Cerulean will not disclose your information to third parties without your consent. Cerulean does not sell, lease, or rent your email address or contact information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

						<a name="3.5"><h3>3.5. United States Operation</h3></a>

						<p>Personal information collected on Cerulean Studios websites and through the Cerulean Services will be stored and processed in the United States.  Personally identifiable information may be transferred across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world in connection with the Cerulean Services.  By using the Cerulean Services, you acknowledge that we provide the Cerulean Services from the United States, and you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States.</p>

						<a name="4"><h3>4. Advertisements</h3></a>

						<p>Advertisements displayed on Cerulean's products, services, and websites may be delivered via an advertising management service.  When you use a product or view a web page on our website that contains advertising provided by one of our advertising management services, the advertising service company may place a cookie on or retrieve a cookie from your computer if you have enabled cookies.  This cookie may uniquely designate your computer and web browser, without containing any personally identifying information such as your name or e-mail address. Advertisements may also make use of "trackers" or "web beacons" to collect statistical information regarding the advertisements. Cerulean Studios will not sell, assign, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to any advertising management service.</p>

						<a name="5"><h3>5. Children Under Age 13</h3></a>

						<p>Children under 13 are not permitted to register with Cerulean Studios or use Cerulean Services.</p>

						<a name="6"><h3>6. Deleting Your Account</h3></a>

						<p>You may delete your account at any time by visiting our website and signing into your account.  Deletion is non-reversible and the deleted account cannot be recovered after deletion.  Be sure you intend to delete your account and have made local backups of any data before deleting your account with us.</p>

						<a name="7"><h3>7. Contacting Cerulean Studios</h3></a>

						<p>Cerulean welcomes your comments and questions regarding this privacy policy, including any questions you may have about the particular use of your information. If you would like to contact us regarding this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us by <a href="mailto:privacy-feedback@ceruleanstudios.com?subject=Privacy%20Question">email</a>.</p>

						<a name="8"><h3>8. Changes To These Policies</h3></a>

						<p>Cerulean may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Cerulean Services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this privacy policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this privacy policy. If there are material changes to this privacy policy or in how we will use your information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes on our website prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification.  We encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy to stay informed of how we are protecting your information. If you disagree with the changes to this privacy policy, you may choose to opt out by deleting your account as described in <a href="#6">Section 6.</a></p>
