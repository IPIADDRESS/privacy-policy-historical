class="content-date"><p>Last Updated on August 10, 2019</p></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains the privacy practices of Tubular Labs, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Tubular Labs,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information (as defined below) that we receive through our websites (www.tubularlabs.com and other Tubular Labs URLs and websites), mobile applications and our other services, including without limitation our cross-platform video analytics and intelligence software platform (collectively, the “Services”).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using our Services, you consent to Tubular Labs’s collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with anything in this Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.</span></p><h2><strong>1. Types of Information We Collect and How We Collect It</strong></h2><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third-Party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Tubular Labs and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Tubular Labs may collect Personal Information include:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may provide Personal Information directly to Tubular Labs through interacting with the Services, participating in surveys, during events such as sweepstakes, and requesting Services or information.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We endeavor to collect only that Personal Information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Information You Volunteer</strong>:&nbsp;If you open an Account with us, start a free trial, purchase products or Services, send us an email, complete a survey, or share Personal Information with us in any other way, we collect this information. This depends on what information you choose to provide but it may include your name, email address or billing information. You do not have to share this information with us, but without it you may not be able to access certain content, features or Services.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Information You Post Online</strong>:&nbsp;If you post information on any public areas of our websites (or elsewhere on the Internet) that information may be collected and used by anyone, including Tubular Labs. We strongly recommend that you do not post any information that allows strangers to identify or locate you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Data from Social Networking Services</strong>:&nbsp;In your Account settings, you may choose to opt in and allow Tubular Labs to connect to one or more of your Social Networking Service (“SNS”) accounts (e.g. your Facebook Page or YouTube Channel). Additionally, you may choose to allow Tubular Labs to connect to one or more of your SNS accounts by logging in using that account. If you choose to authenticate through an SNS, Tubular Labs may access data from the applicable SNS platforms on your behalf (such as dark posts and geo-fenced posts) (collectively, “Authenticated Data”). Tubular Labs may use Authenticated Data to improve the Services for you (e.g. by using such data to deliver more accurate statistical data and rankings regarding your Facebook Page) and to improve the Services overall (e.g., Authenticated Data used to improve Tubular Labs’ Services will be aggregated and anonymized and used for purposes such as producing derived market estimations).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also use your SNS account to log into your Tubular Labs account. If you choose to login your Tubular Labs account using your SNS account, Tubular Labs may use your email address as described in Section 2 (How Do We Use the Information We Collect?).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tubular Labs will not make your specific set of Authenticated Data available to Tubular Labs users other than on an aggregated and anonymized basis, unless you have chosen to opt in. For example, if you have opted into the Rank Booster Program, Tubular Labs may make public some of your Authenticated Data, specifically Facebook dark posts, Facebook geo-fenced posts or Facebook Custom Labels, for the purpose of ensuring that all of your video activity is correctly attributed to you within Tubular Labs’ Services). Custom labels are only made search able via the Tubular Web APP to enable custom searches.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may revoke Tubular Labs’ ability to collect your Authenticated Data at any time through the opt-out feature in the Settings section of your Account. In addition to opting out via the Settings section in your Tubular Labs Account, you may also revoke Tubular Labs’ access to SNS Authenticated Data via the SNS security settings pages. You may also revoke Tubular Labs’ access to YouTube Authenticated Data via the Google security settings page, found at: https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you opt into authenticating any of your SNS Accounts with Tubular Labs, Tubular Labs will:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never post on your behalf to any of your authenticated SNS Accounts (e.g. your Facebook Page or YouTube Channel).</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never manage any of your SNS Account ad campaigns (e.g. Facebook ad campaigns or YouTube ad campaigns) and will never alter any of your SNS ad settings.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions or comments about SNS Authenticated Data, please email us at&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:privacy@tubularlabs.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@tubularlabs.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Automatic Collection</strong>:&nbsp;Like most web businesses, we use automated mechanisms (e.g., cookies and/or web beacons) to keep track of user interactions with our Services.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Cookies”</strong>&nbsp;are small text files that are placed on your device by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party service providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such Third Parties.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Web Beacons”</strong>&nbsp;(also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our uses of such technologies fall into the following general categories:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Operationally Necessary</strong>.&nbsp;We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Services. This includes technologies that allow you access to Services; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Performance Related</strong>.&nbsp;We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our websites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, services, or tools;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Functionality Related</strong>.&nbsp;We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our sites;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advertising or Targeting Related</strong>.&nbsp;We may use first-party or third-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our sites or on Third-Party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Log Data</strong>.&nbsp;Our servers also automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-Account holders. Log Data may include information such as an Individual’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that an Individual was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which an Individual browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that an Individual clicked on and other statistics.

We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Tubular Labs related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your Personal Information with Third-Party advertising partners, you may opt-out of such sharing at no cost by following the instructions below.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as Required by Law and Similar Disclosures).</strong>&nbsp;We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other Account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect yours’, ours’ or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iv) to enforce Tubular Labs policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Tubular Labs; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.</strong>&nbsp;If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.

For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</span></p><p><strong>Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may inquire as to whether Tubular Labs is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate.

If Tubular Labs determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Tubular Labs will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</span></p><h2><strong>7.
