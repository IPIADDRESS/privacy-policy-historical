                        <p>Kurtzman Carson Consultants LLC ("KCC") is committed to protecting your privacy and earning your trust. This Privacy Statement describes KCC's privacy practices for the services KCC provides through websites which it creates, configures and hosts on behalf of its clients and for the websites located at http://www.kccllc.com, http://www.kccllc.net and http://classaction.kccllc.net.</p>
<h3>Information Collection &amp; Use</h3>
<p><strong>Client Websites</strong></p>
<p>KCC provides administrative-support services and solutions for the legal and financial industries. Each site visitor ("User") is provided with a dedicated website that houses all pertinent information regarding a specific legal case. KCC typically provides its services through websites that KCC creates, configures and hosts on behalf of the client. KCC operates its websites and collects usage data about Users at the direction of, and in accordance with, the instructions of KCC's clients.<br> <br> KCC's arrangements with its clients may require KCC to obtain certain personal information, oftentimes from the client or a User, in order for a User to access information provided on a KCC website page. Among other things, KCC may collect the following data: (i) User name; (ii) User identification; (iii) User password; (iv) User email address; and (v) User department(s) and location within the client organization. KCC may also track the amount of time a User spends on the client website, the applications the User employs, the reports the User performs, and other activities in which the User engages while the User is on the KCC client website.<br> <br> KCC may use non-personal data that it obtains from Users, such as the amount of time Users spend on a specific portion of a website, to analyze trends, gather data to benchmark best practices, and monitor, improve and refine the functionality of the system. KCC generally only uses personal information to provide feedback about a User's activity on a KCC-hosted client website. For example, KCC may use personal information to inform a User of his or her access rights to case-specific information, to provide feedback on how to more effectively use the site’s features or to explain new features of the system.<br> <br> KCC's arrangements with its clients may require KCC to provide all User information in KCC's possession, including a User's personal information, directly to the client with which the User is associated (i.e., the User's employer). If a User corresponds with KCC, KCC may keep a record of that correspondence. KCC does not transfer any personal User information to any third party (other than KCC's client) unless KCC is authorized to do so by the client with which the User is associated, in connection with the services that KCC provides to its client, or required to do so by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>www.kccllc.com</strong></p>
<p>Individuals may visit KCC's public website, www.kccllc.com, without disclosing any personal information. KCC may track the activity of visitors to this website in order to analyze trends, monitor, and improve and refine the functionality of the site. When used for the above purposes, this data is aggregated and is not stored in any personally identifiable form. Visitors to the www.kccllc.com website may also contact KCC by e-mail at info@kccllc.com. When you choose to submit such information to KCC through e-mail, an online form, or other method, or through a temporary cookie for the sole purpose of using one of KCC’s online forms or submitting information to KCC as described below, you may choose to provide KCC with information in order to request additional information about KCC services, for press inquiries, employment, or for other purposes. By providing KCC with information, you consent to KCC’s use of this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement. Except as described in this Privacy Statement, KCC does not collect any information about you through its website without your knowledge and consent. When KCC receives e-mail, it collects the sender's return e-mail address. KCC uses this return address to respond to inquiries or comments that it receives. KCC does not share personal information it obtains from visitors who send e-mail to KCC with any third parties unless it is authorized to do so.<br> <br> KCC may use a User’s personal information to contact a User concerning the User’s inappropriate use of KCCLLC.COM.</p>
<p><strong>Data Integrity &amp; Data Security</strong></p>
<p>KCC does not process personal information that it receives for any purpose other than to provide administrative-support services and solutions to its clients, pursuant to KCC's arrangements with its clients. Generally, such personal information is provided by either the User or the client with whom the User is associated. KCC maintains such personal information in accordance with arrangements with KCC's clients. KCC has taken steps to ensure that any information KCC collects is secure by, among other things, limiting the number of people who have physical access to KCC's database servers, utilizing electronic security systems, and using password protections which guard against unauthorized access. KCC may, however, aggregate data that it obtains from Users to analyze trends, to gather data to benchmark best practices, and to monitor, improve and refine the functionality of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting &amp; Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>KCC is committed to ensuring that the personal information it receives is accurate. At the direction of, and in accordance with, the instructions of KCC's clients, KCC allows Users who make reasonable requests to access their personal information in KCC's possession and to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information. Users who have questions about personal information on file with KCC may, if the client so provides, access the client website to make such corrections or may contact KCC at the address below.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Session IDs</strong></p>
<p>“Cookies” are information files which your web browser places on your computer when you visit a website. KCC uses cookies and session IDs to authenticate a User as he or she navigates various parts of KCC's websites. Cookies and session IDs may also be used to automate data entry functions. For example, cookies may be used to enable a User to move through a KCC client website without having to retype the User's password. KCC does not obtain personal information from cookies or session IDs, and does not link any data collected through cookies or session IDs to any personal information.</p>
<p>If you access an online service maintained by KCC we may use a tool called “Google Analytics” which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;Google Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the information we get from Google Analytics to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is restricted by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can opt out of Google Analytics if you disable or refuse the cookie, disable JavaScript, or&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use the opt-out service provided by Google</a>.</p>
<p><br> We may share the information&nbsp;we collect via cookies and Google Analytics with our related entities&nbsp;within the Computershare Group including entities located outside of the United States who assist us in supplying our services including through data storage solutions, back-up services and IT support. These entities are generally located in Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Australia. We may also disclose it to others if required to do so by law.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Third Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>KCC websites may contain hyperlinks to other websites. KCC is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites, neither owned nor managed by KCC. KCC is not associated with these third-party websites and does not review their privacy policies. KCC cannot guarantee the privacy of any information that may be obtained by third parties on these other websites. KCC shall not be liable in any way to the User for any delays, inaccuracies, errors in or omissions of any information or data or the transmission thereof. The use of a third party website may be subject to a privacy statement, terms of use, disclaimer or similar legal condition which may significantly differ from those enumerated in this Privacy Statement or elsewhere on a KCC website. KCC strongly encourages you to review the privacy policies of any website you visit before supplying personally identifiable information through that website and to familiarize yourself with the terms, conditions and policies implicated by the use of those sites.</p>
