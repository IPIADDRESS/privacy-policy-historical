“<u>we</u>” or similar pronoun).  We highly value and respect the 
privacy of the personal information we obtain from you (“<u>Personal

</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>how is my information shared with 
other communities?</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">TuneWiki currently provides a number 
of Gadgets which you can use in connection with other online communities 
you may be a part of, such as MySpace and Facebook.  The Plugin 
interacts, communicates and shares information across and between each 
Gadget you choose to incorporate into your online community accounts.  
If you there are updates to your information at TuneWiki, your information 
will be automatically shared, updated and populated across all installed 
Gadgets.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For example, if you’ve chosen to place 
a Gadget on your MySpace page, any information you make available to 
TuneWiki users will be seamlessly updated at your Gadget at MySpace 
and, accordingly, made available to anyone who can view your MySpace 
page.  For this reason, if you choose to use Gadgets, you should 
consider the information you make available on TuneWiki as available 
to all the online communities where you’ve installed Gadgets.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You should also note that these online 
communities are not affiliated with TuneWiki and subject to their own 
privacy policies and user agreements, which have not been reviewed or 
approved by us.  In each case, it will be your responsibility to 
review how your Personal Information is used, collected, stored and 
shared under each online community’s terms and conditions.  We 
are not responsible for your use of or inability to use any online community 
or Gadget installed at such online community, including, without limitation, 
the manner in which such online community may interact with the installed 
Gadget.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>what about information I post to TuneWiki, 
including any forums, chats or blogs?</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you chose to upload or edit lyrics 
in the TuneWiki database, use a forum, import a blog, participate in 
a chat room or otherwise use a feature available through the Service, 
you should be aware that any Personal Information you post can be read, 
collected or used by other users of the Service (and users of online 
communities if you use Gadgets), and could be used to send you unsolicited 
messages or in an otherwise unauthorized manner.  We cannot be 
responsible for any Personal Information you choose to post through 
those means and we recommend careful consideration before you post such 
information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>how can I view, 
update or remove my information?</b></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We do not provide you the ability to 
view or update information we may have in our database.  However, 
if you want us to remove your Personal Information from our database, 
please remove the Plugin from your mobile device or personal computer.  
Personal Information related to the Plugin should be deleted the next 
time our servers are updated, however, any attribution made to you in 
connection with lyrics you post or edit will remain in the TuneWiki 
database.  Please note that if you choose to reinstall the Plugin, 
we will once again have your Personal Information stored in our database 
and you will need to once again remove the Plugin to remove your Personal 
Information from our servers.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Please note that after your Personal 
Information is removed, there may be residual information that remains 
within one of our databases that may or may not contain your Personal 
Information, such as information that may be retained in back-up servers 
or records we may retain for a period of time to comply with legal or 
industry requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect 
and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect 
the personal safety of any individual.  We will not authorize any 
third party to access or use this residual information on a Personal 
Information level for any commercial purpose. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>what choices do I have about 
the Service?</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have any objection to the manner 
we collect, use and share your information, you must remove the Plugin 
from your mobile device or personal computer and discontinue using the 
Service.  Your continued use of TuneWiki constitutes your complete 
acceptance of this Privacy Policy.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>what about security?</b></font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Protecting the security of your information 
is very important to us.  You acknowledge that wireless transmissions 
are not secure by nature.  However, once we receive your transmission, 
we will take reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information 
on our systems.  Within our systems, your Personal Information 
is protected by a “firewall” (a combination of computer hardware 
and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information 
within our computer network).  Unfortunately, no data transmission 
over mobile networks or the Internet can be 100% secure and, accordingly, 
we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose 
or transmit to us via wireless means, online or otherwise.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>does TuneWiki 
use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies?  what 
about third party cookies?</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We currently do not place or use cookies 
at our website, but we do employ web beacons; however, we may use cookies 
in the future.  Web beacons (also called “pixel tags”) are small 
strings of code placed on a web page or within an email for the purpose 
of transferring information.  We and our web analytics provider may 
employ web beacons placed on the pages of our website to help us learn 
things such as what kinds of users our website attract, which lyrics 
most interest our users, and what kinds of content our users like to 
see.  Web beacons are also used to aggregate your data across communities 
through Gadgets.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With respect to mobile devices, we use 
GPS technology to provide and associate location-based information to 
the songs you listen to.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>what about 
other websites, services and communities?</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Please be aware that when you are using 
the Service or our website, you could be directed via hyperlinks or 
other means to third-party websites, services and online communities 
that are not affiliated with TuneWiki.  These websites, services 
and online communities may send their own cookies to visitors, collect 
data or solicit your Personal Information.  The privacy policies 
of these websites, services and online communities may be very different 
from this Privacy Policy.  We are not responsible for the privacy 
practices of these other websites, services and online communities and 
cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected, 
used or shared there. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>what is 
your policy regarding children?</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You must be 13 or older to use TuneWiki; 
we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age 
of 13.  If we become aware that we have collected personal information 
from a child under the age of 13 we will use commercially reasonable 
efforts to delete such information from our database.  If you are 
between 13 and 17, you agree that you received your parent or legal 
guardian’s consent to use and access TuneWiki. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>what about international users?</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">TuneWiki is controlled, operated and 
administered by us from our offices and servers located within the United 
States.  We make no representation that TuneWiki is appropriate 
or available for use at other locations outside of the United States 
or that our collection, use or sharing of data complies with the laws 
of foreign jurisdictions.  If you access  or use TuneWiki from 
a location outside of the United States, you are solely responsible 
for complying with all local laws.<b> </b></font> <br></p>
