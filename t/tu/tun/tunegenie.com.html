  <p><b>PRIVACY POLICY </b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies 
to all of your use of any MusicToGo, LLC ('M2G') services including 
music download and information sites and services (collectively, the 
'Site'). This Privacy Policy is for you to understand how your personal 
information will be treated as you use our Site and services. <b>PLEASE 
READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</b> </p>

<p>We use the information we collect 
about you to process orders and we may, from time to time, collect anonymous 
demographic information that is not unique to you, to help market our 
Site to advertisers or potential business partners. We may disclose 
your name, e-mail address, and other information (including demographic 
information and information about the music you purchase) to the business 
partner linking to this M2G store or service. Please read on for more 
details about our privacy policy. </p>
<p>When you register, or make 
a purchase with M2G we ask for your name, password, e-mail address, 
and postal code. At checkout we also ask for your state of residence 
for tax calculation and credit card information. This allows us to process 
and fill your order and to notify you of your purchase status. </p>
<p>When and if you subscribe for 
services like newsletters, alerts, special invitations or promotions 
or download certain software or plug-ins that may be made available 
by us through our Site, we will use your e-mail address to send the 
information that you requested. </p>
<p>When you participate in a promotional 
feature, we may ask for your name, home or work address, telephone number 
and e-mail address so we can administer the promotion. </p>
<p>When you click on a banner 
advertisement, you pass through our web server before arriving at your 
destination website. We track click-throughs to help us determine your 
interest in particular topics, measure the effectiveness of our customer 
communications, and to help market our Site to advertisers or potential 
business partners. </p>
<p>We may personalize your shopping 
experience by using your purchases and site behavior to shape any recommendations 
we may make about music files, CDs and other merchandise that might 
be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and 
Site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the Site. </p>
<p>We may also use the information 
we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality 
changes to our Site, new services we provide, and special offers we 
think will be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this 
information, please contact us and request that we discontinue providing 
you with such information. </p>
<p>We may collect anonymous demographic 
information that is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, domicile, 
age, gender, preferences and interests. We may disclose information 
to affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of performing 
business services for us. In addition, we may disclose such anonymous 
information to prospective advertisers or business partners. We will 
not sell or otherwise make available personal information about you 
to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. We reserve the 
right to disclose personal information to regulatory authorities, law 
enforcement agencies or as required by applicable law. </p>
<p>M2G uses appropriate measures 
to secure your personal information. Credit card transactions are handled 
by a third-party, which receives your credit card number and other personal 
identifying information process the transaction. </p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file 
that a Site sends to your computer to record your identification and/or 
preferences. The next time you visit our Site, we may use the information 
stored in the cookie file to facilitate your use of our Site and to 
track usage. For example, we may use the cookie file to store a password 
so that you do not have to continually input it every time you move 
to a different section of a password protected portion of our Site. </p>
<p>When you visit our Site, you 
may be directed to other sites outside our service. For example, if 
you click on a banner advertisement, you will leave our site. These 
third-party sites may send their own cookies to users collect data or 
solicit personal information. M2G allows third-party advertisers to 
display advertisements on the M2G Site. These advertisers will place 
a persistent cookie on your computer, which will enable them to recognize 
your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. These 
other sites are not subject to our Privacy Policy and we are not responsible 
for the privacy policies of these third-party sites, or for the use 
of any information that these sites may collect. If you want to prevent 
one of these third-party companies from sending and reading cookies 
on your computer, you must contact each company's Web site individually 
and request that they cease such activity. </p>
<p>M2G is committed to complying 
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our site 
and services are not directed to children under the age of 13. M2G does 
not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age 
of 13. If a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the 
age of 13, we will not collect, store or use any personal information. 
If we receive personal information that we discover was provided by 
a child under the age of 13, we will promptly destroy such information. 
Schools and parents should supervise their children's online activities 
and consider the use of other means to provide a child-friendly, online 
environment. Additional information is available on the Direct Marketing 
Association's home page at <a href="http://www.the-dma.org" target="_blank">http://www.the-dma.org</a>. If you would like 
to learn more about COPPA, visit the Federal Trade Commission home page 
at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov</a>. </p>
<p>By using our Site, you consent 
to the collection and use of your personal information by M2G. If we 
decide to update our Privacy Policy, we will post these changes next 
to the Privacy Policy link on the front page of our Site. If there are 
material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will prominently post such 
changes prior to implementing the change. Any information collected 
under our old Privacy Policy will be subject to the terms of our new 
Privacy Policy. </p>
