</p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?</h2>
<p><i>General data transmission and logging upon Internet access</i></p>
<p>To the extent your web browser, upon accessing our website, automatically transmits data such as date and time of access, URL of the referring website, accessed files, quantity of transmitted data, browser type and version, operating system and/or your IP address, these data will be stored separately from other data that you may provide to TuneUp. These data will be evaluated for statistical purposes and then promptly deleted.</p><br>
<p><i>Information acquired through voluntary submissions by users</i></p>
<p>On some of our sites, we offer a form which allows you to provide us with further items of information, including one or more of the following: your name, gender, date of birth, email address, language, country, currency and ratings of products. We use this information to deliver email newsletters and general promotional and marketing materials on topics of interest to you.  If you do not wish for your information to be used in this way, do not request such services or opt out of such use and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><br>
<p><i>Inventory and usage data</i></p>
<p>TuneUp will collect and use your personal data for the purpose of providing services to you, including completing any and all transactions.<br>TuneUp further collects and uses personal data from you to the extent necessary to enable the use of, or billing for, its internet offerings (usage data). In particular, such data include indicators of your identity and information regarding the beginning and end of, and scope of, the usage of our offerings. For purposes of advertising, market research and tailoring of our internet offerings to market needs, we may create user profiles under pseudonyms. You have the right to refuse this use of your data, as further described in this Privacy Policy. We may not combine a user profile that has been created under a pseudonym with the data of the individual to whom the applicable pseudonym relates. </p><br>
<p><i>Cookies</i></p>
<p>In order to permit full use of the functionality of its internet offerings, TuneUp uses so-called “cookies,” which enable data to be stored on your computer when you access our website. To the extent you disagree with this, you may refuse to allow cookies to be saved.</p>

<h2>What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?</h2>
<p><i>Forwarding to Google Analytics</i></p>
<p>Our website uses Google Analytics, an internet evaluation service of Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google uses the information stored by cookies (as described above) to evaluate your use of the website, to prepare reports of website activities for website operators and to provide other services associated with website and internet usage. Google processes data on its servers in the United States and in certain circumstances provides compiled, anonymized information to third party developers. You can obtain information about the scope and purpose of the analyses at http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html, and you can find Google’s data privacy policies at http://www.google.com/privacy.html. By using this website, you agree to the forwarding of data to Google and the processing by Google of the data collected from you in the manner and for the purposes described above. If you disagree with this, you may refuse to allow cookies to be saved.<br>Profile information provided to us by you is, however, subject to disclosure pursuant to any applicable laws.</p><br>
<p><i>Third Party Service Providers to TuneUp</i></p>
<p>In the event that we contract with a third party to provide some part of the information or service that you have requested, TuneUp may provide your information to such third party, or such third party may collect information from you on our behalf. By written agreement, these third parties are required to implement similar security measures and to process your information only as authorized by TuneUp in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>Please note that personal information provided to this site may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders.</p>

<h2>How Can You Opt Out of Use and Disclosure of Your Information?</h2>
<p>TuneUp will only use your user profile information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or subsequently authorized by you.</p>
<p>If you would like information about you (that is not necessary for the completion of a transaction you initiated) to be deleted from the TuneUp database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support_en@tune-up.com">support_en@tune-up.com</a> and we will remove your user profile information.</p><br>
<p><i>Access and Updating of Information</i></p>
<p>The instructions to review, amend, or delete your information may be found <a href="mailto:support_en@tune-up.com">support_en@tune-up.com</a>. Users may change information at any time and as often as necessary, including by withdrawing your consent to use your data to the extent you had previously consented to such use (such as subscribing to the TuneUp newsletter).</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p><i>Security</i></p>
<p>TuneUp has implemented reasonable security measures to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our security systems include authenticated access to internal databases, audits of procedures, and regular reviews of overall web security.</p><br>
<p><i>Links</i></p>
<p>TuneUp websites contain links to other websites. TuneUp is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. Users should be aware of this when they leave our sites and review the privacy statements of each website they visit that collects information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by TuneUp websites.</p><br>
<p><i>Business Transfers</i></p>
<p>We are always seeking to improve our website and our business. If all or part of TuneUp is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the Profile Information and Activity Data that you have provided to us may be transferred as part of that transaction. In these circumstances, TuneUp will require that the profile information be used by its successor in a manner that is consistent with the TuneUp Privacy Policy in effect at the time TuneUp received the information.</p><br>
<p><i>Amendments</i></p>
<p>TuneUp may modify or amend this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the way in which your profile information is collected, used or transferred, we will notify you of these changes on our website or by e-mail and provide a link to the new privacy statement. If you object to any of the changes, you can have us delete your information from our database by contacting <a href="mailto:support_en@tune-up.com">support_en@tune-up.com</a>.</p><br>
<p><i>Options</i></p>
<p>Users who opt-in may also remove themselves from emailing lists at any time by following the instructions at the end of any email they received from TuneUp.</p><br><br>
