<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General Privacy Policy</strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the world’s most trusted antivirus software company, we aim to defend you against threats in cyberspace. To do so, we may have to collect your personal data to provide you with the best weapons and the most up-to-date security. We do not take your trust for granted so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal data.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on December 19, 2019.</p>
<h1><strong>Who We Are</strong></h1>
<p>This General Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to products and services of Avast Software s.r.o. and its affiliates (collectively “we,” “us” or “our”).</p>
<p>If you live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area">European Economic Area</a>, the Controller of your personal data is Avast Software s.r.o., which has its principal place of business at 1737/1A Pikrtova, Prague 4, Czech Republic, 140 00.</p>
<h1><strong>Privacy Policy Contents</strong></h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle and protect your personal data and the choices available to you regarding collection, process, access, and how to update, correct and delete your personal data. Additional information on our personal data practices may be provided in product settings, contractual terms, or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is intended for you if you are a user of our products and services. If you are a business partner, the privacy notice that applies to you is located here: <a href="https://www.avast.com/partner-privacy">Business partner policy</a>.</p>
<h1 id="personal-data-we-process"><strong>Personal Data We Process</strong></h1>

<ul>
<li>Data collected directly from you or your device relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”), and may include direct identifiers such as name, address, email address, phone number, and online or indirect identifiers such as login account number, login password, marketing preferences, social media account, payment card number, or IP address;</li>

<p>We have balanced the interests for the above mentioned processing operations. You have the right to object, on grounds relating to our particular situation, to those processing operations. For more details please see section <a href="/#your-privacy-rights">Your Privacy Rights</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing Legitimate Interests </strong></h2>
<p>Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough and will not cause any unwarranted harm. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail.</p>
<h3><strong>Systems, Apps and Network Security</strong></h3>
<p>We process Personal Data for network and information security purposes. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This primarily covers the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.</p>
<p>Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of cybersecurity technologies and services which may include hosted and managed cybersecurity technology services, it is necessary for the functionality of our systems, products and services and in our legitimate interests as well as in our users’, to collect and process Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring the security of our own, and of our users’ networks, devices, and information systems. This includes the development of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events (“cyber-threats”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="/privacy/#personal-data-we-process">Personal Data we process</a>&nbsp;for said purposes includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avast.com/c-spam">SPAM</a>);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avast.com/c-phishing">phishing</a>);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents); and/or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other Data Subjects. However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting (by removing any personally identifiable elements) and mitigating the cyber-threats of concern to you, and to secure your network, device and systems. When processing Personal Data in this context, we do not seek to identify a Data Subject.</p>
<h3><strong>In-product and Email Messages</strong></h3>
<p>We have a legitimate interest for messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and products that supplement or improve purchased products.</p>
<p>If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software that go beyond our product that is installed and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems, which may include also our own solutions. We thus have legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you will be most likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time.</p>
<h3><strong>New Product Development</strong></h3>
<p>We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to develop new products or features so that we are able to provide you with state-of-the-art security, privacy and performance products.</p>
<h3><strong>Third-party Analytics (user acquisition, user interactions)&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data for third-party analytics to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products because these analytics help us maintain functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities.</p>
<h1 id="how-we-process-your-personal-data"><strong>How We Process Your Personal Data</strong></h1>
<p>We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use:</p>
<ul>
<li>For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated. For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own finances.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for, minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the normal performance of the products and services.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Processing of IP Addresses</strong></h2>
<p>For paid products including antivirus, virtual private network (“VPN”), and performance, your IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided, for the purpose of facilitating our billing process. Specifically, our third-party billing partner will collect your IP address for its billing process; we do not store the IP address from this process.</p>
<p>For free and paid products including antivirus, your IP address is also processed for the purpose of downloading certain products and malware detection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to our Products’ Policy for specific use of IP address by our products and services.</p>
<h2><strong>No Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling</strong></h2>
<p>We do not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affects you.</p>
<h1 id="how-we-disclose-your-personal-data"><strong>How We Disclose Your Personal Data</strong></h1>
<p>We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, as required by applicable law. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant Products Policy sections. If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.</p>
<h2><strong>Payment processors</strong></h2>
<p>If you opt to pay for use of our services, we will use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us. However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility.</p>
<p>These are our long-term payment processors:</p>

<p>Your Billing Data is processed by the payment processor from whom you purchased the product. Your data is processed according to the relevant processor’s privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Service Providers</strong></h2>
<p>We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and Products Privacy Policy. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such service providers may include in particular contact centers, professional consultants (including for defence or exercise of our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers.</p>
<p>Sometimes these service providers, for example, our distributors, resellers, and app store partners, will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.</p>
<h2><strong>Advertising Companies</strong></h2>
<p>To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads of advertising companies in our products for mobile devices. To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product, which then collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our <a href="https://www.avg.com/consent-policy">Consent Policy</a> which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy.</p>
<h2><strong>Trend Analytics</strong></h2>
<p>We have partnered with our subsidiary, Jumpshot Inc., that uses stripped and de-identified data to build products and services that provide trend analytics for companies. For more information please refer to our <a href="https://www.avg.com/consent-policy">Consent Policy</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Distributors, Resellers</strong></h2>
<p>We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of&nbsp;distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may use your Personal Data to communicate with you and others about our products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data.</p>
<h2><strong>Cookies Providers</strong></h2>
<p>Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products. While using our websites, you will be asked to authorize the collection and use of data by cookies according to the terms of the <a href="https://www.avg.com/privacy/#table">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Analytics Tool Providers</strong></h2>
<p>We use analytical tools, including third-party analytical tools, which allow us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security issues with our products, improve their stability and function, understand how you use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns. We use Service and Device data for analytics.</p>
<p>While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.</p>

<p>Please note that not all of our products use all of these third-party analytics tools. Analytics tolls that we use for diagnosing your product are necessary for service provision. You will find relevant tools listed under each product in our Products Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Public Authorities</strong></h2>
<p>In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law. No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce its legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings</strong></h2>
<p>Like any other company, we too go through its own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Its business decisions and market developments therefore affect its structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable.</p>
<h2><strong>Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors</strong></h2>
<p>We are a global business that provides its products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it processes.</p>
<p>At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission or specialized regimes such as Privacy shield, which legally bind the receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.</p>
<p>Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include provision of our products and services, processing of transactions and your payment details, and the provision of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section).</p>
<h1><strong>How We Protect Your Personal Data</strong></h1>
<p>We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data.</p>
<h2><strong>Administrative Safeguards</strong></h2>
<p>Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Safeguards</strong></h2>
<p>We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize up-to-date&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avast.com/f-firewall">firewall</a>&nbsp;protection for an additional layer of security. We use high-quality antivirus and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avast.com/c-malware">anti-malware</a>&nbsp;software, and regularly update our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avast.com/c-computer-virus">virus</a>&nbsp;definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.</p>
<h2><strong>Physical Safeguards</strong></h2>
<p>Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Otherwise, access is limited to our physical premises. Physical removal of Personal Data from our location is forbidden. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.</p>
<h2><strong>Proportionality</strong></h2>
<p>We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.</p>
<h1><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></h1>
<p>We have products and services designed specifically to assist you as a parent by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under 13 years of age, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. Details about this processing is included in our Products Policy. Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information.</p>
<h1><strong>How Long We Store Your Personal Data</strong></h1>
<p>We will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For Account Data, for as long as you maintain your account;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service. We use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data. The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years. You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our Products Policy. Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, third-party analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease. After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years, however, we have appropriate measures in place, including pseudonymization.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Storage of Your Personal Data</strong></h1>
<p>The data we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as third-party servers in the Czech Republic, in the United States, as well as anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="your-privacy-rights"><strong>Your Privacy Rights</strong></h1>
<p>You have the following rights regarding the processing of your Personal Data:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Right to object - Applies to cases of processing carried out in legitimate interest.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right to withdraw consent - In the case of processing based on your consent, as specified in our <a href="https://www.avg.com/consent-policy">Consent Policy</a>, you can withdraw your consent at any time, by using the same method (if technically possible) you used to provide it to us (the exact method will be described in more detail with each consent when you provide it). The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right to restriction of processing - You have the right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data if: You are contesting the accuracy of your Personal Data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of your Personal Data; the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data and request the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or you have objected to processing of your Personal Data, and there is a pending verification whether our legitimate grounds override your interests.&nbsp;</li>

<p>We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a Data Subject. Should we be inundated with requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months. If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to resolve the situation informally.</p>

Please note, consistent with our privacy by design, privacy by default and minimization practices, we may not be able to identify you in connection with your Product Data about your specific free products and services. If such a situation occurs, please go to your product settings and explore your options.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Your Choices in products</strong></h2>
<p>You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us by adjusting the privacy settings of the relevant product. Please check your product settings to set your privacy preferences there.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1><strong>Antivirus</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Antivirus for Desktop (Mac and Windows)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Official Product Name</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/avg-antivirus-for-mac">AVG AntiVirus for Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/internet-security-for-mac">AVG Internet Security for Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/free-antivirus-download">AVG Antivirus Free</a>, <a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/internet-security#pc">AVG Internet Security</a> (collectively as “Antivirus for Desktop”)</p>
<h3><strong>Core Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>The Antivirus for Desktop provides protection against malicious software by performing key tasks, such as pinpointing specific files for the detection of malwares, scheduling automatic scans, and securing your device against malware.</p>
<h3><strong>What are Product’s Main Features</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CommunityIQ</strong> is a threat monitoring service for Windows and Mac which sends information about a threat detected in your device to our server, so we can observe how the threat spreads and block it. This is vital for the functioning of our Antivirus and our ability to keep your device secure.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>CyberCapture</strong> detects and analyses rare, suspicious files on your Windows. If you attempt to run such a file, CyberCapture locks the file from your PC and sends it to our Threat Lab where it is analysed in a safe, virtual environment. All files are uploaded over an encrypted connection, which means your data is inaccessible to&nbsp;hackers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>File Reputation </strong>provides a real-time comparison with up-to-date list of malware database of executable files sourced from users of Windows who agree to participate in the service. FileRep processes files or their hashed versions to evaluate which are infectious and updating virus databases.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Online Security </strong>is a browser plug-in which needs to be specifically activated which checks if the site isn’t malicious or phishing.</li>
<li><strong>Browser Cleanup</strong> is a module inside Antivirus for Desktop (Windows) which inspects the browser extensions of most browsers, tries to identify malicious extensions and offers to remove them. Browser Cleanup is on by default. You may opt-in for processing of cookie data (internal identifier (GUID), product version, time information, source browser, cookie domain, cookie name, cookie value) for trend analytics purposes, we consequently provide this data set to enable Jumpshot to build products and services. For more information please see our <a href="https://www.avg.cz/consent-policy">Consent Policy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Web Shield </strong>scans data that is transferred when you browse the internet in real-time to prevent malware from being downloaded and run on your computer. By default, Web Shield is configured to provide optimal protection when switched on. If Web Shield function is active and you opt-in for processing of data (internal identifier (GUID), product version, time information, stripped URLs (unless cached), carefully selected aspects of certain pages without identifiers, selected requests) for trend analytics purposes, we consequently provide this data set in a stripped and de-identified form to enable Jumpshot to build products and services. For more information please see our <a href="https://www.avg.cz/consent-policy">Consent Policy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Antispam </strong>is an additional feature which may be activated by you in case you want to be protected against unwanted emails (spam). The software to function must collect information contained in emails, including their content, which were reported by you as spam in order to determine whether an email is spam or not. Please note that Antispam is service of MailShell which is licensed to us, and thus it is this third party which assesses the email and makes this decision.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Personal Data We Process</strong></h3>
<p>While using Antivirus for Desktop, we collect and process the following Service and Device Data (in addition to Account Data and Billing Data, if relevant):</p>

<h2><strong>Antivirus for Mobile (Android)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Official Product Name</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/antivirus-for-android">AVG AntiVirus Free for Android</a>, <a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/antivirus-for-android">AVG AntiVirus Pro for Android</a> (collectively as “Antivirus for Mobile (Android)”)&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Core Functionality</strong></h3>
<p>Antivirus for Mobile (Android) provides people with essential mobile security with added privacy and performance-boosting features. Block malware, check the safety of installed apps, scan public Wi-Fi networks for possible security weaknesses, and locate your phone if it becomes lost or stolen — all with a single app.</p>
<h3><strong>What are Product’s Main Features</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Scan </strong>scans your device and informs you about security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi Security and Speed Check </strong>enables you to scan your network for vulnerabilities, and tests the speed of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Web Shield </strong>scans all data that is transferred over the network in real-time to prevent malware. If Web Shield is activated and you opt-in for processing of Clickstream data (internal identifier (GUID), product version, approximate location, together with stripped URLs and information related to the URL of sites you visit online) for trend analytics purposes, we consequently provide this data set in a stripped and de-identified form to Jumpshot to build its products and services.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-theft</strong> is designed to protect your private mobile data and help you recover your device in case of loss or theft.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>App Locking</strong> is a paid feature, which protects your sensitive apps with a PIN, pattern, or fingerprint.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>App Insights </strong>provides information about how much time you spend using each app and allows you to view which permissions are required by each of your installed apps.</li>
<li><strong>Boost RAM</strong> to kill any apps running in the background of your device.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Clean Junk</strong> analyzes the space on your device and displays the amount of storage space that is being used by junk files.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Data Usage</strong> monitors your data consumption and helps you avoid additional charges by notifying you when you approach the limit.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Photo Vault</strong> allows you to protect access to your photos with a PIN code.</li>

<h1><strong>AntiTrack</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Official Product Name</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/antitrack">AVG AntiTrack</a> (collectively as “AntiTrack”)</p>
<h2><strong>Core Functionality</strong></h2>
<p>As you browse the web, profiles of your behavior are compiled and linked to you via cookies and fingerprint-based tracking technologies. This data is then shared and sold by analytics and ad-tech firms. AntiTrack removes cookies and masks the device’s “fingerprint” to prevent third-parties from identifying you and following your behavior across the web.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What are Product’s Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AntiFingerprinting</strong> stops scripts from fingerprinting the user’s device and tracking their browsing behavior across the web. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale and AntiTrack version.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Score</strong> provides the user with an evaluation of how private they are based on various in-app configurations. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, AntiTrack version, In-app settings (such as features that are turned on/off).</li>
<li><strong>Clears your browsing history and cookies</strong> helps the user manage their browsing history and cookies by allowing them to manually clear them or schedule automatic clearing at their discretion. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, AntiTrack version, In-app settings (such as features that are turned on or off).</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Core Functionality</strong></h2>
<p>SafePrice is a browser extension available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. Whenever you visit an online shop or product site, SafePrice will show relevant price comparison and discount coupons.</p>
<h2><strong>What are Product’s Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discount coupons</strong> and other promotional offers are typically provided by store owners to incentivize purchases.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price Comparison</strong> looks for specific portions of the HTML code which allows it to identify basic information about the product you are shopping for – product name, SKU and current price. We then compare this information with a database of prices provided by our partners, and offer cheaper prices for the same product where available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information about available offers, coupons or cheaper prices is obtained from Ciuvo. We request this content based on the information obtained from the page, your language settings, country level location and search query within SafePrice.

<p>Online Security is a browser extension (or plug-in) available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. Whenever you visit a website we check if the site isn’t malicious or phishing. We are able to provide you with this functionality by processing URLs.</p>
<h2><strong>What are Product’s Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antivirus</strong> checks the links in search results so user knows if the page is trying to spread malware.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-phishing</strong> identifies and blocks phishing sites trying to steal your data.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Tracking</strong> blocks annoying tracking cookies that collect data on your browsing activities.</li>
<li><strong>Reputation rating</strong> allows users to rate websites. Participation is voluntary.</li>
<li><strong>Bank Mode</strong> works only when Antivirus is installed and offers to user to open page in a safe sandbox environment on sensitive sites (banking).</li>
<li><strong>Marking search results</strong> to show if the site is safe or not even before user visits it.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Secure Browser</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Official Product Name</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.avg.com/en-ww/secure-browser">AVG Secure Browser</a></p>
<h2><strong>Core Functionality</strong></h2>
<p>Secure Browser is a product currently offered for PC Windows and is available in Beta for Mac users.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What are Product’s Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Browser Security &amp; Privacy Center </strong>is built in Security &amp; Privacy Center which is a curated collection of some key security and privacy features, tools and settings, organized into one management console making it easier for you to control and manage your online privacy and security.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Phishing </strong>blocks malicious websites and downloads to help prevent your personal computer from becoming infected with viruses,&nbsp;spyware, and&nbsp;ransomware.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Cleaner</strong> cleans your browser history, cached images, cookies including both first-party and third-party cookies, and other junk with just one click, to keep your activity private and free up disk space.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stealth Mode</strong> prevents your browsing history from being stored and removes any tracking cookies (both first-party cookies and third-party cookies) or web cache you pick up during that browsing session.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Phishing V2 (Phalanx)</strong> blocks malicious websites and downloads to help prevent your personal computer from becoming infected with viruses,&nbsp;spyware, and&nbsp;ransomware.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adblock</strong> stops Ads being shown in your browser using publicly available so called blocking lists. AdBlock usually does not remove ads, it already prevents them from being loaded and thus also speeds up browser experience.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Tracking</strong> prevents the user from being tracked across websites by avoiding tracking cookies to be created. This is done using publicly available so called blocking lists. Anti-Tracking usually does not remove the tracking cookies, instead it already prevents them from being loaded and created and thus also speeds up browser experience.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Fingerprinting</strong> prevents the user from being tracked across websites using browser fingerprinting techniques. As fingerprinting itself cannot be prevented or avoided, this feature prevents being tracked by altering the digital fingerprint of the users browser or PC combination in a way that 3rd party sites cannot re-identify it.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Personal Data We Process</strong></h2>
<p>By default, Security Browser processes locally on your system the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browsing history information; for example Secure Browser may store the URLs of pages that you visit, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages. If the prerendering feature is turned on, a list of IP addresses linked to those pages may also be stored for some period of time;</li>
<li>Name, surname, email or passwords to help you fill out forms or signs in to sites you visit;</li>
<li>Permission that you have granted to websites;</li>
<li>Cookies or data from websites that you visit;</li>
<li>Data saved by add-ons;</li>
<li>Record of what you downloaded from websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>These data is not sent to our environment. You can manage this data within Secure Browser under the “Advanced” section of the Settings page.</p>
<p>In our environment we process the following Service and Device Data while using Secure Browser:&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Secure VPN</strong></h1>
<p>We are a leading provider of security and privacy tools and therefore we are deeply committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Our <a href="/#vpn-policy">VPN Policy</a>. (together with any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.</p>

<h1 id="vpn-policy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>VPN Policy</strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a virtual private network (“VPN”) is like going undercover while you are on the Internet. We provide VPN services that allow you to be on the Internet anonymously and securely from anywhere in the world. While we respect your privacy and take strenuous measures to protect it, it does not mean that you are totally anonymous to us.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this section of VPN Policy, we would like you to know what kind of personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us when you use our VPN services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We treat this data differently than we do for other applications as it can be of such a sensitive nature, so we want you to understand clearly how we process it, on what legal bases, whether we transfer or disclose it, and how long we retain it, in accordance with relevant laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Personal Data Collection and Use</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal data is understood as any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, and includes the information you provide to us while using our VPN services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More specifically, we may collect and process data about you in the following situations:</span></p>

<h2><strong>Account Creation and Management</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you create an account with us (note: this is necessary in order for you to use some of our applications or some of their functions), we will need some information about you.

<h2><strong>Service Data from our VPN Clients</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to make sure our VPN clients do their job properly and improve them, we have to know how people, as a whole, interact with them.

<h2><strong>Third-party Analytics In Our VPN Products</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To analyze the application events mentioned section 1.4, and understand how our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our own analytics tools as much as possible. But sometimes, we need to rely on third-party tools that address specific issues in ways we don’t have the ability to replicate. Whenever possible, we anonymize, masque, or in other ways try to limit your exposure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy policies. You will find that these tools are also listed under the broader section Service Data of this privacy policy which covers all our products, however in the interest of full transparency, we cover here in detail how the relevant ones are used for our VPN products:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of our applications. While Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, we’ve opted to use our own anonymizing identifiers instead. Therefore it doesn’t contain any information that could personally identify you. Still, you can opt out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, you can opt out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Google service helps us to improve the application stability, pinpoint things that don’t work, and improve your experience. Its implementation doesn’t contain any information that can personally identify you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to </span><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s privacy policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>AppsFlyer Analytics on iOS and Android</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AppsFlyer helps us understand how effective our marketing campaigns are by letting us know which ones directed you to us. The data collected here is subject to AppsFlyer’s privacy policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can opt out of AppsFlyer Analytics in the settings of our applications, or by opting out by following the </span><a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions in their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Deprecated Analytics</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re still on older versions of our applications, the following analytics are embedded in them. We highly recommend that you upgrade to later versions as they no longer use these:</span></p>
<ul>

<h1><strong>Where and How Long We Store Your Personal Data</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Where We Store Your Data</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use our service, you may be using servers located in a variety of different countries. However, there is a difference between use and storage. What little information that gets generated by your use of our infrastructure does not get stored outside of the Czech Republic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be some instances where, as a matter of necessity, we need to transfer data outside of these two jurisdictions. When we process the data within our group, regardless of where we are, we always implement the same level of data protection afforded by the European General Data Protection Regulation to all personal data we process. Where we cooperate with third parties which are involved in data processing, we legally bind any party we deal with to adhere to those high levels of protection with standardized contracts approved by the European Commission, and to ensure your rights are protected in accordance with this privacy policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We always strive to protect your data to the maximum extent we can.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using the service, you acknowledge this transfer, storing or processing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How Long We Store Your Data</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning storage or retention periods, the specific terms applicable to the various types of data used for various purposes are noted in their respective sections. After these periods elapse, we will delete this data and no longer use it for that specific purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These retention periods may be longer where it is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or legal orders, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, including in the court of law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Disclosure of Your VPN information</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a rule, we do not disclose any information to other commercial parties, with the following exceptions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Avast Group</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we are part of the Avast Group, information may be shared with members of the Avast Group in order to execute on the provisions of this service, for direct marketing, or to help our product development. In all cases, they are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Provision of Services</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be necessary to share some data with select parties to deliver the product or service you require — such as with a payment card provider who we use to process your credit card transaction, or to do perform website analytics. The information that is collected and shared with those parties is outlined above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Legal Requirements</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event we are served with valid subpoenas, warrants, or other legal documents (for example, documents concerning the sale of all or part of our business or a merger), or where applicable law compels us to comply, or when we are required to defend the rights or property of the Avast Group, including the security of our products and services, and the personal safety, property, or other rights of our customers and employees — we may share your personal data as collected above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Whatever the Circumstance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Avast does NOT store the originating IP addresses of our users when connected to our VPN service, and thus cannot identify users when provided the IP address of one of our servers. We are also completely unable to disclose any information about the applications people use, the services they employ, or the websites they visit while using our VPN. We simply do NOT store this information.”</span></p>
