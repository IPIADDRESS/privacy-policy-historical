<p class="style1">
				TutorVista.com has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to
                customer privacy. Privacy on the TutorVista.com web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us.
                Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this
                Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve
                the right to change this Statement at any time, so please visit TutorVista.com regularly to review our
                privacy statement. <br><br>

				If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact the Privacy Program
                Office of TutorVista.com by emailing <!--<script language='javascript'>putEmailLink('care');</script> -->
				<a href="mailto:care@tutorvista.com" class="anchor">care@tutorvista.com</a>., or by calling 
				1-866-735-0516 <font style="font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> ( available 10.30am to 10.30pm EST ).</font>

				          <div align="left" class="subheading">Collected Information</div> <br>
			
<p class="style1">     
				We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service")
                to give us contact information, such as their name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and
                billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the school grade and
                subjects to use the service. We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you
                interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of
                information when your Web browser accesses www.tutorvista.com. More information on our use of "cookies"
                can be found below. <br><br>

                TutorVista.com uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for our customers. We may
                also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the
                Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions
                and events. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or
                shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information
                from us, at any time by sending an email to <!--<script language='javascript'>putEmailLink('care');</script> -->
				<a href="mailto:care@tutorvista.com" class="anchor">care@tutorvista.com</a>. 																																	
				Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to 
				receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and 
				will send a Customer Newsletter. <br><br>

                In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and
                services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your
                personal or professional interests, experience with our products and services, and more detailed
                contact preferences. Customers and visitors always have the option of choosing not to provide us
                with this information. <br><br>

                Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, we do not disclose to third parties
                the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is
                used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This
                billing information is not used by TutorVista.com for marketing or promotional purposes. TutorVista.com
                uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary uses the
                information for the sole purpose of credit card processing. <br><br>

                TutorVista.com may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as
                Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer
                our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze
                non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers
                and provide such information to third parties. <br><br>

<p class="style1">  
                TutorVista.com has a number of relationships with business partners with whom we may share your
                personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order or completing
                a transaction. For example, we use certain vendors for the purpose of providing credit card
                transaction and check processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such
                as credit card number or checking account number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so,
                they have access to data about users, but they are prohibited from using this information for any
                other purpose. We also strongly urge you to read the privacy policy of our business partner at the
                business partners site. <br><br>

                Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon, that allows a web site to count users who have                visited that page or to access certain cookies. TutorVista uses web beacons in the following ways: <br><br>

				Within the TutorVista web sites <br><br>
   				•TutorVista uses web beacons within the TutorVista web sites in order to count users and to recognize users by
				accessing TutorVista cookies. <br><br>
				
				•Being able to access TutorVista cookies allows us to personalize your experience when you visit TutorVista

<p class="style1">
                TutorVista's practice is to include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics) 
				that TutorVista, or its agents, sends in order to determine which email messages were opened and to note whether a 
				message was acted upon. <br><br>

				In general, any file served as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. TutorVista may 
				also include web beacons from other companies within pages served by TutorVista so that TutorVista's advertisers 
				may receive auditing, and reporting. <br><br>
