                TutorVista.com has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to
                customer privacy. Privacy on the TutorVista.com web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us.
                Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this
                Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve

                privacy statement.<br><br>
                If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact the Privacy Program
                Office of TutorVista.com by emailing info@tutorvista.com, or by calling 866-735-0516.

                We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service")
                to give us contact information, such as their name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and
                billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the school grade and
                subjects to use the service. We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you
                interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of
                information when your Web browser accesses www.tutorvista.com. More information on our use of "cookies"
                can be found below.<br><br>

                TutorVista.com uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for our customers. We may
                also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the
                Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions
                and events. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or
                shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information
                from us, at any time by sending an email to info@tutorvista.com. Separately, customers are also asked
                to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and
                password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a
                Customer Newsletter.<br><br>

                In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and
                services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your
                personal or professional interests, experience with our products and services, and more detailed
                contact preferences. Customers and visitors always have the option of choosing not to provide us
                with this information.<br><br>

                Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, we do not disclose to third parties
                the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is
                used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This
                billing information is not used by TutorVista.com for marketing or promotional purposes. TutorVista.com
                uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary uses the
                information for the sole purpose of credit card processing.<br><br>

                TutorVista.com may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as
                Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer
                our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze
                non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers
                and provide such information to third parties.

                personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order or completing
                a transaction. For example, we use certain vendors for the purpose of providing credit card
                transaction and check processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such
                as credit card number or checking account number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so,
                they have access to data about users, but they are prohibited from using this information for any
                other purpose. We also strongly urge you to read the privacy policy of our business partner at the
