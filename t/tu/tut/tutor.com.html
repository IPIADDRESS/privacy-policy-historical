<h3>Information Collected on this Site</h3>
<h4>USER-PROVIDED INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We may collect Personal Information from users when they register or create an account on our Site, or through other ways such as through such user's activities, transactions and completion of surveys or other similar types of canvassing and other online forms on our Site. We may also obtain the date, time and content of messages in the course of your use of our products or services as well as any transcripts or content provided during real-time or asynchronous tutoring sessions. You may provide this information directly to us or consent to us receiving it from a third party (such as Facebook).

<h4>SITE USAGE INFORMATION</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cookies. We and our service providers may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you, and to create a personalized web experience. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your device’s web browser. Cookies track where you travel on our Site and what you look at and purchase. By using this Site, you agree to the use of cookies in this way. Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.

However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.</li>
<li>Clear GIFs. We and our service providers may use “clear GIFs” (a/k/a “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on the Site and/or in our communications (e.g., in our HTML-based e-mails) which enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received or opened a message. This allows us to know the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</li>

Your school, college or university, or other institution may arrange for your participation in these programs and negotiate a special price or trial offer, or purchase (or subsidize) products or services on your behalf. We may share the Personal Information and other information that you provide to us through your participation in these programs, including test scores and the transcripts of on-demand tutoring and on-line class sessions and comments you leave in post-session surveys, with the institution arranging for your access to these programs, or with your parents or guardians. In addition, your school may require us to share such information with others legally entitled to access your academic records, such as your state department of education. If your parents or guardians pay for your account, we may share such information with them.
