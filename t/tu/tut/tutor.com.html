        Tutor.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 
        firm commitment to the privacy concerns of our users. We only ask you 
        to provide information that we need in order to deliver the service you 
        have requested. We do not share the information you give us without your 
        explicit permission to do so. Your information is completely secure within 
        our internal systems. The following discloses our information gathering 
        and dissemination practices for this Web site: Tutor.com.</p>
      <p>This site contains links to other sites. Tutor.com is not responsible 
        for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. From time 
        to time, tutors will have the opportunity to participate in special programs 
        and will be able to opt in to programs that will require the transfer 
        of their information to other parties. This will occur only with prior 
        permission from the tutor. <br>

      <span class="subheader">Services that Require Registration</span><br>
      Some of our most useful services are personalized; different visitors get 
      different results based on information they provide. For example, if a student 
      creates an account and signs in, he/she can see recently selected tutors, 
      recently selected subjects and a debit account balance. All or part of tutoring 
      sessions are recorded for quality control purposes. Tutor.com reserves the 
      right to review the tutoring sessions for all purposes on behalf of the 
      learners and tutors, respectively. Tutors must create an account to become 
      a Tutor.com tutor. Registration for these services is required to facilitate 
      customization of your individual results. 
      <p>Please note, if you do not logout once registered for services that require 
        registration, other users may view some of your personal information if 
        they have access to your computer.</p>
      <p>We need to collect this personal information from you for specific reasons. 
        Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information 
        (like their name and address), unique identifiers (like their email address), 
        and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). 
        We use customer contact information from the registration form to send 
        the user information about our company and promotional material from some 
        of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact 
        the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; 
        see the Opt-In/Out section below. Financial information that is collected 
        is used to bill the user for products and services. Your email address 
        is necessary as a unique identifier when you create an account and is 
        used to send you confirmation that you are registered. You need to choose 
        a secret password so that you can keep the personal information that you 
        enter on Tutor.com private. If you are a tutor, we request more extensive 
        information, such as address and educational history, for use in creating 
        your profile. All information you provide, including your email address 
        is uniquely identifying and is not shared with anyone outside Tutor.com, 
        unless you first give us your permission.</p>
      <p>Please note, it you choose to participate in our online discussion boards, 
        your posts will be publicly accessible, as will the username and email 
        address you use. We encourage you to exercise caution when deciding to 
        disclose this personal information.</p>
      <p>Tutor.com supplements the information that you provide with information 
        that is received from third parties, such as Kroll Background America 
        if you elect to have a background check.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="subheader">Homework Help</span><br>
        Tutor.com is committed to fully complying with the Children's Online Privacy 
        Protection Act of 1998. We urge children to check with their parents before 
        entering information on any Web site and we encourage parents to discuss 
        with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal 
        information to anyone they don't know.</p>
      <p>For Homework Help, we request only an email address to verify a user. 
        Tutor.com does not sell, market, trade, or otherwise share personally 
        identifiable information with any third party. If there is any change 
        in this policy in the future, Tutor.com will notify a child's parent to 
        get his or her consent. Parents have the right to consent to the collection 
        and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the 
        disclosure of that information to third parties.</p>
      <p>Parental Control of Information<br>
        At Tutor.com, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have 
        a safe online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents 
        can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review 
        any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information 
        deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection of use of 
        their child's information. <a href="/registration/parental_consent_form.pdf">You can link to the form here</a>. 
        Tutor.com takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information 
        about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent 
        or legal guardian. <br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="subheader">Opt-In/Out of Requests for Information</span><br>
        Tutor.com offers several opportunities to receive information, such as 
        newsletters. You indicate that wish to receive this information by checking 
        a box on a form. If you do not ask for it, nothing will be sent to you 
        and nothing will be shared with third parties. </p>
      <p>We also give users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communication, 
        such as email, from us and our partners by completing the unsubscribe 
        option from the email. This site gives users the option of having their 
        information removed from our database if the user no longer wants to use 
        our services.</p>
