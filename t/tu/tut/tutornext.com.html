			<p>

				tutorNEXT.com has a number of relationships with business partners with whom we may share your personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order or completing a transaction.

			</p>
			<h3 class="orange">Web Beacons</h3>

			<p>
				Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon, that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. tutorNEXT uses web beacons in the following ways: 
			</p>
			<p>
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Within the tutorNEXT web sites tutorNEXT uses web beacons within the tutorNEXT web sites in order to count users and to recognize users by accessing tutorNEXT cookies.
					</li>
					<li>
						Being able to access tutorNEXT cookies allows us to personalize your experience when you visit tutorNEXT web sites that are located both on and off of the <a class="red" href="http://www.tutorNEXT.com"> www.tutorNEXT.com</a> domain.
					</li>

				</ul>
			<p></p>
			<h3 class="orange">HTML eMail</h3>
			<p>
				tutorNEXT's practice is to include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics) that tutorNEXT, or its agents, sends in order to determine which email messages were opened and to note whether a message was acted upon.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, any file served as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. tutorNEXT may also include web beacons from other companies within pages served by tutorNEXT so that tutorNEXT's advertisers may receive auditing, and reporting.
