						Tuzara takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more 
						about our privacy policy. We use the information we collect about you to 
						process orders and to personalize your experience at our website. This privacy 
						statement explains how we gather information and how we protect your privacy. 
						The Tuzara Interactive Social Exchange is a private adult (18 and over) 
						interactive entertainment community that enables its members to interact via 
						integrated media and live events. Tuzara was founded to create an interactive 
						network of interesting and active young professionals who enjoy socializing at 
						live events and for whom the Internet is their primary entertainment, media and 
						information resource. Tuzara, LLC ("TUZARA") believes that communities can only 
						truly be built through interaction and participation among members based on 
						trust, privacy and freedom of expression. In order to do this, we must ask for 
						certain personal information.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						We make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system. 
						Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 
						100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information 
						you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp;<br>
						This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tuzara does not 
						own or control, or to people that Tuzara does not employ or manage.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						<b>Except where you are expressly informed otherwise or as described immediately 
							below, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal 
							information except to the financial institution that processes your credit card 
							or check transaction unless required by law or for the protection of your 
							membership.<br>
							<br>
							The Information We Gather</b><br>
						To accomplish our goal of creating an interactive entertainment and networking 
						community, we must gather personal information, which may or may not include: 
						customer-specified Tuzara..com username, gender, age, ethnic background, 
						appearance, religion, income range, occupation, preference/lifestyle 
						information and general geographic location. Much of this information is 
						optional, and meant to be seen by members and visitors to the site but cannot 
						be used to identify a specific member by name, address, etc. Some information 
						is gathered from members and guests who apply for the various services our site 
						offers. This information includes, but is not limited to: email address, first 
						name, last name, birth date, credit card number or checking account information 
						for payment, a user-specified password, mailing address, Zip Code/Postal Code and 
						telephone number.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						<b>Ordering Online.</b> When you order, we need to know your name, email 
						address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows 
						us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order 
						status.&nbsp;<br>
					</p>
					<p><b> Promotions, Online Surveys &amp; Announcements.</b> If you decide to 
						participate in an online survey, subscribe to an email list, enter a contest or 
						use one of our other promotional features, we may ask for your name, address, 
						email address and other pertinent information to administer the contest, 
						tabulate survey results or add you to subscriber lists. Contact and other 
						information collected for contests will be used to notify the winners and award 
						prizes.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Browsing.</b> We may use "cookies" to help us process your order and to 
						customize information that we may present to you. A cookie is a small text file 
						that does not personally identify users, although it does identify a user's 
						computer. Cookies do not pose a threat to your computer, and they do not 
						contain viruses. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can 
						change this feature in your browser. Once the user closes their browser, the 
						cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects a cookie, they may still use our 
						site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas 
						on our site. We occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and target the 
						interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site or for advertising 
						tracking purposes. In addition, cookies may be used on our site to allow 
						enhanced capabilities such as chat. We do not and will not use cookies to 
						collect private information from any user. Some of our business partners may 
						use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access 
						to or control over these cookies.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						Some information supplied by the user is intended to be viewed by visitors 
						(e.g. information contained in public profiles, public and private Showcases, 
						etc.) to the site. This information cannot be used to identify a specific 
						member by name, address, etc.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Tuzara.com Affiliate Partners.</b> The Affiliate Partner program is a 
						vehicle for other activity, entertainment and lifestyle sites, organizations 
						and professionals to link to the Tuzara.com site. Information submitted by the 
						Affiliate Partner is used for establishing and maintaining a business 
						relationship. No personal or business information is shared outside the 
						relationship between Tuzara..com and the Affiliate Partner. Affiliate Partners 
						may not view or access private information on Tuzara.com subscribers.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Aggregate.</b> This is information we collect that is not personally 
						identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered 
						for all users to the site.&nbsp;<br>
						Communicating with Tuzara. We primarily use Email addresses submitted by 
						members to verify enrollment and when forwarding event announcements and 
						responses to personal advertisements. Respondees' email addresses are not 
						disclosed to the responder. We may also use a user's email address to send news 
						regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this type 
						by emailing <a href="mailto:support@tuzara.com" class="ttext">support@tuzara.com</a>
						. Email addresses may also be used in private correspondence with the user for 
						customer service issues. Financial information that is collected is used to 
						bill the user for products and services. All other private information 
						submitted by the user is confidential and will not be disclosed except as 
						required by law or to protect members of Tuzara.com. All private information 
						can be updated or deleted by the user at any time.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						<b>Links.</b> This site contains links to other websites. Please be aware that 
						Tuzara..com is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. We 
						encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
						privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
						identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
						collected by this Web site.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information.</b> Tuzara.com gives users 
						several options for modifying or removing their information from our database

						<b>Security.</b> Tuzara.com takes every precaution to protect our users' 
						information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
						information is protected both online and off-line.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						When our registration/order process asks users to enter sensitive information 
						(such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected

						<b>Email Choice/Opt-out.</b> Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' 
						of having information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the 
						point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive our 
						newsletter or promotional materials from our partners or affiliates may opt-out 
						of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in 
						the email.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure.&nbsp;</b><br>
						Tuzara does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other 
						people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've 
						requested, when we have your permission, or under the following 
						circumstances:&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with 
						Tuzara under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal 
						information to help Tuzara communicate with you about offers from Tuzara and 
						our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent 
						right to share this information.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or 
						exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
						prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, 
						situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, 
						violations of Tuzara's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						<b>Prospective Member Information.</b> Tuzara.com also collects prospect 
						information from our users. Our users may provide another person's information, 
						such as their friend's e-mail address, in order to send them content or 
						offerings from Tuzara.com.. The prospect's information is used for the purpose 
						for which it was submitted. Prospective members may opt-out of receiving future 
						mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.&nbsp;<br>
