<h2> TUCOWS Privacy Statement Information </h2>
<p>
TUCOWS gathers and tracks Use of the
information Sharing of the
 information Opt-out policy Unsubscribe policy How To Contact Us TUCOWS
Privacy Statement.
</p><p>
 Because we gather of information about the customers of TUCOWS and the
TUCOWS Interactive Limited
 network of sites (including but not limited to WWW.TUCOWS.COM,
WWW.EBARN.COM,
 WWW.GAMINGPLACE.COM, WWW.PDACENTRAL.COM, WWW.FREETHEMES.COM,
WWW.LINUXBERG.COM), we feel you should fully understand the terms and
conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. 
</p><p>
</p><h2> You can expect to be notified of</h2>
<p>
 The information this site gathers/tracks about you What this site does
with the information it gathers/tracks
 With whom this site shares the information it gathers/tracks This site's
opt-out policy This site's policy on
 deleting or deactivating your name from its database 
</p><p>
 Questions regarding this statement should be directed to
<a href="mailto:privacy@tucows.com">privacy@tucows.com</a>
</p><p>
</p><h2> Information TUCOWS gathers and tracks</h2>
<p>
 TUCOWS gathers two types of information about users: data that users
provide through optional, voluntary
 registration on several of our sites; and aggregated tracking information
derived mainly by tallying page
 views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to better tailor
our content to readers' needs and
 to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our
audience. Because TUCOWS
 Interactive Limited derives a portion of its revenue from advertising,
providing such aggregated
 demographic data is essential to keeping some of our service free to
users. 
</p><p>
 TUCOWS does however share the following information with the publishers of
the software titles that are
 available through the online store: 
</p><p>
 Name Address email address Telephone Fax Software purchased Software
registration code (where
 applicable) This information is provided on the contractual understanding
with each software publisher
 that it is to be used solely and exclusively for the purpose of tracking
customer software registrations and
 providing technical support as is the standard practice in the industry. 
</p><p>
 TUCOWS and TUCOWS Interactive Limited does not provide this information to
any other third parties under
 any circumstances. 
</p><p>
</p><h2> Electronic newsletters </h2>
<p>
 TUCOWS offers free electronic newsletters to users. TUCOWS Interactive
Limited gathers the email
 addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Customers may remove
themselves from any mailing list by
 following the instructions contained in every newsletter. They can also
subscribe to the newsletters at the
 time of registration. 
</p><p>
</p><h2> Surveys </h2>

 TUCOWS occasionally conducts customer surveys to better target our content
&amp; product inventory to our
 audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in
these surveys with our
 advertisers and partners. We never share any information about specific
individuals with any third party
 except as noted previously. Contests and sweepstakes 
<p>
 TUCOWS offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain
personal information. These contests
 and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States and
Canadian federal and state laws.
 The full rules and all information about such contests are clearly posted
during such events. Information
 gathered is used only to verify user identity and to contact winners
and/or prize recipients except when
 specifically noted otherwise. Again, we do not share information about
specific individuals with any third
 party except as noted previously. 
</p><p>
</p><h2>Usage tracking </h2>
<p>
 TUCOWS tracks user traffic patterns throughout TUCOWS and
this information is correlated with data
 about individual users. Overall usage statistics according to a user's
domain name, browser type, and
 MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information
contained in every user's
 browser) are also broken down. 
</p><p>
 TUCOWS also tracks and catalogs the search terms that
customers enter into our search tools, but this
 tracking is never associated with individual users. 
</p><p>
</p><h2> Cookies </h2>
<p>
 A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard
drive when you visit them. A cookie
 file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track
the pages you've visited. But the
 only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply
yourself. A cookie can't read
 data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. TUCOWS
uses cookies to track the items
 you add to your shopping card and to enforce security rules regarding
software that you download. 
</p><p>
 If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will
receive the warning message
 with each cookie. 
</p><p>
 You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You need to
have cookies turned on to
 purchase software through eBarn. 
</p><p>
</p><h2> Use of the information</h2>
<p>
 TUCOWS uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance
their experience in our network of
 sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the
sites or to better prepare future
 content based on the interests of our users. 
</p><p>
 As stated above, TUCOWS Interactive Limited uses information that users
voluntarily provide in order to
 send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in
polls and message boards. We send
 out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly,
depending on the newsletter), and
 occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be
particularly interested in
 something we are doing. TUCOWS Interactive Limited never shares newsletter
mailing lists with any third
 parties, including advertisers or partners. 
</p><p>
 When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites
users like and don't like based on
 traffic to those areas. TUCOWS Interactive Limited does not track what
individual users read, but rather
 how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a
better service for you. 
</p><p>
 We track search terms entered in our search function as one of many
measures of what interests our users.
 But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. 
</p><p>
 TUCOWS Interactive Limited creates aggregrate reports on user demographics
and traffic patterns for
 advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more
effectively, and allows our users to
 receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. TUCOWS
Interactive Limited never shares
 individual personal information with anyone, so an advertiser will never
know that a specific user clicked
 their ad. 
</p><p>
 Sharing of the information TUCOWS uses the above-described information to
tailor our content to suit
 your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience
demographics. We do not share
 information about individual users with any third party with the
exceptions noted previously. 
</p><p>
 Opt-out policy TUCOWS gives users options wherever necessary and
practical. Such choices include: 
</p><p>
 Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a
site Opting not to provide certain
 personal information when registering for a site or service Opting not to
participate in certain interactive
 areas, which completely alleviates the need for any information from our
users 
</p><p>
 Unsubscribe policy Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic
newsletters at any time by
 following the instructions contained at the end of each newsletter. 
</p><p>
