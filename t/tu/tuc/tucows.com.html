<h1>Tucows Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Tucows Inc. ("OpenSRS")<sup>1</sup> is dedicated to maintaining both a high standard of privacy and a high standard of data protection in all of its activities. The company must however balance its respect for the privacy interests of its customers-both its resellers and its end-users, employees and customers with its public responsibilities as a service provider. This is particularly true with respect to Tucows' obligations as an accredited registrar where the company is required to publicly present registrant contact information in the applicable WHOIS directory.</p>
  <h3>Scope</h3>
  <p>Tucows' privacy policy applies to personal information about identifiable Tucows customers that is collected, used or disclosed by Tucows. It also applies to the management of personal information in any form whether oral, electronic or written. The policy does not include a person or company's name, title, business address, telephone number or any other information that is required by a registry to be publicly available in a "WHOIS" directory.</p>
  <h3>General Application</h3>
  <p>The policy will apply to and protect all personal information collected used or disclosed by Tucows, except information that is aggregated in such a manner that it cannot be connected to a person and/or information which is publicly listed in "Whois" directory.</p>
    <p>Personal information which may fall under the policy may include but is not limited to:</p>

  </ul>
  <p>Personal information may be collected when:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A person makes any inquiries by telephone, signs a contract, registers a domain name or provides any information by email or through the Internet, inquires about his/her services, receives technical support, registers online, makes additional orders for services or when he/she makes a complaint; and/or</li>
    <li>A person visits a Tucows owned, hosted and/or controlled website including but not limited to: Tucows.com, Tucowsinc.com resellers.tucows.com or domaindirect.com (the "Websites").</li>

  <p>However, the policy <strong>does not</strong> impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure of the following information:</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>a person's name, address, telephone number and electronic address, when listed in a directory;</li>
    <li>an employee's name, title, business address (including email address) and phone and fax numbers; or</li>
    <li>information that is publicly available and is specified by law or regulation.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Guidelines for Internet/Website Users</h3>
  <p>There are additional guidelines that apply to persons who use our Websites and portals. In addition to the principles outlined above, Tucows may permit third parties to offer users with subscription and/or registration-based services through the Websites. In such circumstances, Tucows cannot be responsible for the content of any third party offerings or any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
  <p>Tucows also reminds users that voluntarily disclosed information online in discussion areas or other public areas of our Websites can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Unfortunately, such activities are beyond the control of Tucows.</p>
  <p>In some cases, users' non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Tucows' internet servers or through the use of "cookies". "Cookies" are small text files that are used by websites to: (a) recognize repeat users; (b) track usage behavior; and (c) compile aggregate data that will permit content improvements and targeted advertising. Tucows cannot control or prevent the use of cookies or any information obtained through such cookies by advertisers or third parties. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers permit you to disable the cookie feature. However, cookies may be required for the use of certain features on our Websites.</p>
  <p>Any submissions made to discussion areas or other public areas on our Websites are done so with a user's understanding that they are accessible to third parties. If comments are not intended for third parties, you are advised not to make any submissions.</p>
  <p>In any event, users can request Tucows to cease from sending advertising from Tucows or its authorized agents at any time by simply contacting us below.</p>
  <p>Tucows' policy generally and in connection with Internet use is subject to the requirements or provisions of any applicable legislation, regulations or agreements, or order of any court, or other lawful authority. Your use of our Websites is also subject to these requirements as well as Tucows' Acceptable Use Policy.</p><strong>THE PRIVACY PRINCIPLES TUCOWS FOLLOWS</strong>
  <p>There are ten principles, which form the basis of Tucows' policy. These principles are interrelated and Tucows shall adhere to them as a whole. Each principle must be read in conjunction with the accompanying commentary. The commentary in Tucows' policy may be tailored to reflect personal information issues specific to Tucows.</p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong>
  <p>To better understand our policy, Tucows has set out some basic definitions to use when reading and interpreting the principles below:</p>
  <div>
    <p><strong><em>Collection</em></strong> - the act of gathering, acquiring, recording, or obtaining personal information from any source, including third parties, by any means.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Consent</em></strong> - voluntary agreement with the collection, use and disclosure of personal information for defined purposes. Consent can be either express or implied and can be provided directly by the individual or by an authorized representative. Express consent can be given orally, electronically or in writing, but is always unequivocal and does not require any inference on the part of Tucows. Implied consent is consent that can reasonably be inferred from an individual's action or inaction. Consent will be implied when an individual or entity applies to register a domain name and agrees to the general terms and conditions imposed by both Tucows and the applicable registry.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Customer</em></strong> - an individual or entity that uses, or applies to use, Tucows' products or services, including but not limited to both resellers and registrants.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Disclosure</em></strong> - making personal information available to a third party.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Personal information</em></strong> - information about an identifiable individual that is recorded in any form, <strong>but does not include</strong> aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific customer. For a customer, such information does not include information that is aggregated in such a manner that it cannot be connected to him/her and/or information which is publicly listed in a written or online directory.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Third party</em></strong> - an individual or organization outside Tucows.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Use</em></strong> - the treatment, handling, and management of personal information by and within Tucows.</p>
  </div><strong>Principle 1 - Accountability</strong>
  <p>Tucows is responsible for personal information under its control. In response, it has designated its General Counsel as accountable for the company's compliance with the following principles.</p>
  <div>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>Responsibility for ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Tucows policy rests with the Legal Department within Tucows, which shall designate one or more persons to be accountable for compliance with the Tucows policy. Other individuals within Tucows may be delegated to act on behalf of the designated person(s) or to take responsibility for the day-to-day collection and processing of personal information. The General Counsel has been designated in order that Tucows may ensure that consumers have a resource to answer their privacy-related inquiries.</li>
      <li>Tucows shall make known, upon request, the identity of the person or persons designated to oversee Tucows' compliance with its policy.</li>
      <li>Tucows is responsible for personal information in its possession or control. Tucows shall use appropriate means to provide a comparable level of protection while information is being processed by a third party.</li>
      <li>Tucows shall implement policies and practices to give effect to these principles, including:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>Implementing procedures to protect personal information and to oversee Tucows' compliance with its policy;</li>
          <li>Establishing procedures to receive and respond to inquiries or complaints;</li>
          <li>Training and communicating to staff about Tucows' policies and practices; and</li>
          <li>Developing information to explain Tucows' policies and practices.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <strong>Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for Collection of Personal Information</strong>
  <p>Tucows shall identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>Tucows collects personal information only for the following purposes:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>To establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with customers and to provide ongoing services and offers;</li>
          <li>To understand customer needs;</li>
          <li>To develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;</li>
          <li>To manage and develop Tucows' business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; and</li>
          <li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
        </ol>
     <p>Further references to "identified purposes" mean the purposes identified in this Principle 2 - A.</p> </li>
  
    <li>Unless the purpose is implied from the nature of the service provided, Tucows shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the identified purposes to the customer or employee at or before the time personal information is collected. Upon request, persons collecting personal information shall explain these identified purposes or refer the individual to a designated person within Tucows who shall explain the purposes.</li>
    <li>Unless required by law, Tucows shall not use or disclose for any new purpose, personal information that has been collected without first identifying and documenting the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the customer.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>
  <p>The knowledge and consent of a customer is required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.</p>

<p>NOTE: In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used, or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, legal or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent.</p>

<p>When information is being collected for the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement, seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information. Seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when the individual is a minor, seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated. In addition, if we do not have a direct relationship with a customer, we may not always be able to seek consent.</p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>In obtaining consent, Tucows shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that a customer is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information collected will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer or employee. (See Principle 2-A)</li>
      <li>Generally, Tucows shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time it collects the information. However, Tucows may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.</li>
      <li>Tucows will only require customers to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition to the supply of a product or service if such collection, use or disclosure is required to fulfill the identified purposes.</li>
      <li>In determining the appropriate form of consent, Tucows shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of its customers.</li>
      <li>In general, the use of products and services by a customer constitutes implied consent for Tucows to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified purposes. For sensitive information, Tucows will obtain express consent at or before the time of collection.</li>
      <li>A customer may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. (See Principle 3-C). Customers may contact Tucows at the address below for more information regarding the implications of doing so.</li>
    </ol>

  <strong>Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information</strong>
  <p>Tucows shall limit the collection of personal information to that which is necessary for the identified purposes. Tucows shall collect personal information by fair and lawful means.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
    <li>Tucows collects personal information primarily from its customers.</li>
    <li>Tucows may also collect personal information from other sources including but not limited to credit bureaus or other third parties who represent that they have the right to disclose the information.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information</strong>
  <p>Tucows shall not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by a registry or by law. Tucows shall retain personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as required by law.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>Tucows may disclose a customer's personal information to:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

          <li>A company or individual employed by Tucows to perform functions on its behalf;</li>
          <li>Another company or person for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of any of Tucows' products or services;</li>
          <li>An agent or third party retained by Tucows in connection with Tucows' administration or the provision of Tucows' products or services;</li>

          <li>Credit grantors and reporting agencies;</li>

          <li>A third party or parties, where the customer consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required by law or emergency. Tucows reserves the right to contact persons at any time regarding account status, changes to services and other matters relevant to underlying services and/or personal information.

      <li>Tucows shall keep personal information only as long as it remains necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law. Depending on the circumstances, where personal information has been used to make a decision about a customer, Tucows shall retain, for a period of time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the customer, either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.</li>
      <li>Personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required to be retained by law shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous. In any event, Tucows shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for such information, its retention and destruction.</li>
