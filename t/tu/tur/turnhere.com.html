            <div id="Main" class="span-17 last">
                <p>Effective May 11, 2009</p>
                
                <p>TurnHere wants to be your trusted source for informative and entertaining film descriptions of cool places around the world, and we are committed to respecting your privacy rights. To protect any Personal Information that you may furnish while visiting www.turnhere.com (the "TurnHere Web site", or the "Web site"), we have created the following guidelines. The information collected on the Web site may be shared with our Partners or Service Providers, and used by them in accordance with the terms set forth in this policy.</p>
                
                <h3>Information Collected</h3>
                
                <p>While visiting the Web site we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Web site. Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, company name, phone number, street address, e-mail address and, for certain services, credit card information. On any page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment. Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy web page, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from visits such as this constitutes anonymous information. Many of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information.</li>
                    <li>Personal Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or phone number. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to provide Personal Information to TurnHere so that we may provide valuable services to you. Registering with TurnHere will also cause a cookie to be issued; this cookie allows TurnHere to "recognize" you when you are on our site to allow us to personalize our service for you.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Anonymous Information:</strong> As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data as well as any information received from third parties to Personal Information.</p>
                
                <p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  See "Third Party Advertisers."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> In order to use the basic features of this Web site, you need not register or provide any Personal Information. We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal Information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. We believe we can enhance your experience on our Web site with the information you share with us. We use Personal Information about you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Web site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Web site's content, layout, and services. We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions. While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our Web site, you will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, either by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your profile from our database. We also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes.</p>
                
                <p>We may also offer other services as a part of our Web site (e.g., weather information alerts, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your Personal Information to these parties. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Web site.</p>
                
                <p>Depending on the services you have chosen to use, some or all of your Personal Information may be used by TurnHere to provide such services. Personal Information may also be provided to intermediaries and third parties, including credit card processors, who assist TurnHere in providing you with the service you request. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, however, TurnHere will not share, rent or sell your information to third parties without your permission.</p>
                
                <p>TurnHere is the sole owner of the information collected on www.turnhere.com. TurnHere may collect Personal Information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>
                
                <h4>Send-To-A-Friend</h4>
                
                <p>If you choose to use our service to tell a friend about a film you saw on our Web site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@turnhere.com">legal@turnhere.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
                
                <h4>Special Offers and Updates </h4>
                
                <p>We will occasionally send you information on services, special deals, products and/or promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice/Opt-out."</p>
                
                <h4>Service-related Announcements</h4>
                
                <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
                
                <h4>Customer Service</h4>
                
                <p>Based upon the Personal Information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, if you have provided such information.</p>
                
                <h4>Profile </h4>
                
                <p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, or clear gifs to create a "profile" of your preferences. We may tie your Personal Information to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.</p>
                
                <h4>Bulletin Board/Blogs/Rate A Film</h4>
                
                <p>If you use a bulletin board or blog or rate a film on this site, you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
                
                <h3>COOKIES</h3>
                
                <p>What are Cookies? A cookie is a small data text file that a web site sends to your browser, which is stored on your system. The Website can only access the information from a cookie sent by the Web site. We cannot access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, through a registration system, or by entering a sweepstakes or promotion.</p>
                
                <p>Why does the Web site use cookies? We use cookies to track usage of the Web site and further personalize your experience when you are visiting the Web site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Web site best serve the users.</p>
                
                <p>What benefits do I receive from cookies? Overall, the use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Web site. The information is used to keep our Web site fresh and relevant to you the user.</p>
                
                <p>May I decline to accept a cookie? You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Web site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, if at some point we require registration to use our services, you will be required to log in each time you access the Web site. Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Web site.</p>
                
                <p>We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.

                <h3>Party Collecting the Information</h3>
                
                <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from you. The Web site may offer forums, message boards, or chat rooms as one of the services on the Web site. If you disclose Personal Information in one of these forums, this information can be viewed, collected, and used by others.

                <h3>Third Party Advertisers</h3>
                
                <p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by third-party advertising companies. Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The companies serve their ads from their own web sites, independently from TurnHere. The information that the third-party advertising companies collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable, unless you provide such information in response to an advertisement.</p>
                
                <h3>Links to Other Materials</h3>
                
                <p>Third party sites and co-branded sites linked to and from the Web site, including credit card processors, are not necessarily under our control. We shall have no responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. We do not necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which the Web site is linked. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the Web site, you do so entirely at your own risk. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.</p>
                
                <h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
                
                <p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your Personal Information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you register but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on your account.</p>
                
                <p>If you no longer wish to receive certain communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by logging into your account and changing your preferences.</p>
                
                <h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>
                
                <p>If your Personal Information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page.</p>
                
                <h3>Business Transitions</h3>
                
                <p>In the event TurnHere goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets as well as in the event of a bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or receivership, your Personal Information may be disclosed and will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information.</p>
                
                <h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
                
                <p>We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
                
                <h3>Your Privacy Rights Regarding Third Party Sharing</h3>
                
                <p>To help service your requests, we may provide certain Personal Information to third parties who may use this information for their own purposes, including sending advertising to you. If you would prefer to opt out of this usage of your Personal Information, you may do so by updating your member information page and opting out of such usage. To access your member information, you must first log in to www.turnhere.com. However, we will still use and provide to third parties your Personal Information to fulfill your request.</p>
                
                <h3>Changes in this Privacy Policy</h3>
                
                <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. </p>
                
                <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
                
                <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

                <h3>Security</h3>
