<p>Last updated May 1, 2005</p>
<p>This Web site is operated by, and information collected from this site is collected by, Turbine, Inc. (“Turbine,” the “Company” or “we”).</p>
<p>Turbine respects the privacy of its online visitors and users of its products and services.  Turbine recognizes the importance of protecting certain information collected from users and has adopted this privacy policy that guides how Turbine gathers, stores, and uses information provided from users through the Turbine products and online sites as described below. </p>
<p>This policy is current as of its last revision date indicated above.  However, please note that this policy may be amended from time to time to reflect changes and additions to the privacy policy. Please check back for the most current version before relying on any of the provisions in this privacy policy.  Your continued use of the Turbine products and online sites will constitute your acceptance of any and all changes made to the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to www.turbinegames.com, www.turbine.com, www.ddo.com, www.middle-earthonline.com, ac.turbine.com, ac2.turbine.com and other web sites owned, operated, licensed or controlled by Turbine (including the related online products and services, the “Turbine Sites”), unless such sites contain or links to a separate privacy policy.</p>

<p><span class="sectionTitle">Collection and Use of Information</span><br>
By using the Turbine Sites, users agree that Turbine may share with other parties aggregate information and non-identifiable information gathered by Turbine in the course of the continuing use of Turbine Sites.  “Aggregate information” is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user.  “Non-identifiable information” is information about a user that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users but not in a form that personally identifies contact and/or billing information for any user, or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such communication.  Aggregate information or non-identifiable information may be used to improve the Turbine Sites, for internal marketing studies, or simply to collect demographic information about Turbine’s users. </p>
<p>Turbine may use customer contact information provided by users to send information about (i) Turbine and the products, services and/or sites for which you subscribed or otherwise used or accessed, including news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, and (ii) only if the users agree to receive such communications, for unrelated products or services.  Except in the cases described below, Turbine will not share personally identifiable information with any third-party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in advance.  “Personally identifiable information” is information that permits a recipient to identify you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, credit card information.  While Turbine collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis for the use of the Turbine Sites, Turbine’s collection of personally identifiable information may be a requirement for access to certain parts of the Turbine Sites and related products or services.  We may collect personally identifiable information from you when you (a) make an online purchase from the Turbine Sites, (b) register to become a member or user of our services, (c) voluntarily provide it when you use the Turbine Site(s), (d) disclose it in a public area of the Turbine Site(s) or (e) provide it when you communicate with us.  If you make an online purchase or register to become a member or user of our services through the Turbine Sites, we may use the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with such purchase for shipping and billing purposes, and to administer and manage your account and provide promotional updates regarding such products or services as contemplated above.</p>
<p>Turbine allows for the online submission of resumes via the Turbine Sites.  Please note that the information (including personal information) collected from a resume is not subject to this privacy policy.  However, we want to assure you that information obtained from your resume will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating your submission for a job with Turbine.</p>
<p>We may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service or security issues related to a product or service you requested, confirming you requested a product or service or providing periodic updates or information relating to the product or service you requested.  For so long as you are subscribed to a service, you will not be able to choose to unsubscribe from these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.</p>
<p>When our third-party contractors or partners collect and/or have access to the personally identifiable information you provide when requesting such services from Turbine, we require that they adhere to our stated privacy policies and protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable information they collect or have access to in the course of its engagement by Turbine.</p>
<p>Turbine may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, providing billing and collection services, and processing event registration.  We will only provide these companies the information reasonably required to perform the service, and they will be prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.  </p>
<p>Also, in certain cases, your personally identifiable information may be collected directly by our authorized distributors, sublicensees or subcontractors in connection with certain products or services made available through web sites operated by such companies.  In these cases, the privacy policies of such companies will apply rather than Turbine’s policy.  If providing the information is a requirement of usage, the user may elect to decline to use that particular product or service.  </p>
<p>Turbine may elect to share personally identifiable information of users with qualified third-party partners for marketing or other similar purposes but only if the users agree to share such information.
