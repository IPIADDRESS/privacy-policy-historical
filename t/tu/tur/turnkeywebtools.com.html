			of our related services therein.</p>

			<strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong><br> 
			
			<p>When visiting the our web site, you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you voluntarily choose 
			to disclose that is collected on an individual basis, and Web site use information gathered on a collective basis as you and 
			others browse our Web site.</p>
			
			<strong>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong><br> 
			
			<p><em>Registration Information</em><br>
			You will provide us information about yourself, your firm or company, and your practices when you register to be a user of our 
			services, register for certain services, or register for email newsletters and alerts.</p>
			
			<p><em>Email Information</em><br>
			If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email 
			address and our responses. If you use our "Email this page" feature to send a copy of that page to someone else, your email 
			address will appear as the sender of the email. Both your email address and the recipient's email address will not be used for 
			any other purpose.</p>
			
			<strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong><br>
			
			<p>Generally, we use personal information for purposes of managing and expanding our business activities, providing customer 
			service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also 
			use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think 
			you will find valuable.</p>
			
			<strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
			
			<p>We allow you the choice to opt-out of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site, when we ask 
			for the information.</p>
			
			<p>Until you explicitly opt-in for the first time we consider you in the opt-out category. We always notify our customers when 
			their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether 
			or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>
			
			<p>If you do not wish to receive any promotional or marketing e-mails and/or surface mail marketing letters, you may opt-out of 
			receiving those communications by using the opt-out mechanism on the User Account Settings Web page, or by sending an e-mail with 
			the subject line "Unsubscribe" to  or e-mail address - see above.</p>
			
			<strong>What Are Cookies?</strong><br>
			
			<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that 
			site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for 
			cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) 
			your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. </p>
			
			<strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong><br>
			
			<p>As you visit our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other customers. In some cases, we also use cookies to 
			prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security.</p>
			
			<p>Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and 
			which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our 
			customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that 
			you provided to us in your cookies.</p>
			
			<strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong><br> 
			
			<p>We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information 
			including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we 
			think will be of interest to you.</p>
			
			<p>In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined 
			that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party.</p>
			
			<p>We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. 
			In connection with these offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information 
			for use in connection with business activities.</p>
			
			<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of 
			the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, 
			mergers, or any dissolution.</p>

			Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by 
			email. Some of the information you may enter on our Web site may be transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer SSL, 128 bit encryption 
			services. Pages utilizing this technology will have URLs that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please contact  if you have any questions
