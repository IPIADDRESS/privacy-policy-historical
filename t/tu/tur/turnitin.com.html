	                <ol>
	                  <li>To verify the identity of a registrant in relation to his or her authority to register in connection with a specific academic institution.</li>
	                  <li>To obtain the most complete contact information for administration of the registrant's account.</li>
	                  <li>To inform the registrant of changes in Turnitin's functionality, Turnitin's auxiliary services, and Turnitin's promotions.</li>
	                </ol>

	                <h4>Trial</h4>
	                <p>Personal information is requested for trial use of our service for the following purposes:</p>
	                <ol>
	                  <li>To inform the trial user of changes in Turnitin's functionality, Turnitin's auxiliary services, and Turnitin's promotions.</li>
	                  <li>To request the trial user's evaluation and recommendations for the Turnitin service.</li>
	                </ol>

	                <h4>Paper Submission</h4>
	                <p>Personal information is requested for access to our paper submission web pages for the following purposes:</p>

	                  <li>To identify the individual connected to any uploaded text.</li>
	                  <li>To provide receipt and confirmation of successful text uploads.</li>
	                </ol>

	                <p>The type of information we request is connected to the above-noted purposes.  For example, we collect personal contact information such as name, physical address, telephone number, and email address for a registered user in order to facilitate use of the Turnitin service and facilitate customer relations.  In addition to the specific uses noted above, Turnitin also uses your personally identifiable information to process your requests and transactions.</p>
	                <p>Turnitin may also use your personally identifiable information to prevent harm or injury, to prevent fraud, to protect our legal interests, to comply with or respond to legal process, and to comply with applicable laws.</p>
	                <p>If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, Turnitin will not use your personal information for any other purpose that those set forth above.</p> 
	                <p>If you are thirteen (13) years of age or older, Turnitin may also use your personal information to offer or furnish additional products and services and to personalize the types of information you receive from Turnitin.</p>

This approval includes, but is not limited to, one registered user allowing Turnitin to provide his or her contact information to another registered user for document source analysis tracking. For example, if material uploaded to our database matches material from a later upload, contact information related to the former is given to the registered user associated with the latter upload for follow-up if the former specifically consents.  As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets, or Turnitin might be acquired by another company. In any of those circumstances, personal information in our databases may be included among the transferred assets, except that personal information for users who are under thirteen (13) years of age will not be considered an asset for sale or transfer.</p>
	                <p>We use non-personally identifiable information, such as IP address, to assess trends in the use of our Site or purchases of products or services, facilitate market research and statistical studies, develop content and functionality that helps us serve our customers' needs, and improve the service and products we provide.</p>

	                <h3>2. Cookies</h3>
	                <p>When you visit the Site, we may place a "cookie," a small computer file containing information about the user, on your computer to help us recognize and serve you better when you return. A cookie is in no way linked to personally identifiable information.  Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our Site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our Site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Site (e.g., advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

	                <p>If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, except in connection with the educational purposes for which it was originally collected, no personally identifiable information will be provided to a third party. If we transfer personally identifiable information to a third party that is acting as our agent, we will require that the third party agree to confidentiality requirements.</p>

	                <h3>5. Access or Change Your Personal Information</h3>
	                <p>You can access, correct, amend, or delete the personal information that you have provided us at any time via this Site by following these steps:</p>

	                <p>We will take reasonable steps to see that the personal information in our systems is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>

	                <h3>9. Enforcement</h3>
