			<h3>This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 15, 2008</h3>
						
				<p>Turn Inc. ("Turn") provides advertisers and
				publishers ("Business Partners") access to a set of technologies and
				processes designed to display advertisements to consumers viewing a publisher's
				website(s) (the "Turn Ads").</p>
				
				<p>This Privacy Policy describes Turn's privacy practices as
				they pertain to (i) visitors to our website located at www.turn.com (our
				"Site"), and (ii) our targeted advertising technology service
				("Technology"). If you'd like to understand our privacy practices as they
				pertain to information collected from and about our Business Partners, please 
				click <a href="/corp/about/partner-privacy-policy.jsp">here</a>.</p>
				
				<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please
				feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@turn.com">privacy@turn.com</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Turn is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and is in compliance
				with the NAI's Self-Regulatory Principles.</p>
				
				<p><b>1. Site Privacy Policy</b></p>
				
				<p>The Site is intended primarily to offer information about
				Turn and the services we provide. </p>
				
				<p><u>Information Collected via the Site</u></p>
				
				<p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from
				the Site when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that can
				be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but
				is not limited to: name, postal address, telephone number, or email address.
				For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by
				completing an online form on this Site. We use this information only to contact
				you to respond to your inquiry. Once collected, we will store your PII for a
				reasonable time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is
				usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.</p>
				
				<p>We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information
				(Non-PII) via the Site. Non-PII cannot be used to contact any single person or
				entity and may include your IP address, pages viewed on this Site, browser
				type, Internet Service Provider, the time/date of your visit to this Site, and
				your computer's operating system (e.g., Windows XP). Turn uses this information
				for internal purposes such as to administer the Site, improve and customize the
				Site, help Turn understand and analyze how the Site is being used and to track
				aggregate Site usage.</p>
				
				<p><u>Cookies and Web Beacons</u></p>
				
				<p>We use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage this Site.
				Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. We
				also use persistent cookies on this Site in order to help us manage the opt-out
				process for our Technology. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for
				an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following
				directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Web beacons (also
				known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs") are small strings of code that provide a
				method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for
				the purpose of transferring data. For more information about cookies and web
				beacons please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/</a>.</p>
				
				<p><u>Third Party Websites</u></p>
				
				<p>The Site may contain links to other websites. Such websites
				may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. Turn is not responsible for
				the privacy practices, policies or content of such other websites. Turn
				encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting
				with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website.
				Turn has no control over the use of information by third party websites, and
				you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any PII to those
				websites.</p>
				
				<p><u>Updating / Deleting your PII</u></p>
				
				<p>If you'd like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any
				PII that you have provided to us on this Site, please send your request to us
				at <a href="mailto:privacy@turn.com">privacy@turn.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable period
				of time after receipt.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>2. Technology Privacy Policy</b></p>
				
				<p>Turn is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and is in compliance
				with the NAI's Self-Regulatory Principles.</p>

				<p><u>Overview of Turn's Technology</u></p>
				
				<p>Our Technology collects information about the website(s)
				that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online. You may
				encounter our Technology: when Turn or one of our Business Partners purchase online
				advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when one of our Business Partners
				places one of our web beacons on its website, which you visit.</p>
				
				<p>We use the information collected by our Technology in order
				to help make the Turn Ads you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and
				reporting purposes.</p>
				
				<p><u>What information is collected?</u></p>
				
				<p>Turn does not collect PII via our Technology. Our Technology
				does collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the
				Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many Business Partner web pages
				have been viewed, search terms entered on Business Partner websites, referring/exit
				pages, and the date and time a Turn Ad was viewed.</p>
				
				<p>Turn uses this information to analyze trends, identify the
				audience most likely to respond to an advertisement and to tailor advertisement
				placement for our Business Partners accordingly. We also may aggregate this
				information and share it with Turn's affiliates, advertisers, employees,
				customers and Business Partners.</p>
				
				<p><u>Cookies and Web Beacons</u></p>
				
				<p>Turn uses cookies and web beacons in connection with our
				Technology. Cookies help Turn better understand the effectiveness of a Turn Ad
				(for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, selectand
				interact with a Turn Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and
				context in which you view a Turn Ad). Turn's cookies also help control the
				number of times you view a Turn Ad. Most Internet browsers automatically accept
				cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop
				accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
				visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy the
				full functionality of many of the websites you visit.</p>
				
				<p>Turn also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to
				analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows Turn to record that
				someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that
				the website may choose to include with the beacon.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><u>Third Party Links and Websites</u></p>
				
				<p>Turn Ads may contain links to other websites, including
				those of our Business Partners. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data
				collection tools. Turn is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies
				or the content of such websites. Turn encourages everyone to read the posted
				privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the
				privacy practices of that website. Turn has no control over the use of
				anyinformation by third party websites, and you should exercise caution when
				deciding to disclose any PII. Similarly, Turn does not have access to, or
				control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed
				on any advertisement by a third-party, including those of our Business Partners, and
				this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection
				tools by any third party.</p>
				
				<p><u>Storage of Non-PII</u></p>
				
				<p>We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to
				90 days in order to ensure that our Technology is functioning properly. After 90
				days, we render this information anonymous and store it for up to three years.</p>
				
				<p><b>Controlling the use of your information</b></p>
				
				<p><u>Opting out</u></p>
				
				<p>If you'd like to opt-out from having Turn collect your
				Non-PII in connection with our Technology, please 
				<a href="/corp/about/opt-out.jsp">click here to opt out</a>.
				When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out
				cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor Turn Ads to your
				interests. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies,
				or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew
				your opt-out choice.</p>
				
				<p><u>Deleting your PII</u></p>
				
				<p>Although we don't collect PII via our Technology, if you'd
				like us to update, correct, delete or deactivate any PII that you have provided
				to us on the Website, please send your request to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@turn.com">privacy@turn.com</a> and we
				will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>3. General:</b></p>
				
				<p><u>Information Security</u></p>
				
				<p>The security of your information is important to us. We have
				implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our
				care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is
				not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the
				Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,
				while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
				information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
				
				<p>If you have any questions about our security practices,
				please send an email to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@turn.com">privacy@turn.com</a>.</p>
				
				<p><u>Information Relating to Children</u></p>
				
				<p>Our products and services are designed for those 18 years of
				age and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 18.
				If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under 18, we will
				use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.</p>
				
				<p><u>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</u></p>
				
				<p>We do not collect PII via our Technology, and we do not
				sell, rent or share PII collected on the Website with non-affiliated third
				parties without your consent. We may, however, share your PII with trusted
				third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party
				contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes
				other than performing services for us.</p>
				
				<p>We may share Non-PII collected via our Technology with Web
				Partners. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our Technology
				with Non-PII collected from Business Partners. This information cannot be used to
				contact or identify any person individually.</p>
				
				<p>We may disclose your information to third parties when we
				reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to
				investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited
				activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving
				potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII
				collected via the Site, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate
				merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p>
				
				<p><u>Changes to this Privacy Policy</u></p>
				
				<p>This privacy policy is subject to change. If we make any
				material or substantive changes in the way that we use the PII collected
				through this Website, we will post a clear and conspicuous notice of those
				changes on the Website and in this privacy policy.</p>
				
				<p><u>Contact Information</u></p>
				
				<p>For questions or concerns relating to privacy, please send
				us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@turn.com">privacy@turn.com</a>. Alternatively, you may contact us at: Privacy
				Officer, Turn Inc., 1600 Seaport Boulevard, Suite 300, Redwood City, CA 94063.</p>
