					<h1 style="text-align: center;">TURTLE ROCK STUDIOS, INC. PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Last </i><i>updated February 10, 2014</i><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Privacy Commitment</span></b></p>
<p>Turtle Rock Studios, Inc. (“<b><i>TRS,</i></b>” “<b><i>we,</i></b>” “<b><i>us</i></b>” or “<b><i>our</i></b>”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the turtlerockstudios.com website (the “<b><i>Site</i></b>”) (we refer to the Site, the services made available through the Site, collectively, as the “<b><i>TRS Services</i></b>”).&nbsp; As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of TRS Services of how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site.&nbsp; By visiting or browsing the Site(s) or using the TRS Services, you consent to TRS’s collection, use, storage, deletion, transfer to the United States, and disclosure of personal information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site(s) and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site(s) which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.</p>
<p>This policy answers the following questions:</p>
<p>- &nbsp; What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">- &nbsp; Will we share your personal information with third parties?</span></p>
<p>- &nbsp; What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</p>
<p>- &nbsp; What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</p>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Do We Collect About You</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Do We Use It</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">?</span></strong></h3>
<p><i>Types of Information We Collect</i></p>
<p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. &nbsp;The Site and TRS Services may collect personal information from you including your email address, name and cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not want to disclose certain personal information to us, you will not be able to access certain aspects of the TRS Services, such as forums.</p>
<p>Personal information is collected from you when you create an account on the Site; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in Site feedback, questionnaires, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions or receive customer or technical support.</p>
<p>To create an account to use the TRS Services, we will require you to provide certain information to create your account, including your email address, user name and password.</p>
<p>If you sign up to the TRS Services through Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, we may also collect personally identifiable information from these social networking sites and database services, including the Facebook Groups that you belong to.</p>
<p><i>How We Use Your Personal Information</i></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newsletters</span>. &nbsp;TRS may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send you commercial or marketing messages including, without limitation, newsletters, promotions, updates, special offers, and email communications about our products or services.&nbsp; We will also use your email address to contact you regarding any customer or technical support issues.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account Login</span>. The personal information you provide will allow you to log in to the Site and TRS Services.</p>
<p>We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the TRS Services. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the TRS Services. &nbsp;We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.</p>
<p><i>De-Personalizing Your Information</i></p>
<p>We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.&nbsp; This process is known as de-personalizing your information.&nbsp; You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect on the Site and TRS Services (the “<b><i>Analytical Data</i></b>”). &nbsp;We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties.</p>
<p><i>Cookies</i><i> and other Technical Information</i><i></i></p>
<p>“Cookies” are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on the visitor’s hard drive. &nbsp;Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient and to enhance your experience with the Site. &nbsp;For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Site by, for instance, tailoring content to you. &nbsp;A user may configure his or her web browsers to accept or reject or delete the cookies, or notify the user when a cookie is being set.</p>
<p>We may collect other technical information from users of the Site, including their IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and geolocational information.</p>
<p><i>Web Beacons</i></p>
<p>We employ third party tracking utility software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. &nbsp;In short, clear gifs enable two websites to share information with one another.&nbsp; We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><i>Tracking Pixel</i></p>
<p>A tracking “pixel” is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and allows for the collection of information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel. The Company uses third party ad servers to support tracking pixels and cookies.</p>
<p><i>Google Analytics</i></p>
<p>Our Site uses Google Analytics to help us learn about who visits our site and what pages are being viewed.</p>
<p><i>Social Media Features </i></p>
<p>Our Site interfaces with social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and others.&nbsp; If you choose to log in to your account on the Site through those social media sites, then TRS may access your information on those sites and import, use, and share your “friends” list or contacts from those sites.&nbsp; If you choose to “like” or share personal information through those services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. &nbsp;Those social media sites may collect your IP address or set cookies.&nbsp; If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect and view your personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children’s Privacy</span></h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13, allow them to create accounts, sign up for newsletters, use the TRS Services, or browse the Site. &nbsp;We take children’s privacy seriously and encourage parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times. &nbsp;We urge parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without parental permission, when on-line.&nbsp; If you have any concerns about your child’s personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@turtlerockstudios.com">legal@turtlerockstudios.com</a>.</p>
<h3><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Share Your Personal </span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information</span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> With Third Parties</span></b><b></b></h3>
<p>We will share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:</p>
<p><i>- &nbsp; Protection of rights.</i>&nbsp; We will share personal information if we have a good faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Site or TRS Services, or (iii) such action is appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of TRS, its employees, clients, or users of the Site.</p>
<p><i>- &nbsp; Asset transfers.&nbsp; </i>If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of TRS’s assets or a line of business, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Site and TRS Services, could be included in the transferred assets. &nbsp;Should such an event occur, TRS will use reasonable means to notify you through a prominent notice on the Site.</p>
<p><i>- &nbsp; Service Providers</i>. We may share your personal information with third party vendors or service providers that we engage for the purpose of fulfilling product orders or processing information on our and your behalf. &nbsp;For example, we may partner with other companies to process payments for the Site. &nbsp;Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process consumer surveys, fulfill prizes, or to process, analyze, and/or store data, including, but not limited to, Analytical Data. While providing services for us, these companies may access your personal information. &nbsp;To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p><i>Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties</i></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site.&nbsp; Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as TRS.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you click on a third party logo or URL displayed on our Site which links you to a different website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.&nbsp; If you cannot find their privacy policy, then you should contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.&nbsp; We are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information.</p>
<h3><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What </span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choices Do You Have About the Collection and Use of Your Personal Information?</span></b></h3>
<p>When you provide us with personal information, you consent to our collecting, using, and sharing it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
<p><i>Control of Your Information</i></p>
<p>TRS allows you to control the way we use personally identifying information that we might obtain.&nbsp; At the time you provide personal information, TRS may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services.&nbsp; In addition, many of the “mailings” TRS may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.&nbsp; Lastly, you may “opt-out” of certain third-party sharing by requesting the deletion of your personal information.</p>
<p><i>Data Retention</i></p>
<p>TRS retains the collected data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. &nbsp;Thereafter, TRS deletes all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe. &nbsp;TRS does not verify the correctness of personal data.</p>
<p>Please note that some data may be retained if necessary to resolve disputes, enforce TRS’s terms of service, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of the Site or TRS Services.</p>
<p><i>How to Opt-out, Correct or Delete Your Data</i></p>
<p>Any individual who seeks access, or who seeks to opt-out of certain third party sharing, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to the below email or physical address. &nbsp;If, for any reason, you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to request that we delete such personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:delete-account@turtlerockstudios.com">delete-account@turtlerockstudios.com</a>, or by mail at Turtle Rock Studios, Inc., ATTN: PRIVACY OPT-OUT, One Spectrum Pointe Drive, Suite 100, Lake Forest, California 92630.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information, and will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Governing Law</span></b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by, and construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions.</p>
<p><i>Mediation</i></p>
<p>If you are a resident of a country outside the European Union, you agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you and the Company will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties.&nbsp; You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Orange County, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute.&nbsp; Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.</p>
<p><i>Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union</i></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you may report your claim to the European Union Data Protection Authorities located in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection – Safe Harbor</span></b></p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notification of Changes</span></b></p>
