<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
<p>Turtle Rock Studios respects the privacy of its online visitors and users of its products. Turtle Rock Studios recognizes the importance of protecting any information collected from users and has adopted this privacy policy that guides how Turtle Rock Studios gathers, stores, and uses information from the use of Turtle Rock Studios products and online sites by users.</p>

<p>This policy is current as of its last revision date. However, please note that this policy may be amended from time to time to reflect changes and additions to the privacy policy. Please check back for the most current version before relying on any of the provisions in this privacy policy.</p>

<h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
<p>By using Turtle Rock Studios's online sites and products, users agree that Turtle Rock Studios may collect aggregate information, individual information, and personally identifiable information, as defined below. Turtle Rock Studios may share aggregate information and individual information with other parties. Turtle Rock Studios shall not share personally identifiable information with other parties, except as described in the policy below.</p>

<p>"Aggregate information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user.</p>

<p>"Individual information" is information about a user that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users but not in a form that personally identifies any user or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such communication. This information may be used to improve Turtle Rock Studios's products and online sites, for internal marketing studies, or simply to collect demographic information about Turtle Rock Studios's users.</p>

<p>Turtle Rock Studios may use customer contact information provided by users to send information about Turtle Rock Studios, including news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, but only if the users agree to receive such communications. Except in the cases described below, Turtle Rock Studios will not share personally identifiable information with any third party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in advance. "Personally identifiable information" consists of a user's name, email address, physical address, or other data about the user that enables the recipient to personally identify the user. While Turtle Rock Studios collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis, for certain products and online sites, Turtle Rock Studios's collection of personally identifiable information may be a requirement for access to the product or site. Personally identifiable information will be processed and stored by Turtle Rock Studios in databases situated in the United States. Turtle Rock Studios may allow third parties performing services under contract with Turtle Rock Studios to access stored information but such access shall only be to the extent necessary to provide those services. In those instances, the third party will be bound by the terms of this privacy policy. Turtle Rock Studios has no obligation to keep the privacy of personally identifiable information that a user makes available to other users via other Turtle Rock Studios software, such as in multiplayer or other public functions.</p>

<p>Personally identifiable information protected under this privacy policy and collected from users may be done in conjunction with associates under agreement with Turtle Rock Studios. If an associate of Turtle Rock Studios is collecting such personally identifiable information within one of our products or online sites, Turtle Rock Studios will make users aware of this at the time the information is gathered. For example, product registration data for Half-Life is collected by Sierra Entertainment. If a user does not want to provide this information, the user may choose to opt out of providing this information. Additionally, if providing the information is a requirement of usage, the user may decline to use that particular service or product. When possible, Turtle Rock Studios will make a reasonable effort to direct users to the privacy polices of these associates. Turtle Rock Studios's privacy policy does not extend to associates of Turtle Rock Studios.</p>

<p>Furthermore, external websites and companies with links to and from Turtle Rock Studios's online sites and products may collect personal information about users. Turtle Rock Studios's privacy policy does not extend to these external websites and companies. Please refer directly to these companies and websites regarding their privacy policies.</p>

<p>Turtle Rock Studios may release personally identifiable information to comply with court orders or laws that require us to disclose such information</p>

<h4>Children Under The Age of 13</h4>
<p>Turtle Rock Studios will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any person age 12 and under. Turtle Rock Studios encourages parents to instruct their children to never give out personal information when online. Parents who are concerned about the transfer of personal information from their children may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@turtlerockstudios.com">privacy@turtlerockstudios.com</a> to obtain a record of any information held by Turtle Rock Studios and have it removed at their request.</p>

<h4>Cookies and Other Information on a User's Machine</h4>
<p>Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to a user's hard drive to customize a person's usage of a product or online site, keep records of a user's access to an online site or product, or store information needed by the user on a regular basis. Use of cookies is typically associated with websites. Turtle Rock Studios does use cookies on their websites. This cookie allows you to move from page to page without having to sign in again on each page. Similarly, if you enter information during your session, such as age verification data, this will be stored as a cookie and you will not have to re-enter such information during that session.</p>

<p>Turtle Rock Studios also stores information on a user's hard drive that is used in conjunction with online play of Turtle Rock Studios products. This includes a unique authorization key or CD-Key that is either entered by the user or downloaded automatically during product registration. This authorization key is used to identify a user as valid and allow access to Turtle Rock Studios's products. Turtle Rock Studios software automatically generates and submits to Turtle Rock Studios bug reports upon a crash or other fault in the Turtle Rock Studios software. This automatically generated bug report information may include information about other software or hardware on a user's system. Turtle Rock Studios does not associate and store the automatically generated bug report information with personally identifiable information. Any bug reporting information manually submitted by users (e.g. through Turtle Rock Studios's Bug Reporter form) is associated and stored with personally identifiable information. Users should also be aware that game play information disclosed during multiplayer game play (e.g. player name and current player statistics) is public information and may be displayed to other users.</p>

<h4>Chat Forums, Etc.</h4>
<p>From time to time, Turtle Rock Studios's online products may provide chat forums, bulletin boards, or instant messaging tools to users. Any information that is disclosed in chat forums or bulletin boards is public information, and users who message one another may not know each other personally. Users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in such chat forums.</p>

<h4>Choice/Opt-out</h4>
<p>Turtle Rock Studios gives users the option of discontinuing receipt of promotional email communications from Turtle Rock Studios. Instructions for discontinuing receipt of promotional email communications from Turtle Rock Studios will be provided in such subsequent email communications to users.</p>

<h4>Storage and Security of Information</h4>
<p>Personally identifiable information will be processed and stored by Turtle Rock Studios in databases hosted in the United States. Turtle Rock Studios has taken reasonable steps to protect the information users share with us, including, but not limited to, setup of processes, equipment and software to avoid unauthorized access or disclosure of this information.</p>

<h4>Corrections, Updates and Removal of Information</h4>
<p>If you are concerned about the accuracy of personal information maintained by Turtle Rock Studios or would like your personal information removed from Turtle Rock Studios's records, please contact us by emailing <a class="PrivacyEmail" href="mailto:privacy@turtlerockstudios.com">privacy@turtlerockstudios.com</a> for review, update, or removal of personal information.</p>
