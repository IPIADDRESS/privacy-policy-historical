            <p>We protect the confidentiality of your personal information by 
              using industry-recognized security safeguards, such as firewalls, 
              coupled with carefully developed security procedures that protect 
              your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. When 
              we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, we

            <p>Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information. 
              Using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict 
              access to personal information to those employees and agents for 
              business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external 
              resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.</p>
            <p class="subhead1">We tell you how we intend to use your information.</p>
            <p>When we ask you for information, we tell you, or it will be clear, 
              what we need to fulfill your request and how we will use it.</p>
			  <ul>
			  <li>We do not make your tax return information available to anyone, including anyone at Intuit, for any marketing purpose.</li>
			  <li>We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.</li>
			  <li>We do not share your personal information with anyone outside of Intuit for their marketing use.</li></ul>
			  
            <p class="subhead1">This site collects and uses your information as 
              follows:</p>
            <p><strong>Preparation and Electronic Filing of Tax Returns.</strong> 
              You may use the TurboTax<sup>®</sup> for the Web<sup>sm</sup> federal and 
              TurboTax for the Web state products to assist you with the online 
              preparation and electronic filing of your tax return (referred to 
              as the “TurboTax for the Web products”). “Tax 
              return information” is information you provide that is used 
              to prepare a tax return with the TurboTax for the Web products.</p>
            <p>Intuit uses tax return information only in accordance with applicable laws 
              to provide the online tax preparation, electronic filing or other 
              services you have requested. Intuit does not disclose tax return 
              information to third parties, nor does it use tax return information 
              to market Intuit or third parties’ products and services, 
              except as required by law or to provide you with the products or 
              services that you have specifically requested or consented to.</p>
            <p>To detect fraud in tax information transmitted via the Internet, the Internal 
              Revenue Service (IRS) requires us to provide them, in connection 
              with the electronic filing of tax returns, the Internet Protocol 
              (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated. We 
              are also required to notify the IRS whether the e-mail address of 
              the person electronically filing the return has been collected.</p>
			  <p>We are an approved transmitter of electronically filed federal and state income tax returns.  Electronically filed tax returns are encrypted during transmission to us. When we transmit your tax return, we use the most secure transmission technology supported by the IRS and by state tax filing agencies.  To provide customer technical support when troubleshooting e-filing related problems, such as acknowledgements or rejected returns, we may ask you to resubmit your tax return to us.</p>
            <p><strong>Refund Processing.</strong> You can choose to apply for 
              refund processing and, upon approval, use your tax refund to pay 
              for your electronic filing. This service is offered by our partner, 
              Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust (“SBBT”). When you apply 
              for refund processing, you are authorizing Intuit to disclose your 
              customer information and tax return to SBBT. You should consult 
              the applicable refund processing application to understand how SBBT 
              will use this information, including the processing and underwriting 
              of your application and detecting, preventing and reporting fraud.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment Information.</strong> When you purchase the TurboTax 
              for the Web products, and those of our partners, for example, Professional 
              Tax Review and Audit Defense, Intuit collects personally identifiable 
              information to process your order. We request your credit card information, 
              which Intuit uses solely to process your payment. We request certain 
              contact information, including your name, company name (if applicable), 
              address, phone numbers and e-mail address.</p>
            <p>When you purchase the TurboTax for the Web products, Intuit may 
              use your contact information to contact you with product and service 
              updates, significant tax law changes, or special offers that may 
              interest you. If you prefer not to be contacted, or want to specify 
              your contact preferences, please <a href="https://privacy.intuit.com/cpi/do/preferences?dialog=1&amp;hidenav=1&amp;p_sourceid=252">click 
              here</a>, or write to us at Intuit Inc., Customer Communications, 
              2800 East Commerce Center Place, Tucson, AZ 85706. If you opt out 
              of receiving these communications, you will still receive service 
              messages (such as order confirmation), subscription renewal notices, 
              legally mandated notices, and critical messages that relate to the 
              ability to use your software or services.</p>
            <p> <strong>Instant Data Entry.</strong> Instant Data Entry allows 
              you to retrieve and enter tax information automatically from sources 
              such as participating employers, brokerages, payroll companies, 
              mortgage companies, and mutual fund companies, directly onto the 
              correct forms in the TurboTax for the Web products. When you download 
              information from such tax data providers, you will be required to 
              enter authentication information, such as your user name, account 
              number and/or password. The TurboTax for the Web products use this 
              information solely for the purpose of providing authentication to 
              the tax data provider.</p>
            <p> <strong>Credit Card Payments to IRS.</strong> If you would like 
              to pay your federal balance due by credit card, the IRS requires 
              your name, Social Security Number, and balance due. If you select 
              the credit card payment option, including credit card payment through 
              electronic filing, you are giving your consent for the TurboTax 
              for the Web federal product to gather this information from your 
              tax return and transmit it securely to our credit card payment partner. 
              Our partner uses this information solely to process payment of your 
              federal taxes. If you don’t want this information transmitted 
              to our credit card payment partner, we recommend payment by check. 
              You may also be requested to provide your contact information, such 
              as your e-mail address and phone number, which may be used to contact 
              you if there is a question about your payment.</p>
            <p> <strong>Tax Calculators.</strong> Information entered into the 
              Tax Calculators (e.g., Tax Estimator, W-4 Calculator) is used solely 
              to provide you with estimates of various tax situations. The Tax 
              Calculators do not link the information entered with personally 
              identifiable information. Unless otherwise noted in the calculator 
              description or instructions, once you close the tool, none of the 
              information used in these calculations is saved.</p>
            <p> <strong>Tax Planner.</strong> Information entered into the Tax 
              Planner section (e.g., 10-Year Tax Forecaster, Life Events Planner) 
              of the TurboTax for the Web products is used solely to provide you 
              with “what if” tax estimates. This information is stored 
              behind a firewall and remains on Intuit’s servers and is not 
              sent to the IRS or anyone else. </p>
            <p class="subhead1">We have limited relationships with third parties.</p>
            <p> Sometimes, we enter into contracts with third parties so that 
              they can assist us in servicing you (for example, fulfilling customer 
              orders or providing customer service). The contracts prohibit them 
              from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, 
              and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information 
              we provide to them. We may disclose or report personal information 
              in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure 
              is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose 
              personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement 
              authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, 
              subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.</p>
            <p> We also have business partners that provide services, some of 
              which are co-branded. Partner services and sites are clearly identified. 
              When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting 
              us to provide your personally identifiable information to the partner 
              to fulfill your request. If you visit one of their sites, you should 
              review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect 
              and use personally identifiable information, because we do not control 
              their privacy practices.</p>
            <p class="subhead1">You can change your contact information.</p>
            <p>You can update or correct your contact information by using the 
              <a href="http://turbotaxsupport.com/servicesupport/">TurboTax Support</a> 
              pages. Your filed tax return information, by law, cannot be changed.</p>
