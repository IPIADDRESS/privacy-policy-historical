At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals and small businesses manage their financial lives.  In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. We want you to know how your information is used.  To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines.
</p><p>This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the TurboTax.com, MacInTax.com, TurboTaxWeb.com Web sites and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the "TurboTax Web sites").  It serves as an adjunct to the <a href="http://privacy.intuit.com/policies">Intuit Online Privacy Policy</a>, which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites.  The TurboTax Web sites' privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.
</p><p>The Sites carry third party advertisers, and provide links to third party Web sites.  Intuit is not responsible for the actions of those parties.  You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.
</p><p>Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.

<p><b>WE PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF OUR WEB SITE INFORMATION PRACTICES.</b>
<br>To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed.
</p><p>Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:
</p><ul><li> <b>Preparation and Electronic Filing of Tax Returns</b>.  You may use Quicken TurboTax for the Web or Quicken TurboTax EZ for the Web products to assist you with the preparation and electronic filing of your tax return.  "Tax return information" is information provided by a taxpayer that is used to prepare a tax return with these TurboTax Web products.
<p>Intuit uses all tax return information only in accordance with applicable laws to provide the online tax preparation, electronic filing or other services you have requested.  Except as required to provide you with the products or services that you desire or as you otherwise consent or direct, Intuit does not disclose tax return information to third parties, nor does it use tax return information to market other Intuit or third parties' products or services.
</p><p>As a method for detecting fraud in tax information transmitted via the Internet, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Intuit to provide to the IRS, in connection with the electronic filing of tax returns, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated.  We are also required to notify the IRS whether the e-mail address of the person electronically filing the return has been collected.
</p><p></p></li><li> <b>Order and Payment Information</b>.  We gather contact and payment information from you to process your order. This information may include name, address, phone and e-mail address and as payment is required, credit card information. We may use your contact information to notify you of important product updates, significant tax law changes or promotional opportunities.
<p></p></li><li> <b>Tax Estimator</b>. Information entered into the Tax Estimator is used solely to provide you with tax estimates.  It does not collect personally identifiable information, and the information that you provide is neither saved nor transferred to any other party.
<p></p></li><li> <b>Contests and Surveys</b>. From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys.  If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences, or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings, or award prizes.  Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.
<p></p></li><li> <b>Mandatory and Optional Information</b>. We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request.  Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service. A decision to provide incomplete information in the preparation of a tax return, for example, will preclude the full and proper use of the TurboTax Web products. You cannot complete and file a tax return using Intuit's online tax products if you do not identify yourself, although you do not have to identify yourself to just try out the product.
</li></ul>
<p><b>HOW WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGY:</b>
<br>Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site:
</p></a><ul><a name="notice"></a><li><a name="notice"> <b>Cookies</b>. A 'cookie' is a small piece of information that our Web sites may provide to your browser while you are at our site. If you are a registered user on the TurboTax Web sites, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as those for tax return preparation and electronic filing.
<p>If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site.   Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and login to special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send it.  Otherwise, we will not be able to let you participate in certain areas of the Web sites.  Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. 
</p></a><p><a name="notice">Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you.  Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site.  You may choose not to accept these cookies.  Intuit does not control those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information. If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at </a><a href="https://orderupdate.intuit.com/record.asp?topic=privacy">privacy@intuit.com</a>.
</p><p></p></li><li> <b>Web Site Usage Data</b>.  With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL.  We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer.  This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting.
<p></p></li><li> <b>Co-branded and Third-Party Sites</b>. Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The TurboTax Web sites may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties.  We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.
</li></ul>
<p>If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.
</p><p>In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.
