<p>To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you 
  when you visit our Web sites or purchase or register our products or services. 
</p>
<p><b>Here is a description of the information we collect and how it is used:</b></p>
            <p> <b>Preparation and Electronic Filing of Tax Returns</b>.&nbsp; You 
              may use TurboTax for the Web Basic, TurboTax for the Web Deluxe, 
              TurboTax for the Web Premier, TurboTax for the Web Premier Home 
              &amp; Business, TurboTax for the Web 1040EZ, TurboTax for the Web 
              State, and TurboTax for the Web 1040EZ State, to assist you with 
              the online preparation and electronic filing of your tax return 
              (referred to as the “TurboTax for the Web products”).&nbsp; "Tax 
              return information" is information provided by a taxpayer that 
              is used to prepare a tax return with the TurboTax for the Web products. 
            </p>
<p>Intuit uses tax return information, only in accordance with applicable laws 
  to provide the online tax preparation, electronic filing or other services you 
  have requested.&nbsp; Except as required by law or to provide you with the products 
  or services that you specifically request or consent to, Intuit does not disclose 
  tax return information to third parties, nor does it use tax return information 
  to market other Intuit or third parties’ products or services.</p>
<p>As a method for detecting fraud in tax information 
  transmitted via the Internet, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Intuit 
  to provide to the IRS, in connection with the electronic filing of tax returns, 
  the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated.&nbsp; 
  We are also required to notify the IRS whether the e-mail address of the person 
  electronically filing the return has been collected.</p>
            <p> <b>Electronic Filing.</b>&nbsp; As an approved transmitter of electronically 
              filed federal and state income tax returns, we follow stringent 
              security guidelines to protect the security and privacy of your 
              data.&nbsp; Electronically filed tax returns are encrypted during transmission 
              to us. When transmitting your tax return, we use the most secure 
              transmission technology supported by the IRS and by state tax filing 
              agencies.&nbsp; To provide customer technical support when troubleshooting 
              e-filing related problems, such as acknowledgements or rejected 
              returns, we may ask you to resubmit your tax return to us. </p>
<p>  <b>Instant Data Entry</b>.&nbsp; Instant 
  Data Entry allows you to automatically retrieve and enter tax information from 
  sources such as participating employers, brokerages, payroll companies, mortgage 
  companies, and mutual fund companies, directly into the correct forms in the 
  TurboTax for the Web products.&nbsp; When you download information from such tax 
  data providers, you will be required to enter authentication information such 
  as your user name, account number and/or password.&nbsp; The TurboTax for the Web 
  products use this information solely for the purpose of providing authentication 
  to the tax data provider.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  <b>Order and Payment Information</b>.&nbsp; 
  We gather contact and payment information from you to process your order. This 
  information may include name, address, phone and e-mail address and, as payment 
  is required, credit card information. We do not share your information with 
  outside companies for their promotional use.&nbsp; On occasion, however, we may use 
  your contact information to notify you of important product updates, significant 
  tax law changes, or promotional opportunities about these or other Intuit products.&nbsp; 
  If you do not wish to receive these notices, you may opt out during the information 
  collection process or by visiting <a href="javascript:NewWindow('https://privacy.intuit.com/');" class="primary">https://privacy.intuit.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  We do not share your credit card information with third parties except to process 
  payment for the service you are requesting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  <b>Credit Card Payments.&nbsp; </b>If you 
  would like to pay your federal balance due by credit card, the IRS requires 
  your name, Social Security Number, and balance due.&nbsp; If you select the credit 
  card payment option, including credit card payment through electronic filing, 
  you are giving your consent for the TurboTax for the Web federal product to 
  gather this information from your tax return and transmit it securely to our 
  credit card payment partner.&nbsp; Our partner uses this information solely to process 
  payment of your federal taxes.&nbsp; If you don’t want this information transmitted 
  to our credit card payment partner, we recommend payment by check. You may also be requested to provide your contact information, such as your 
  e-mail address and phone number, which may be used to contact you if there is 
  a question about your payment.</p>
<p>  <b>Tax Calculators.</b>&nbsp; 
  Information entered into the Tax Calculators (e.g., Tax Estimator calculator) 
  is used solely to provide you with estimates of various tax situations.&nbsp; The 
  Tax Calculators do not link the information entered with personally identifiable 
  information.&nbsp; Unless otherwise noted in the calculator description or instructions, 
  once you close the tool, none of the information used in these calculations 
  is saved. </p>
<p>  <b>Tax Planner</b>. Information entered 
  into the Tax Planner section (e.g., Life Events planner) of the TurboTax for 
  the Web products is used solely to provide you with “what if” tax estimates. 
  This information is stored behind a firewall and remains on Intuit’s servers 
  and is not sent to the IRS or anyone else.</p>
<p>  <b>Bank Products.&nbsp; </b>You can choose 
  to apply for bank products, including a "refund anticipation loan" 
  (Quick Cash Loan) or “refund transfer”.&nbsp; These bank products are offered by 
  our partner, Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust (SBBT).&nbsp; When you apply for a refund 
  anticipation loan or refund transfer you are authorizing Intuit to disclose 
  your personal and tax return information to SBBT.&nbsp; Additionally, you should 
  consult the applicable bank product application to understand how SBBT will 
  use this information including: the processing and underwriting of your application; 
  collecting outstanding balances on any unpaid refund anticipation loans; and, 
  detecting, preventing and reporting fraud.</p>
<p>  <b>Purchase of Products and Services 
  with Tax Refund. </b>You may purchase certain Intuit products and services and 
  those of our partners, with the TurboTax for the Web products, by using your 
  tax refund.&nbsp; Intuit collects personally identifiable&nbsp;information to process 
  your order.&nbsp; We request certain contact information, including your shipping 
  address name, address, phone number and e-mail address.&nbsp; When you purchase those 
  products and services that are offered by our partners, you are authorizing 
  Intuit to disclose your customer information to our partners.&nbsp; We encourage 
  you to review our partner’s privacy policies to learn more about what, why and 
  how they collect, use, and store personally identifiable information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you have provided an e-mail address, an e-mail confirmation of your order 
  will be sent after your refund is funded by the IRS.&nbsp; Except as required by 
  law or to provide you with the products or services that you specifically request 
  or consent to, Intuit does not disclose tax return information to third parties, 
  nor does it use tax return information to market other Intuit or third parties’ 
  products or services.</p>
<p>  <b>Professional Tax Review.&nbsp; </b>You 
  can choose to have your tax return reviewed by a certified tax professional.&nbsp; 
  This service is offered by our partner, TaxResources, Inc. ("TRI").&nbsp; 
  When you agree to have your tax return reviewed by a certified tax professional, 
  you are authorizing Intuit to transmit your tax return to TRI.&nbsp; You should consult 
  the TRI Privacy Statement to understand how TRI will use this information.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Except as required by law or to provide you with the products 
  or services that you specifically request or consent to, Intuit does not disclose 
  tax return information to third parties, nor does it use tax return information 
  to market other Intuit or third parties’ products or services. </p>
            <p class="subhead1"><b>More on our general information practices.</b></p>
<p>  <b>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Surveys</b>. 
  From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests, sweepstakes 
  or surveys.&nbsp; If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, 
  preferences, or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, 
  improve our offerings, or award prizes.&nbsp; Our contests or sweepstakes may have 
  separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will 
  be used in each case.</p>
<p>  <b>Required and Optional Information</b>. 
  We identify what information is required to fulfill your request and what information 
  is optional.&nbsp; If you choose not to provide required information, we will not 
  be able to provide the service you are requesting. A decision to provide incomplete 
  information in the preparation of a tax return, for example, will preclude the 
  full and proper use of the TurboTax for the Web products. You cannot complete 
  and file a tax return using Intuit's online tax products if you do not identify 
  yourself, although you do not have to identify yourself to just try out the 
  product.</p>
<p>  <b>Newsletters.</b> We provide you the 
  opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. 
  You may unsubscribe at the subscription center or by following the instructions 
  provided in each e-mail newsletter. </p>
<p>  <b>Intuit Partners and Co-branded or 
  Third-Party Sites</b>.&nbsp; Some of the products and services offered on this Web 
  site are provided by Intuit’s business partners. To fulfill your request for 
  such services, we will forward your customer information to a partner, as necessary. 
  When offering partner services on an Intuit or co-branded site, the partner 
  who will be receiving your information will be clearly identified.&nbsp; The TurboTax 
  Web sites may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business 
  partners and online advertisers.&nbsp; On these sites either Intuit and/or its partners 
  may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions 
  of these third parties.&nbsp; We encourage you to review their privacy policies to 
  learn more about what, why and how they collect, use, and store personally identifiable 
  information. </p>
<p>  <b>E-mail Messaging</b>.&nbsp; When sending 
  you e-mail, we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to 
  format messages tailored to your computer’s capabilities.&nbsp; We also use this 
  technology to determine, in the aggregate, the number of people who open our 
  e-mails.&nbsp; When you initiate a response by clicking on a link within an e-mail 
  message, you are re-directed onto the internet.&nbsp; We then record your individual 
  response to help us deliver information that is more relevant to your interests.</p>
<p>  <b>Intuit and its Subsidiaries.</b>&nbsp; 
  Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange customer data with each other to fulfill 
  your request or to provide you with information about other products or services.</p>
<p>  <b>Service Providers.</b>&nbsp; In some cases, 
  we will use service providers such as consultants, temporary workers, third 
  party software developers, or outsourcers, to complete a business process or 
  provide a service on our behalf.&nbsp; For example, we may use service providers 
  to deliver products, to offer online software applications, or to send e-mails. 
  When we use service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable 
  information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally 
  identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf. </p>
<p>  <b>Service Alerts and Critical Notices.</b>&nbsp; 
  Although we respect and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we 
  may need to contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your 
  ability to use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such 
  as error alerts.&nbsp; We may also contact you to respond to your specific requests, 
  to clarify the order information you provided to us, or to notify you of upcoming 
  subscription expiration dates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  <b>Change of Control.</b> Your personally 
  identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, 
  transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) 
  of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will 
  have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information 
  following any change of control. </p>
<p>  <b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy.</b> 
  If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices 
  with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those 
  changes to this Web site 30 days before they take effect. </p>
<p>  <b>Legal Disclosures.</b>&nbsp; In some cases 
  we may disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as 
  a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.            </p>
            <p class="subhead1"><a name="webtechnologies"></a>We tell you how and why

  that you would like to use TurboTax for the Web products and you have modified 
  your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser 
  to accept the cookies that we send. Most browsers, by default, accept and maintain

  address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name,

  reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information

              how the personally identifiable information that you provide to 
              us may be used.</span></p>
<p>We give you the opportunity to control the use of your personally identifiable 
  information for purposes other than to fulfill your request.&nbsp; For example, on 
  occasion we may use your contact information to contact you about product updates, 
  significant tax law changes, or promotional opportunities about the TurboTax 
  for the Web products or other Intuit products, or those of our partners.&nbsp; If

<p>We provide you the opportunity to update or correct the personally identifiable 
  information that you have provided to us in product registration.&nbsp; Once you 
  have completed a tax return using a TurboTax for the Web product and directed 
  that it be electronically filed, you cannot change the information in it because

  must be made prior to the final tax filing deadline, which is generally October 
  15 each year.</p>

  review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>
