                                      <p align="left">Turbo Cash Generator&nbsp;strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of  Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized  experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name,  e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms  of this privacy policy. <strong>We will <u>never</u> sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period</strong>.</p>
                                      <p align="justify">How we gather information from users</p>
                                      <p align="justify">How  we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services  provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you  register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain  features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may  provide information when you participate in message boards and chat  rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,  our company also collects information automatically and through the use  of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For  example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use  cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your  visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and  password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each  time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a  particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt  additional technology, we may also gather information through other  means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with  information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept  cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of  the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and  we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your  preferences.</p>
                                      <p align="justify">What we do with the information we collect</p>
                                      <p align="justify">Like  other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your  privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
                                      <p align="justify">Aggregated  Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be  used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to  help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are  visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated  Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and  business partners. Again, this information does not include any  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.</p>
                                      <p align="justify">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on&nbsp;Turbo Cash Generator&nbsp;to  communicate with you about your registration and customization  preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and  products offered by&nbsp;Turbo Cash Generator&nbsp;and other topics we think you might find of interest. </p>
                                      <p align="justify">Personally Identifiable Information collected by&nbsp;Turbo Cash Generator&nbsp;may  also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,  administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications  with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the  operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access  such information. We will use your information only as permitted by  law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our  business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or  businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the  transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response  to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably  required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts  you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we  deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you  with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
                                      <p align="justify">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
                                      <p align="justify">Turbo Cash Generator&nbsp;expects  its partners, advertisers and members to respect the privacy of our  users.

For example,  some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include  cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a  particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site  may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or  other technology to gather information.&nbsp;Turbo Cash Generator&nbsp;does not control the use of this technology by third  parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any  actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
                                      <p align="justify">You  should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that  information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by  third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited  messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are  beyond the control of Turbo Cash Generator and this policy.</p>

Your continued use of our site following the  posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.  Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be  used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the  information was collected.</p>
