<h3>Turn2us Confidentiality Policy</h3>
<p>Turn2us is bound by the UK’s Data Protection Act which
implements the European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive. This
protects personal data and places restrictions on Turn2us’s ability
to disclose personal data within the UK and overseas.</p>
<p>Personal data is information relating to an individual from
which they can be identified, e.g. name, address, tax details or
national insurance number.</p>
<p>Turn2us staff will often be entrusted with personal information
given to them in confidence by users of Turn2us services.&nbsp;
Anyone working for Turn2us has a duty to treat that information
with respect.&nbsp; They also have a duty under the Data Protection
Act 1998 to protect the confidentiality of personal information and
to process that information fairly.</p>
<p><a href="/privacy_statement.aspx#Top">Back to top of page</a></p>
<h4><a name="Data" title="Bookmark Target"></a><strong>Data Protection Act</strong></h4>
<p><span>T</span>he Data Protection Act regulates when and how an
individual’s ‘personal data’ may be obtained, held, used, disclosed
and generally processed. It applies to computerised processing of
personal data and certain paper-based files and records.</p>
<p>To comply with the law, information must be collected and used
fairly, stored securely and not disclosed to any other person
unlawfully.</p>
<p>To do this, Turn2us staff must comply with the Data Protection
Principles, which are set out in the Data Protection Act.&nbsp; In
summary, these state that personal data shall be:</p>
<ul>
<li>processed fairly and lawfully and shall not be processed unless
certain conditions are met</li>
<li>obtained for specified and lawful purposes and not further
processed in a manner which is incompatible with that purpose</li>
<li>adequate, relevant and not excessive</li>
<li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date</li>
<li>kept for no longer than is necessary</li>
<li>processed in accordance with the data subject’s rights</li>
<li>protected by appropriate security</li>
<li>not transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area
(EEA), unless that country has equivalent levels of protection for
personal data.</li>
<li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none"><a href="/privacy_statement.aspx#Top">Back to
top of page</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Requests" title="Bookmark Target"></a><strong>Requests by data subjects for access to data
held</strong></h4>
<p>If a user wishes to see any personal information about them held
by Turn2us, this can be shown to him or her and a copy made if one
is requested.&nbsp; If a third party is acting on behalf of the
user, proof of identity and the user's authority to disclose their
information to their representative, must be obtained in
writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All requests must be responded to within 20 working days.</p>
<p><a href="/privacy_statement.aspx#Top">Back to top of page</a></p>
<h4><a name="Breaking" title="Bookmark Target"></a><strong>Breaking confidentiality</strong></h4>
<p>Confidentiality may be broken in the following
circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the person from whom the information was obtained, and
(if different) the person to whom it relates, consents</li>
<li>Where the information is already available to the public from
other sources</li>
<li>Where the information is in the form of a summary or collection
of information so framed that it is not possible to ascertain from
it information relating to any particular person</li>
<li>When there is a serious risk of harm to the individual, as in a
threatened suicide</li>
<li>To protect others.&nbsp; For example, information about
possible child abuse should be disclosed to the appropriate
agency</li>
<li style="WIDTH: 714px; HEIGHT: 0.64%">To prevent a serious
criminal act, especially where others may be endangered, for
example an act of terrorism.<br>
There is no obligation in general to pass on knowledge of a
crime.&nbsp; However, it is a criminal offence to:</li>
</ul>
<p class="ImmIndent_1">- Deliberately mislead the police.<br>
- To receive a reward of any kind in return for not notifying the
police about a criminal act.<br>
- Not to notify the police about an act that could be construed as
an act of terrorism.<br>
- Not to notify the police about an act that could be construed as
drug trafficking.</p>
<p>If a member of Turn2us staff has to break confidentiality then
the person whose personal information it is must be told that this
is going to happen in writing.&nbsp; The member of staff should
only do so after all attempts to persuade the individual to
disclose the information voluntarily have failed.&nbsp; The Turn2us
Head of Services should be consulted before disclosure. They will
be responsible for making the final decision about breaching
confidentiality and ensuring that the correct action is taken.</p>
