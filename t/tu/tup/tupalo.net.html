<h3>
About Tupalo
</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://tupalo.com/en/contact_impressum">Tupalo</a> is an
interactive Internet Service providing a tool for users to find,
review and share local entertainment, business and shopping
resources in locations around the world which are of interest to
the user. Users provide most content contained within Tupalo by
creating and sharing their personal experiences and opinions of
establishments contained within the Tupalo database. Aditionally
we work with data partners that provide us with location data of
businesses around the world.  For the purpose of this privacy
policy, a “user” is defined as any member of the public who takes
advantage of the Services provided by Tupalo.  A “friend” is
defined as any registered member of Tupalo who has been actively
invited or given permission to connect and share reviews,
favorites and private messages with another user via Services
provided by Tupalo. A “spot” is defined as any company, person or
establishment operating a business or organization that users
interact with via Services provided by Tupalo.
</p>
<h3>
Tupalo’s Privacy Policy
</h3>
<p>
Tupalo is adamant about protecting the personal information of
it’s users. In this privacy policy we’ll explain how, when and
why personal information is collected, used, and disclosed via
Tupalo (also described as “we” and the “Site”).
</p>
<p>
By registering with and taking advantage of the Services that
Tupalo offers, you consent to the privacy practices described in
this policy below. These policies will be modified from time to
time by Tupalo, so please check back periodically to see if
changes have been made.
</p>
<h3>
Information We Collect
</h3>
<p>
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do
so – for example, to provide our Services to you and other users,
to communicate with you, or to improve our Services to you.
</p>
<p>
We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide
information to us, automatically through operating our Services,
and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we
collect.
</p>
<h4>
Information You Provide to Us
</h4>
<p>
It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you
provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the
context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Basic Account Information: &nbsp;We ask for basic information from
you in order to set up your account. For example, we require
individuals who sign up for a Tupalo account to provide a
username and email address–and that’s it. You may provide us
with more information–like your name–but we don’t require that
information to create a Tupalo account.  Never will Tupalo
display your email address to another user visiting your
profile, even when a mutually agreed friendship is present.
</li>
<li>
Profile Information: &nbsp;If you have an account with us, we
collect the information that you provide for your profile. For
example, if you have a Tupalo account, your username is part of
that profile, along with any other information you add to your
profile, such as a photo, your home town/country, a Biography
description or social media links. Your default location,
entered as City and Country, is shared publicly via your
personal profile by default, but can be disabled by editing
your profile.
</li>
<li>
Transaction and Billing Information: If you, as a
representative of an establishment/business/spot, buy a
subscription to a Tupalo plan from us, you will provide
additional personal and payment information that is required to
process the transaction and your payment, such as your name,
credit card information, and contact information.
</li>
<li>
Content Information: Tupalo collects user-submitted photos,
ratings &amp; reviews, bookmarks and favorites of users for
businesses and Service providers. This user-submitted
information is public by default and accessible to all users of
Tupalo.  Tupalo collects user-submitted checkins of users for
businesses and Service providers. This user-submitted
information is partially public when a user has the most
checkins to a spot ("Kaiser")
</li>
<li>
Credentials: &nbsp;Depending on the Services you use, you may
provide us with credentials for other web services you use.
</li>
<li>
Communications With Us (Hi There!):&nbsp;You may also provide us
with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with
us about a support question, content issue and feedback.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Information We Collect Automatically
</h4>
<p>
We also collect some information automatically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Log Information: &nbsp;Like most online service providers, we collect
information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers
typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address,
unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the
date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network
information.
</li>
<li>
Usage Information: &nbsp;We collect information about your usage of
our Services. For example, we collect information about the
actions users perform on Tupalo – in other words, who did what,
when and where on Tupalo (e.g., [username]
reviewed/rated/liked/saved or edited [spot] on Tupalo at
[time/date]) We also collect information about what happens
when you use our Services (e.g., page views, searches) along
with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of
cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this
information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as
well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can
make our Services better.
</li>
<li>
Location Information: &nbsp;We may determine the approximate location
of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this
information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our
Services from certain geographic regions and to allow us to
detect and warn you about suspicious account activity . We may
also collect information about your precise location via our
mobile apps (when, for example, you post a review for a spot or
check-in to a spot) if you allow us to do so through your mobile
device operating system’s permissions.
</li>
<li>
Stored Information: &nbsp;We may access information stored on your
mobile device via our mobile app. We access this stored
information through your device operating system’s permissions.
For example, if you give us permission to access the
photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services
may access selected photos stored on your device when you upload a
really amazing photograph of your latest lunch to a Tupalo spot.
</li>
<li>
Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies: A cookie is a
string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website
each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web
beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails.
Tupalo uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help
us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for
our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign
effectiveness, to deliver targeted ads and provide performance
tracking to some of our data partners. For more information
about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking,
including how you can control the use of cookies, please see
our&nbsp;<a href="#cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Information We Collect from Other Sources
</h4>
<p>
We may get information about users from other sources. For
example, if you log into Tupalo account through another service
(Facebook, Twitter, Google), we will receive information from
that service (such as your username, basic profile information,
and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that
service. The information we receive depends on which services you
authorize and any options that are available.
</p>
<p>
Tupalo collects information about spots, such as name, address,
phone-number, website and socialmedia links either via user
submissions or from data partners. In some cases this information
refers to a one-person business and thus might be considered personal
information in some juristictions.
</p>
<h3>
How and Why We Use Information
</h3>
<h4>
Purposes for Using Information
</h4>
<p>
We use information about you as mentioned above and for the
purposes listed below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To provide our Services – for example, to set up and maintain
your Tupalo user account or Tupalo business account, charge
you for any of our paid plans, display your public profile and
the content you contributed on our Service, or allow you to
contact other users on the service via friend requests or
messages;
Some spot pages (listing pages, business pages) might refer to
one-person businesses and allow our users to find information
about said business as well write reviews and ratings and
upload photos regarding the one-person business. We use this
information based on the legitimate interest of running a
ratings and review platform for local businesses.
</li>
<li>
To further develop and improve our Services – for example by
adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will
help our users and business owners with the Service.
</li>
<li>
To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users
interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services
and make them easier to use;
</li>
<li>
To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our
advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition
– for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a
plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used
by those who continue to use our Services after a certain
length of time;
</li>
<li>
To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect
the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent
transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and
protect the rights and property of Tupalo and others, which may
result in us declining a transaction or the use of our
Services;
</li>
<li>
To communicate with you, for example through an email, about
offers and promotions offered by Tupalo and others we think will
be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to
date on Tupalo and our products; and
</li>
<li>
To personalize your experience using our Services, target our
marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those
who have a particular business plan with us or have been our
user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant
advertisements.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
</h4>
<p>
A note here for those in the European Union about our legal
grounds for processing information about you under EU data
protection laws (GDPR), which is that our use of your information is
based on the grounds that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to
you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with you or
is necessary to administer your account – for example, in order
to enable access to our website on your device or charge you
for a paid plan; or
</li>
<li>
(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal
obligation; or
</li>
<li>
(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital
interests or those of another person; or
</li>
<li>
(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information –
for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our
Services so that we can offer you an even better user
experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you,
to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our
advertising, and better understand user retention and
attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our
Services, and to personalize your experience; or
</li>
<li>
(5) You have given us your consent – for example before we
place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze
them later on, as described in our&nbsp;<a href="#cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclosing Information</h3>
<h4>How We Disclose Information</h4>
<p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information.</p>
<p>
We disclose information about you in the limited circumstances
spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your
privacy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:&nbsp;We may
disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our
employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors
that need to know the information in order to help us provide
our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We
require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent
contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal
information that we disclose to them.
</li>
<li>
Third Party Vendors:&nbsp;We may disclose information about you with
third party vendors who need to know information about you in
order to provide their services to us. This group includes
vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment
providers that process your credit and debit card information,
fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent
payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that
help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support
services that help us communicate with you), those that assist
us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for
identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our
marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance
our Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to
agree to privacy commitments in order to disclose information
with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific
policies (e.g. our&nbsp;Cookie Policy).
</li>
<li>
Legal Requests:&nbsp;We may disclose information about you in
response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental
request.
</li>
<li>
To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:&nbsp;We may disclose
information about you when we believe in good faith that
disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
rights of Tupalo, third parties, or the public at large.
</li>
<li>
Business Transfers:&nbsp;In connection with any merger, sale of
company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
business by another company, or in the unlikely event that
Tupalo goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
information would likely be one of the assets that is
transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these
events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to
apply to your information and the party receiving your
information may continue to use your information, but only
consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</li>
<li>
Aggregated or De-Identified Information:&nbsp;We may disclose
information that has been aggregated or reasonably
de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be
used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate
statistics about the use of our Services and we may disclose a
hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized
ad campaigns on other platforms.
</li>
<li>
Published Support Requests:&nbsp;And if you send us a request (for
example, via a support email or one of our feedback
mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in
order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
us support other users.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Information you share publicly
</h4>
<p>
Through Tupalo, you are able to publish reviews, comments, forum
discussions and other Content which becomes publicly available.
Anonymous and Unregistered Users are able to search within and
access Content created and published via this Service. Please do
not post any personal information on this website which you wish
to keep private.
</p>
<p>
You further acknowledge that when you voluntarily disclose
information about yourself within Submitted Content to this Site,
such information can be collected, compiled and published by
third parties (e.g. search engines) unknowingly to Tupalo and
it’s administrators. This may result in unsolicited messages from
other people or companies not affiliated with Tupalo or it’s
administrators. Please do not post any personal information on
this website which you wish to keep private.
</p>
<p>
Per our terms of use, we have the right to republish your
Submitted Content to third parties who in turn may display or
publish such information in connection with their own websites,
search engines, products, mobile platforms, and other media,
whether electronic in nature or otherwise. Please do not post any
personal information on this website which you wish to keep
private.
</p>
<h3>
How Long We Keep Information
</h3>
<p>
We generally discard information about you when we no longer need
the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it
— which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use
Information — and we are not legally required to continue to keep
it.
</p>
<h3>
Security
</h3>
<p>
While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to
protect information about you against unauthorized access, use,
alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do
so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities
and attacks and when possible storing your data encrypted at rest.
All registered Tupalo accounts are password-protected, which are
hashed within our databases. This means that only you, the user,
are in possession of your password. While employees of Tupalo
have access to portions of our database, all passwords are stored
in a form which is unreadable.
</p>
<p>
You must be aware that when you voluntarily disclose your
personally identifiable information (user name, email address,
name, etc) via reviews, messages, forums, lists, personal
messages, friend requests or any features involving two-way
communication between users on Tupalo, this information may
possibly be collected and used by third parties in ways
considered abusive. Activities such as this are beyond the scope
of Tupalo’s responsibility. For the sake of your personal
security, we ask that you not post any personally identifiable
information you wish to keep private via the Tupalo Site or
Services.
</p>
<p>
Your personal information can always be modified by
logging into your personal profile and editing the minimal
personal information we collect. Registered users who wish to
have their account removed are able to do this via their profile.
Upon request, all personal identifiable information will be removed,
as well as as much information related to content you provided
as commercially possible without affecting the quality of
Service and functionality of the Tupalo Service. Some residual
non personal identifiable information may not be able to be removed.
</p>
<p>
If permissable by law, by registering with Tupalo you are
acknowledging that Tupalo is not responsible for any intercepted
information sent via the internet and you further release Tupalo
from any and all claims which may arise of or related to the
unauthorized use of intercepted information.
</p>
<h3>
External Links
</h3>
<p>
Tupalo contains many links which point to third party websites
and service which we have no direct affiliation with. By your
visiting such third party links via Tupalo, you acknowledge that
Tupalo or it’s administrators are not responsible for the privacy
policies or terms of use of third party sites which are linked to
via Tupalo. We do not share personal information with third party
sites and services by your visiting such sites and services via
links found on Tupalo.
</p>
<h3 id="cookies">
Cookies and Our Usage of Cookies
</h3>
<p>
Tupalo uses “cookies”. A cookie is a small file that can be
stored on your computer when you visit a website. Basically,
cookies are used to provide users with additional functions on a
website. For example, they may be used to help you navigate a web
page, to allow you to continue to use a web page where you left
it, or to save your preferences and settings when you revisit
that website. Cookies cannot access, read or modify any other
data on your computer.  Most cookies on this website are
so-called session cookies. They will be automatically deleted
when you leave our website. Permanent cookies, however, remain on
your computer until you manually delete them in your browser. We
use such permanent cookies to recognize you when you next visit
our website.  If you want to control cookies on your computer,
you can choose your browser settings to get a notification when a
webpage wants to save cookies. You can also block or delete
cookies if they have already been saved on your computer. If you
want to know more about how to set these steps, please use the
“Help” function in your browser.  Please note that blocking or
deleting cookies could interfere with your online experience and
prevent you from fully using this website.
</p>
<h3>
Choices
</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Limit the Information that You Provide: &nbsp;If you have an account
with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account
information and profile information. Please keep in mind that
if you do not provide this information, certain features of our
Services may not be accessible.
</li>
<li>
Limit Access to Information On Your Mobile Device: &nbsp;Your mobile
device operating system should provide you with the ability to
discontinue our ability to collect stored information or
location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may
not be able to use certain features (like checking in to a spot,
for example).
</li>
<li>
Opt-Out of Electronic Communications: &nbsp;You may opt out of
receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the
instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional
messages, we may still send you other messages, like those
about your account and legal notices.
</li>
<li>
Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies: &nbsp;At this time, Tupalo does
not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our
Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser
to remove or reject browser cookies before using Tupalo's
websites, with the drawback that certain features of Tupalo's
websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
</li>
<li>
Close Your Account: &nbsp;While we’d be very sad to see you go, if
you no longer want to use our Services  you can&nbsp;close your
Tupalo user account. Please keep in mind that we may continue
to retain your information after closing your account, as
described in How Long We Keep Information above – for example,
when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or
demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law
enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate
business interests.
</li>
<li>
Request that we remove your spot page (listing page, business page):
Deleting a spot requires us to verify that you are the owner of
the business. Please get in touch with us by sending an email
to feedback@tupalo.com. To avoid ambiguities, please inlcude
the URL (Website address) of the listing. We will then remove
your business listing from our database entirely.
See our <a href="http://tupalo.com/en/faq">FAQ</a> for more information.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Your Rights
</h3>
<p>
If you are located in certain countries, including those that
fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection
Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights
with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions
provided by the law, including the rights to:
</p><ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>

Because Tupalo Services are offered worldwide, the information
about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may

the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us or third party
data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the
How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing
information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take
appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your
personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy
Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:
</p><ul>
<li>
In the case of US based entities, entering into European
Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with
them, or ensuring they have signed up to the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">EU-US Privacy Shield</a>; or

<h3>
Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
</h3>
<p>
Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by
advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics
services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics
providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect
information about your use of our Services and across other
websites and online services. These technologies allow these
third parties to recognize your device to compile information
about you or others who use your device. This information allows
us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track
usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver
advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests.
Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of
information by Tupalo and does not cover the collection of
information by any third party advertisers or analytics
providers.
