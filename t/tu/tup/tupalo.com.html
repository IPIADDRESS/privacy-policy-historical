  <h2>Tupalo's Privacy Policy</h2>

  <br><br>

  <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
  Tupalo collects information based on content submitted by users, such as full name and email address. Tupalo does not sell or share your email address with any third party companies or lists. Email addresses are only displayed to the owning registered user when they are logged in and viewing their own profile. Never will Tupalo display your email address to another user visiting your profile, even when a mutually agreed friendship is present.
  <br><br>
  Tupalo also collects user-submitted information such as city, state, zip and country. Your default location, entered as City and Country, is shared publicly via your personal profile by default, but can be disabled by editing your profile.
  <br><br>
  Tupalo also collects user-submitted photos, reviews and ratings of businesses and service providers. This user-submitted information is public by default and accessible to all users of Tupalo.

  <h2>How Personal Information Is Used</h2>
  Your profile page, which may contain your first name, profile picture, display name and any personally identifiable information you have chosen to including is publicly accessible to any users of the service Tupalo provides via the reviews and ratings you have contributed to Tupalo. If a person is mutually recognized as a friend, they will also have access to your personally created list of favorite locations. 
  <br><br>
  Your first name or display name (if specifically set) and email address will be used when you send any form of email notification to a friend, such as private messages, friend requests and location recommendations.

  <br><br>
  Per our terms of use, we have the right to republish your content as we see fit. We will never sell your reviews and/or content to third parties, however we may use content you have created in future promotional material.
