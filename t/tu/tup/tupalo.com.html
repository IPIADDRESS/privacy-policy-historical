<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h4>This agreement is effective as of August 11, 2009</h4>
<p class="static_text">
</p><h2>About Tupalo</h2>
<p><a href="http://tupalo.com/">Tupalo.com</a> is an interactive web Service providing a tool for users to find, review and share local entertainment and shopping resources in locations around the world which are of interest to the user. Users provide all content contained within Tupalo by creating and sharing their personal experiences and opinions of establishments contained within the Tupalo database. For the purpose of this privacy policy, a “user” is defined as any member of the public who takes advantage of the Services provided by Tupalo. A “friend” is defined as any registered member of Tupalo who has been actively invited or given permission to connect and share reviews, favorites and private messages with another user via Services provided by Tupalo.</p>
<h2>Tupalo’s Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Tupalo is adamant about protecting the personal information of it’s users. In this privacy policy we’ll explain how, when and why personal information is collected, used, and disclosed via Tupalo (also described as “we” and the “Site”).</p>

<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Tupalo collects information based on content submitted by users, such as full name and email address. Tupalo does not sell or share your email address with any third party companies or lists.

Never will Tupalo display your email address to another user visiting your profile, even when a mutually agreed friendship is present.</p>
<p>Tupalo also collects user-submitted information such as city, state, zip and country. Your default location, entered as City and Country, is shared publicly via your personal profile by default, but can be disabled by editing your profile.</p>
<p>Tupalo also collects user-submitted photos, reviews and ratings of businesses and Service providers. This user-submitted information is public by default and accessible to all users of Tupalo.</p>
<p>Some information is collected while not informing the user. Information such as browser-related information, IP addresses, referral URL, time-stamp and entry/exit pages are such information.
