    <p>
        We at the "Tudosearch" website understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach you, the public, in new and exciting ways with
        information about our programming, interactive content, news, and other forms of interaction. Visitors to our Web site can be confident that we are
        very respectful of their privacy concerns. Specifically, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information
        collected about our visitors. As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as name, address or e-mail address, is automatically
        collected from visitors to our site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Tudosearch" website encourages parents to supervise their children's activities online and to participate with their children whenever possible
        and to consider installing parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help ensure children's safety online.
        These tools can prevent children from disclosing personally identifiable information, such as their name, address or e-mail address without parental
        permission. The "Tudosearch" website does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. You must be 18

    </p>
