<h1>Tuft &amp; Needle Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>1. Welcome</h2>

<p>Hi! Thank you for visiting tuftandneedle.com. This Privacy Policy, like our Terms of Service, is an integral part of using our service, and you must completely agree to it in order to use our Site and Service.</p>

<h2>2.  Definitions</h2>

<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy, we may use certain words or phrases, and it is important that you understand the meaning of them. Reading is FUN-damental and this list is not all-encompassing and no definition should be considered binding to the point that it renders this Privacy Policy nonsensical:</p>

<p>“Agreement” means these Terms of Service;</p>

<p>“Tuft &amp; Needle” refers to the business which owns this website (Tuft &amp; Needle), our Site, or our Service, depending on the context of the usage;</p>

<p>“Service” refers to the services that we provide through our Site, including but not limited to our online store;</p>

<p>“Site” refers to our website, tuftandneedle.com;</p>

<p>“Konnichiwa” is a colloquial greeting that Japanese people use with other Japanese people;</p>

<p>“You” refers to you, the person who is entering into this Agreement with Tuft &amp; Needle.</p>

<h2>3.  Information Collected</h2>

<p><strong>Identifying Information Collected by Us</strong></p>

<p>Have you ever been to a taxidermy store?  Generally, taxidermists collect dead animals just to be creepy and weird.  At Tuft &amp; Needle we also collect things.  However, these things aren’t dead animals and aren’t creepy and weird.  Instead we merely collect certain personal information from you when you purchase our Services that can be used to identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card information, and telephone number.  This information is disclosed only in accordance with our Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Some of this information—particularly credit card payment information—may be transmitted to the third party payment processor that we use, www.stripe.com, to enable us to process your payments, or you may be required to submit your information to www.stripe.com directly.  Stripe has its own Privacy Policy and other conditions of use, and we recommend that you read their documents carefully in order to understand your rights on that website.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong></p>

<p>Whenever you visit our Site, we may collect non-identifying information from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie (snickerdoodle is always the best) information, and Internet Service Provider.  Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, or additional records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.</p>

<h2>4.  Use of Your Information</h2>

<p>We may use your information:</p>

<ul>
<li>To enhance or improve users’ experiences, our Site, or Service.</li>
<li>To process transactions.</li>
<li>To sell, exchange, or transfer with a third party with your consent.  You hereby grant us consent to such sale, exchange, and transfer, and agree that we require no further consent to engage in this activity.</li>
<li>To send e-mails about our Site or respond to inquiries.</li>
<li>To PURCHASE A THIRD KIDNEY (just kidding, making sure you were awake).</li>
<li>To send e-mails about the Site and other products, news, or updates for Tuft &amp; Needle, or other businesses, websites, or services owned or operated by us.</li>
<li>To send e-mails about third party products or services.</li>
</ul>


<h2>5.  Accessing, Editing, and Removing Your Information</h2>

<p>Like He-Man you have the power.  Therefore users may in some cases be able to review and edit the personal information they have provided to us by logging into their account on the Site and editing their account.  Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser’s cache.  We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such.  In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.</p>

<h2>6.  Cookies</h2>

<p>Our cookies are not edible! We use cookies to save your preferences, keep track of advertisements, and remember your shopping cart preferences.  For this reason, you must have cookies enabled in your browser to use our Site and Services.</p>

<h2>7.  Third Parties</h2>

<h2>7.1  Third Party Websites</h2>

Therefore as a user of our Site you should only proceed to third party sites with caution. You acknowledge that you are aware that these third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by us, and you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties.  Tuft &amp; Needle bears no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links or through our Service.</p>

<h2>7.2  Purchases</h2>

<p>You will be required to provide your financial information to Stripe when paying Tuft &amp; Needle for purchases of goods or services.  It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your payment details when making purchases through this third party, and we recommend that you conduct routine credit bureau checks to protect your identity.</p>

<h2>8.  Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>

<p>Although you are entering into an Agreement with Tuft &amp; Needle to disclose your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of our provision of our Services to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information.  For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire third parties to assist us in maintaining, repairing, improving, or otherwise assisting us with our Site and Services.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.  For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.  You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>

<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that we may share your information with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Analytics, Github Gauges, and Mixpanel to provide website analytics.</li>
<li>Stripe, to process payments.</li>
</ul>


<h2>9.  Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>At times disclosure of your information may be required to comply with law enforcement. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.  In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.  We may also proactively report you and release your information without receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is proper to do so for legal reasons, such as instances where we believe your publications violate any law of the United States or any other country having jurisdiction over us, our Site, Services, or our Terms of Service.  You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.  We may release your information under the conditions listed in this paragraph whether it is to individuals or entities in the State of Arizona, the rest of the United States, or elsewhere.</p>

<h2>10.  Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</h2>

<p>We love spam but only the type that comes in a can.  By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email from us since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us or anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Don’t you hate it when you can’t find the unsubscribe button? At Tuft &amp; Needle we endeavour to make it easy for you to discontinue communications with us therefore you may have the ability to opt out of some communications.  If you make a request to unsubscribe from any further communications we will do our best to remove you promptly from our database.</p>

<h2>11.  Security Measures</h2>

<p>At Tuft &amp; Needle we take our consumer security very seriously.  Don’t worry we aren’t pulling rent-a-cop status, we aim for a Jedi Knight level of security.  Thus, we take certain measures to enhance the security of our Site and Services, including using SSL Certificates and PCI DSS-compliant hosting.  However, we make no representations as to the security or privacy of your information.  It is in our interest to keep our website secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software, routine credit checks, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security and privacy threats.</p>

<h2>12.  Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>If you’ve noticed California has special people and special laws.  Since Tuft &amp; Needle loves all people including special people we permit residents of the State of California to use our Service, and we are in compliance with the California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579.  If you are a California resident you may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the Californian privacy statutes. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors. You may contact us at hello@tuftandneedle.com with any questions.</p>

<h2>13.  International Transfer</h2>

<p>Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Tuft &amp; Needle may transfer personal information to the United States or elsewhere and process it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<h2>14.  Amendments</h2>

<p>Like our Terms of Service, we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will place a note on our Site as to when the Privacy Policy was last modified.  You must agree to the amendments as a condition of your continued use of our Site and Service.  If you do not agree, you must immediately cease using our Site and Service and notify us of your refusal to agree by e-mailing us at hello@tuftandneedle.com.</p>
