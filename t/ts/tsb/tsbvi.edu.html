<h1><a name="top">About</a> the TSBVI Web Site</h1>
<p>This page and the entire TSBVI World Wide Web site strives to be accessible
to all people.</p>
<h3><a name="Purpose">Purpose</a></h3>
<p>The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired World Wide Web site
reflects the schools vision of serving as a leading center of educational
expertise for students with visual impairments. The TSBVI website strives to be
a model for web site design to ensure the information is accessible to
individuals with visual impairments. Such information can be easily transformed
into Braille, large print, voice output, and regular text. As a technical
information resource, the site will focus on four areas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Training </strong>- materials to support training and education,
  announcements of upcoming training events, and provision of on-line training</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Research</strong> - provide for the ongoing development and
  dissemination of research information developed here at TSBVI, within the
  State of Texas, and elsewhere. It is our hope that such information will
  coordinate the efforts of professionals working in the classroom, educational
  center, and academic context</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Curricula</strong> - provide for the efficient sharing of
  information concerning education of students with visual impairments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Technical</strong> - provide resources for professionals, parents,
  and lay persons associated with programs for the visually impaired and
  deaf/blind throughout the state, country, and world</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All resources on the TSBVI Web page are in the public domain unless otherwise
noted. You are welcome to use these resources as needed provided that the TSBVI
Web page is cited as the source. A basic tenet of TSBVI is to promote the
collegial sharing of information. You are invited to submit items for
publication on the website. In all cases author contact information will be
included. In this manner, we hope to build a valuable resource to promote the
development of instructional materials and resources.</p>
<h3><a name="Web">Web</a> Site Usability Features</h3>
<p>If you have a visual impairment there are many options which you can control
from the selection of an accessible browser to modifying your browser to meet
your needs. Visit the <a href="technology/web.htm">Large Print and Speech Access
to the World Wide Web.</a></p>
<p>This website strives to follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT">Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>The Texas image on each page will link back to the home page</p>
<p>Every graphics image will have alt text to name the graphic. Where
appropriate, a graphic will be followed by a D link that provides an in-depth
description of the image</p>
<p>When practical, two dimensional tables will be presented as visual tables and
also converted to a linear speech-friendly format. When web technology improves
to allow understandable speech access to tables, this convention will be
discontinued.</p>
