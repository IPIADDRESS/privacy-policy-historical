<p>Our Services connect with and rely on various third party websites and tools unrelated to FSS. In an attempt to provide increased value to our Users, we may also choose various third party web Sites, such as Google, Yahoo and Bing, to link to, connect with or frame within the Site. We also may participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer other services and features to our Users. We have no control over these linked Sites and third party services, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us.&nbsp; We encourage you to read the policies of these third party websites. By engaging with third party websites, services and tools through our Site, Software and Services, you consent to our providing your PII to those third parties. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party websites (even if offered on or through our Site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for the independent policies or actions of third parties, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such website or services. These linked sites, services and tools are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the services and the links placed upon each of them and therefore request any feedback.</p>
<p>Further, any linking with any other website is neither an endorsement of that website nor any of the products or services that may be offered on that website.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Your PII or financial information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets of FSS or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose PII or financial information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of FSS or other Users of the Site or Services.&nbsp; Whenever PII or financial information is disclosed under this paragraph, we may also disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>How does FSS Protect Users Personal Information?&nbsp; </strong>We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your PII on our systems.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Please be aware that emails or other messages you send to us are not necessarily secure against interception and you should not include sensitive information in those messages. We generally will not ask for your credit or debit card number, password or other sensitive information in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.</p>
<p>Except for SSL transmissions, the Site is not encrypted. Access to your Account profile is restricted by your password.</p>
<p><br>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third parties may unlawfully attempt to intercept or access transmissions or private communications and other Users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site.&nbsp; Although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.&nbsp;</p>

<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>How Long Do We Keep your Information? </strong>Except as otherwise provided, User’s PII is maintained by us no longer than necessary for the purposes set out and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.&nbsp; When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.&nbsp; In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
