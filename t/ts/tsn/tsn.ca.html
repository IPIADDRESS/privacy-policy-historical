<p> 
<i>Last updated May 16, 2002</i>
</p><p>
<b>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY USING THE SERVICE OR WEBSITE REFERENCING THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU AGREE, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME. </b>
</p><p>
At Bell Globemedia Interactive Inc. ("BGI"), protecting your privacy is very important to us. Our goal is to treat the Personal Information you furnish us with the utmost respect and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains how personal information about you may be collected, used, or disclosed as a consequence of your activities on or related to a BGI website ("BGI Site") or a BGI service ("BGI Service"). It also explains how you can ask questions and make suggestions about our privacy practices, and review and update your personal information. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
</p><p>
<b>ACCEPTANCE:</b> This Privacy Policy applies to all BGI Sites which reference this Privacy Policy. By subscribing to, or otherwise using, a BGI Site or any BGI Service or content available on a BGI Site, you are confirming to BGI that you (i) are of the age of majority or older in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and (ii) agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions") applicable to a BGI Site and BGI Service and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, your sole recourse is to not use a BGI Site or BGI Service and, in the case of a subscription service, to cancel your subscription in accordance with the relevant subscription terms and conditions. 
</p><p>
<b>PERSONAL INFORMATION:</b> For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" is defined as information about an identifiable individual, not including the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. 
This Privacy Policy contains information on: 
</p><ul>
<li><a href="#1">1.	What information do we collect? </a>
</li><li><a href="#2">2.	Personal information collection, use and distribution to third parties </a>
</li><li><a href="#3">3.	How is your information secured and protected? </a>
</li><li><a href="#4">4.	What if we change our Privacy Policy? </a>
</li><li><a href="#5">5.	Web site links </a>
</li><li><a href="#6">6.	Additional Privacy Procedures </a>
</li><li><a href="#7">7.	How do you access and update your information? </a>
</li><li><a href="#8">8.	Who can I contact with questions, comments or suggestions? </a>
</li></ul>
<p>
<a name="1"></a>   
<b>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b> 
</p><p>
<i>Internet Protocol Address, Domain, and Browser Information</i>
</p><p> 
Our Web server may collect your IP (which stands for Internet Protocol) address, which is the unique number assigned to every computer directly connected to the Internet, often provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Our Web server may also collect the domain you used to access a BGI Site, the type and version of browser and operating system you are using, and the Web site you came from and visit next. This information may be used by us and our business associates to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to a BGI Site in general. We may also use this data to monitor a BGI Site's performance for systems administration purposes, to make a BGI Site easier and more convenient to use and to report information in aggregate form to our advertisers (e.g. how many visitors log in to a BGI Site). We may also use this information to serve you advertising that we think is likely to be more interesting for you and more productive for our advertisers ("targeted advertising"). For example, if you live in British Columbia, we may provide you with ads targeting British Columbia, based upon your IP address if it is associated with a geographically based ISP. 
</p><p>
<i>Cookies </i>
</p><p>
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive, which permit us to recognize your computer when you access a BGI Site. If you are browsing, a cookie is used to help us measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics relating to your use of a BGI Site. This cookie, by itself, doesn't tell us your e-mail address or who you are. We may also use cookies to track aggregate information, such as the number of visitors to BGI Sites, and we may provide this information to third parties such as advertisers, but in such instances this information is disclosed in aggregate format only. 
</p><p>
In some cases, we use cookies to provide you with personalized features. For example, if you personalize your experience on a BGI Site, we store a cookie file on your computer to identify your particular computer and connect it with your chosen personal settings. The cookie file communicates with our server, enabling you to view your personalized version of a BGI Site each time you return to a BGI Site using the same browser.
</p><p> 
Similarly, if a BGI Site is subscription based, or if you otherwise decide to register on-line with us, we may collect additional information to provide you with services, such as maintaining you're chosen portfolio of information, (see Personal Information Collection below). In this case, we use cookies to recognize you on subsequent visits and make your on-line experience more convenient. 
Please note certain features on a BGI Site may not function if you do not accept cookies. 
</p><p>
<i>User-Provided Information</i> 
</p><p>
There are times, such as during a registration or subscription process, when we may ask you for or you may choose to provide information about yourself to assist us in meeting your various needs. To provide certain services, we may ask you to provide, among other things, your name, postal code, e-mail address, and a user name and password ("Registration Information"). At times, we may conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience of our visitors. We may also use information that you provide to us in order to respond to a specific request from you. 
</p><p>

<b>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISTRIBUTION TO THIRD PARTIES</b>
</p><p> 
<i>Generally </i>
</p><p>
There are times when we may ask you for or you may choose to provide information about yourself to assist us in meeting your various needs. This information may be used for the following purposes: answering your questions, providing you with services you have requested, giving producers and developers of a BGI Site information that is useful in determining appropriate new features, content and services, to provide advertisers with aggregate, not individual, information about our customers, informing you of additional services provided by BGI or by our partners, that may interest you, or as otherwise set out in the Terms and Conditions applicable to a BGI Site or BGI Service. 
</p><p>
Personally identifiable information about individual users is not shared with any third parties, except (a) for service providers acting on our behalf solely to enable us to more efficiently provide the services and features offered on a BGI Site, and in such cases, the service providers act under strict contractual controls requiring them to maintain the confidentiality of information and restricting them from accessing or using the information for any purpose other than providing the service for which the information was provided, or (b) as set out in the Terms and Conditions applicable to a BGI Site or BGI Service, to facilitate the provision of the BGI Service, such as, fulfilling legal requirements. 
</p><p>
We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about the visitors to a BGI Site, sales, traffic patterns, and services and provide these statistics to third parties; however, when we do, except as provided in the applicable Terms and Conditions, these statistics will not include any personal information that identifies individuals.
</p><p> 
We may also use, disclose and communicate your personal information in good faith if required to do so by law, including by an order of any court, or in order to protect or defend a legal interest. 
We do not knowingly solicit information from children and we do not knowingly market our services to children. 
</p><p>
Although we use all reasonable means to ensure that the information you provide to us is not used by third parties for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, BGI is not responsible for any improper use of your personal information that is beyond our control. 
</p><p>
<i>Registration/Subscription </i>
</p><p>
In order to have access to a BGI Site or BGI Service we may ask you to register for, and as applicable subscribe to, such BGI Site or BGI Service. In such cases, you will be required to provide certain Registration Information. Once you register for, or subscribe to, a BGI Site or BGI Service, if you later register with another BGI Site or BGI Service, your Registration Information may be shared, for registration purposes only, so that you do not need to completely re-register. 
Your Registration Information is used only to provide requested services to you, for demographic statistics and to display appropriate targeted advertisements. Except as set out in the applicable Terms and Conditions, BGI keeps all of your Personal Information private and does not share it with any third parties. Upon completion of your registration or subscription, we will send you an e-mail containing your user name and useful information regarding the relevant BGI Site and BGI Service. If, during the registration or subscription process, you agreed that you would like us to keep you updated on new BGI Site developments, and information about our BGI Services or about offerings from BGI Sites, we will send you these updates by e-mail. You may choose to unsubscribe to these e-mails at any time by following the instructions at the end of such e-mail message. 
</p><p>
BGI may also send periodic e-mails when necessary to announce important service changes and technical issue updates. 
</p><p>
<i>Surveys </i>
</p><p>
At times, we may conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience of our visitors. You will be given the option to participate in such surveys. Unless you request to receive the results of the survey via e-mail, no information that could identify you personally is requested during such surveys and all information is used on an aggregated basis only. 
</p><p>
<i>Enquiries, Requests and Feedback </i>
</p><p>
We may use information that you provide to us in order to respond to a specific request from you. For example, if you are a user of a particular BGI Service on a BGI Site (such as the Globe Portfolio service or TSN Fantasy Sports services), you have the option of sending your Username to the support staff in order for them to investigate and concerns you may have with your account. By sending us your Username, you are authorizing representatives of BGI to access your portfolio in order to investigate the problem you are reporting. Information provided or gained in this case will be used solely to investigate and address the problem you have reported and will not be shared with any third party. 
</p><p>
We may also provide information that you provide to us in order to improve a BGI Site or BGI Service or to share, in an aggregate format, with advertisers or third party service providers. 
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We retain e-mail addresses of those who communicate via e-mail only for purposes of improving our services or responding to requests. 
</p><p>
<a name="3"></a>   
<b>3. HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED? </b>
</p><p>
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. BGI takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. 
If you provide credit card information to us, we work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We do not reveal any of your credit card number when confirming an order. We transmit the entire credit card number using a secure connection to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
</p><p>
Note that when you register or provide information other than credit card information to us over the Internet, or when you access information you have provided or reports we have created, this information is not secure, and it is technically possible that it could be illicitly or illegally intercepted or monitored while it is being transmitted over the Internet. 
</p><p>
We instruct our employees with access to your Personal Information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. Employees who misuse customer information may be subject to disciplinary action. 
There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your Personal Information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also remember to log out of your account and close your browser window when you finish using a BGI Site or BGI Service or surfing the Web, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information. 
</p><p>
<a name="4"></a>   
<b>4. WHAT IF WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY? </b>
</p><p>
BGI reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to add to, remove, modify or otherwise change any part of this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, in whole or in part, at any time. Changes will be effective when notice of such change is posted at a BGI Site. Please check this Privacy Policy regularly for updates by checking the date of "Last Update" at the top of this document. If any change is not acceptable to you, you must discontinue your use of a BGI Site and BGI Service immediately and you may cancel your registration or subscription, if applicable. Your continued use of a BGI Site or BGI Service after any such changes are posted will constitute acceptance of those changes. Further, BGI reserves the right to change, modify, suspend or discontinue any aspect of a BGI Site or BGI Service from time to time without notice or liability and for any reason whatsoever.
</p><p> 
<a name="5"></a>
<b>5. WEB SITE LINKS</b>
</p><p> 
A BGI Site may contain links to other Web sites, including those of our business partners, vendors, advertisers, and other business associates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other Web sites.
</p><p> 
<a name="6"></a>
<b>6. ADDITIONAL PRIVACY PROCEDURES</b>
</p><p> 
Privacy procedures specific to a BGI Service can be found on a BGI Site at the location of the particular BGI Service, or in additional terms referenced at such BGI Site. Those procedures are an addendum to this policy, and are provided to you at the place where they will be of most use to you.
</p><p> 
<a name="7"></a>
<b>7. HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION? </b>
</p><p>
BGI provides you with the means to access, update, edit or delete the Registration Information you have provided to us at any time on your own by going to the appropriate page in the registration section, and changing or deleting the Registration Information as desired. If you are unsure whether we have a record containing your personal information and would like to confirm whether or not we do, please send an e-mail to the Privacy Manager at generalinfo@bgmi.ca, indicating all e-mail addresses that you may have given us. 
</p><p>
If you decide at any time that you do not want to receive any updates to which you have subscribed, you may choose to unsubscribe to these e-mails by following the instructions at the end of the message. 
</p><p>
<a name="8"></a>   
<b>8. WHO CAN I CONTACT WITH QUESTIONS, COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS?</b>
</p><p> 
In order to continually monitor and strengthen our privacy procedure, we have on staff a Privacy Manager who can be contacted at generalinfo@bgmi.ca. Please contact the Privacy Manager if you have questions about this Privacy Policy or BGI practices that were not answered here. 
</p><p>
We welcome any suggestions about our Privacy Policy. If at any time you believe that BGI has not adhered to this Privacy Policy, please notify us by e-mail at generalinfo@bgmi.ca and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.
