      <p align="justify"><strong>3. Registration</strong><br>
        All required information is used to provide users with services on our site
        
        for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide
        
        location information (such as home and work addresses), but encouraged so
        
        we can provide a more personalised experience on our site and services.</p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>4. Cookies</strong><br>
            <strong>4.1 </strong>A cookie is a small file that your web browser places
        
        on your computer's hard drive to store information. Our site uses cookies to
        
        provide visitors with a personalised experience. We use two types of cookies
        
        on our site. The first kind ensures that once our users log on to the site
        
        and service, they don't have to log in a second time while navigating the site.
        
        These cookies are deleted from your hard disk at the end of each session. The
        
        second kind of cookie is set only at a user's request, and used to save the
        
        email and password one uses to log on to the site and service. It remains on
        
        your hard drive once you have closed your browser. Once the cookie is in place,
        
        we can log you on automatically by accessing this piece of information. Session-based
        
        cookies must be turned on in your browser settings to use the site and service.
        
        To save your email and password, all cookies must be turned on.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>4.2</strong> Some of our business partners may use cookies on our

        We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track users movement,

        are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

        and advertisers. Aggregated demographic information is not linked to any information
        
        that can identify any individual person.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>6.2 </strong>We partner with various third parties to provide specific

        inquiries and with third parties reasonably seeking to enforce their intellectual
        
        property or other legal rights. Moreover, txtNation may (and by using the service
        
        you authorize txtNation to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement

        of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

      <p align="justify"><a href="#">TOP</a></p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>10. Security</strong><br>
            <strong>10.1</strong> txtNation takes every precaution to protect our users'
        
        information. However, we cannot guarantee this and you should not expect, that
        
        personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private
        
        under all circumstances. For example, third parties ("hackers") may
        
        unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or stored information. We do not
        
        assume any responsibility or liability for any information you submit to or
        
        receive from txtNation. We also do not assume any responsibility or liability
        
        for your own or a third party's use or misuse of information transmitted or
        
        received during use of the site or service.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>10.2 </strong>At present, we do not collect sensitive information
        
        such as credit card numbers. At the point in the future that we do so, we will
        
        encrypt that information, and protect it with the best encryption software
        
        in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom
        
        of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
        
        becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>10.3</strong> We also use commercially reasonable efforts to protect
        
        user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive
        
        information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who
        
        need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk
        
        or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
        
        information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security
        
        and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are
        
        added, our employees are reminded about the importance we place on privacy,
        
        and what they must do to ensure our customers' information is protected.</p>

        We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username.
        
        Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services,
        
        special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users,
        
        we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please

        promotional materials from our partners may opt out of receiving these communications
        
        by emailing Technical Support at <a href="mailto:support@txtnation.com">support@txtnation.com</a>.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>12.2 </strong>Users of our site are always notified when their information
        
        is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make

            <strong>14.1</strong> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post
        
        those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information
        
        we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose
        
        it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in
        
        a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify
        
        users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their
        
        information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance
        
        with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>14.2</strong> It is our policy to comply with all applicable laws
        
        and regulations, as they may be modified from time to time. If any portion
