					<div class="copysubhead">Our Policy</div>

					<br>

					Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, TXU does not collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.

					<br>
					<ul>
						<li> required by law;</li>
						<li> we believe it necessary to respond to an inquiry or provide you with a service which you have requested;</li>

						<div class="copysubhead">Our Policy</div>

					<br>

					You are not required to register or provide information to us in order to view much of our site. To obtain services from TXU or subscribe to certain portions of our Web site, such as, but not limited to, TXU’s "Small Business Portal" or other services provided by TXU, you may be asked for personal information.

					TXU will endeavour to take all steps deemed reasonable by TXU to keep secure any information we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up-to-date. Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by TXU.

TXU makes no warranty that the Web site or e-mail correspondence is free from such viruses.
					<br><br>

					<div class="copysubhead">Cookies and Other Information</div>

					<br>

					Like many companies, we may from time to time use "cookie" technology on our Web site.
