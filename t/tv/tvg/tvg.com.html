<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">Protecting your privacy, along with financial transactions, is at the core of TVG's business. This notice describes the type of personally identifiable information we collect and how we use such information. </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">TYPE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">We collect, retain and use information about you to protect and administer your account and funds; to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations; and to help us design, improve and provide products and services in order to better serve you. When you subscribe as a TVG customer or when you submit a request or electronically pass information to TVG, you are sometimes asked to provide certain information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone numbers, social security number, birth date, credit card or bank account information. We ask for this in order to facilitate your requests, provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. Without your written or electronic consent, we will not collect personal information over our system unless it is necessary to provide you with our services or to prevent unauthorized access to our services. </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">You have chosen to do business with us, and we recognize our obligation to keep the information you provide to us secure and confidential. In our continuous effort to provide services that we believe you may find useful or of value, we may make your records available to better facilitate your requests, provide more personalized services and communicate separately with you. From time to time, we will use the information we collect to coordinate data entry and payments with the company that provides you with handicapping information, to coordinate marketing/rewards programs with partner racetracks, and to offer other enhancements to the service. Any third party receiving such information will have an obligation to hold it confidential. Without your written or electronic consent or where necessary to provide our services, we will not disclose your personally identifiable data to other companies outside of TVG or our affiliated companies. TVG does not currently sell customer information to advertisers or third party marketers. If we choose to do so in the future, we will provide you with information about how to remove your name from such lists. You will be provided with at least thirty (30) days within which to remove your name from such lists. If you would prefer that we not share any of your information with third parties, except under the circumstances where we are legally required, please contact us in writing at TVG Network, 19545 NW Von Neumann Drive, Suite 210, Beaverton, OR 97006-6935 to this effect. In circumstances where we inadvertently obtain information that appears to pertain to the commission of a crime or where we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person exists, TVG may voluntarily disclose the record or the contents of your communications or other information about you to law enforcement agencies and governmental entities without providing you advance notice. Upon receipt of an applicable search warrant or administrative, grand jury or trial subpoena, TVG may be required to disclose to the government or law enforcement agencies, without advance notice to you, the content of your communications and other records relating to your electronic communications, as well as the following records: your name and address; records of your online communication (including session times and duration); how long you have subscribed to our service(s) (including start date) and the type(s) of service(s) utilized; your telephone number or other subscriber account identifying number(s), including any Internet or network address(es) assigned to you by our network; and the means and source of your payment(s) (including any credit card or bank account number). </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">PROTECTING ONLINE ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">When you apply online to establish an account, access services or utilize online wagering, you provide personal and confidential information that is necessary for us to process your request. To ensure that your information remains confidential, the information is sent to us in a "secure session." Using the industry standard, Secure Socket Layer (SSL)-capable web browsers support encryption technology that helps prevent unauthorized users from viewing or manipulating your account information as it travels over the Internet. We will permit only authorized parties, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our privacy policy will be subject to our disciplinary process. </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">RETENTION </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">We destroy customer information that is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it is collected unless there is a legitimate request or order to inspect the information still outstanding or the information remains in routine records that are periodically discarded under our document retention policies. The information that you have provided us is maintained in our management information system and billing systems, and is updated as new information is added. Accounting and billing records are retained for ten years for tax and accounting purposes or until the relevant income tax years for which the document was created have been closed for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted. Records may remain on file even after you have terminated service. Subject to applicable law, we may also keep records to facilitate collection and to evaluate credit worthiness. </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">It is extremely important that you keep your account number, Personal Identification Number and other confidential account data protected and secure. Do not share your PIN or leave your computer unattended during an online wagering session. Please make sure that all information you provide to TVG is accurate and complete. Contact us immediately by email at comments@tvg.com, or by calling 1-888-PLAY-TVG if you find any discrepancies in your account data or if you wish to inspect the records pertaining to you at our offices. </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">THIRD PARTY WEB SITES </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">TVG's website contains links to other sites. TVG cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites. When linking to other sites, please review their security and privacy policies. </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">RESPONSIBLE WAGERING </span></p>
<p>
	<span class="eightptarial">TVG is a recognized leader in the area of responsible wagering. TVG does not solicit any information from or market our services to anyone under the age of 21. National Gambling Helpline: 1-800-522-4700 We reserve the right to revise this policy, or any part thereof.
