</p>
<p class="f"><a name="infosharing"></a><b>Information sharing</b>

</p>
<p class="f">Tv-links.eu only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Tv-links.eu in the following limited circumstances:
</p>

<ul><font size="-1">
<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
</li></font><li><font size="-1">We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.

</li><li><font size="-1">We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,  (b) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (c) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Tv-links.eu, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</font>
</li></ul>

<p class="f">If Tv-links.eu becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
</p>
<p class="f">We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.

</p>
<p class="f">Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.
</p>
<p class="f"><a name="infosecurity"></a><b>Information security</b>
</p>
<p class="f">We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
</p>
<p class="f">We restrict access to personal information to Tv-links.eu employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
</p>
<p class="f"><a name="dataintegrity"></a><b>Data integrity</b>
</p>
<p class="f">Tv-links.eu processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services.

</p>
<p class="f"><a name="access"></a><b>Accessing and updating personal information</b>

</p>
<p class="f">When you use Tv-links.eu services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.
