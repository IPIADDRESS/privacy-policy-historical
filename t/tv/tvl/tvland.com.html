These 

Additional 

Privacy Statements, if any, shall be provided to you in conjunction with those products and services and are hereby incorporated in this Privacy Policy by

<br><br>




	
	
	
	</dd><dd><b>3.2 	Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</b><br><br>

The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons", Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, 
"<u>Tracking

Technologies</u>") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web. "<u>Cookies</u>" are typically html or browser-based text 
or other 

files (and 

often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences and/or user activity. "<u>Web beacons</u>" (also known as image tags, 
gif, 

tracking pixels 

or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Flash local shared objects 

("<u>LSOs</u>") 

(sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.<br><br>

These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's 

webpages, 

type of browser use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, 

applications or interactive services. Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and 

other 

websites, applications or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned to any Device(s) and/or 

Device and 

Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-

Internet 

browser combination you use to access the Site ("<u>Identifier</u>"). For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer 
on 

Firefox, or 

access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal Information is not 

collected as 

part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with 

your 

Personal Information (such as your Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or third 

parties.<br><br>

</dd><dd><b>3.2.1	The Site's Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information</b><br><br>

By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving us your consent to track your activities 

and your 

use of the Site and other websites, applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the 

emails we 

send to you. See Your Choices section below for more information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes.<br><br>

We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in "<a href="#4.2" target="_parent"><b><u>Section 4.2 Other 
Information 

Collected by us</u></b></a>" 

under "How Is Collected Information Used" below. For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you from seeing the same 

advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, 

email 

marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.<br><br>

</dd><dd><b>3.2.2	Third Parties' Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information</b><br>
This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, 

traffic 

or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<u>Third Party Service 
Providers</u>") to, 

for 

example, facilitate personalized advertisements ("<u>Customized Advertising</u>") and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and 
analyze 

advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site. Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you 

for 

products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services you 

have 

visited.<br><br>

Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device 

subject to 

your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see "<b><u>Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers</u></b>" section below 
and "<b><u>More 

Information on 

Managing Tracking Technologies</u></b>" section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities 
over time 

and 

across different websites when you use the Site.<br><br>

We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. For example, to the extent necessary to 

provide

mean that you shall no longer receive online ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are 

automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing 

habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more 

frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party

longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, enabling Single VII Sign-

On, saving your player settings or other purposes described in <a href="4.2" target="_parent"><b><u>"Other Information Collected By Us"</u></b></a> above,

</li><li><b>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</b> Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser 
communicates. 

Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be 

transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting 

organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.<br>

We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond 

to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we 

follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms 

described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

email to 

the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration 

and may 

provide or request additional information (for example, requesting that the Parent provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal 

guardian of the 

child or Ineligible Teenager) before terminating the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and, upon or prior to termination, may notify the child or 

Ineligible
