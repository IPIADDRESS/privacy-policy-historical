<p>
Last modified on February 21, 2008 and is effective immediately.
</p>
<p> 
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY DESCRIBE YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
</p>

<p>
This is the official Terms of Use Agreement ("<u>Agreement</u>") for tvland.com ("<u>Site</u>"), an Internet website offered in cooperation with the TV Land television channel ("<u>TV Land Channel</u>"). The TV Land Channel and tvland.com (together, "<u>TV Land</u>," "<u>we</u>," "<u>us</u>," or "<u>our</u>"), are provided by MTV Networks ("<u>MTVN</u>"), a division of Viacom International Inc. (together with MTVN, the "<u>Parent Companies</u>"). This Agreement governs only the content, features, and activities related to this Site and does not cover MTVN's "Jobhunt" website or the websites for any other MTVN programming channels, the Parent Companies, any subsidiaries or affiliates of TV Land and the Parent Companies ("<u>Affiliates</u>"), or any other company, unless specifically stated.
</p>
<p>
This Site is offered and made available only to users 14 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions ("<u>U.S.</u>"). <b>If you are not yet 14 years old, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if for any reason, you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, please discontinue using the Site immediately because by using or attempting to use the Site, you certify that you are at least 14 years of age and meet any other eligibility and residency requirements of the Site.</b> 
</p>
<p>
These terms and conditions regarding your use of the Site constitute a legally binding agreement between you and TV Land and the Parent Companies. In this Agreement, the term "Site" includes all websites and web pages within the Site as well as any equivalent, mirror, replacement, substitute or backup websites and web pages that are associated with the Site. By using this Site, you understand, acknowledge and agree that you will abide by the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms that govern certain products and services, which will be presented in conjunction with those products and services ("<u>Additional Terms</u>") including, but not limited to, the <a href="submission_agreement.jhtml">User Content Submission Agreement</a> which governs your submission of User Content (as such term is defined therein). The Site may also provide rules of participation ("<u>Rules</u>") for certain activities and services including, but not limited to, contests and sweepstakes, award programs, membership clubs, email, and dating services. The Site's Additional Terms and the <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and the Rules are hereby incorporated in this Agreement by reference. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and Additional Terms for the activity in which you choose to participate, the Additional Terms shall govern. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and the specific Rules for the activity in which you choose to participate, the Rules shall govern. This Agreement will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and in the event of termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still be bound by your obligations under this Agreement, the <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and any Additional Terms or Rules, including any indemnifications, warranties and limitations of liability. 
</p>
<p>
The words "<u>use</u>" or "<u>using</u>" in this Agreement means any time an individual (a "<u>user</u>"), directly or indirectly, with or without the aid of a machine or device, does or attempts to access, interact with, use, display, view, print or copy from the Site, transmit, receive or exchange data or communicate with the Site, or in any way utilizes, benefits, takes advantage of or interacts with any function, service or feature of the Site, for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement does not cover your rights or responsibilities with respect to third party content or sites or any links that may direct your browser or your connection to third party sites or pages. This is the entire and exclusive Agreement between you and us regarding use of the Site and it cannot be modified, except as specifically described below in <u>Section 2</u>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>1. REGISTRATION</b><br>
We may require each user to have a unique user name and password combination in order to access and use certain features or functions of the Site and may also, from time to time, provide users with additional codes or passwords necessary to access and use certain features or functions of the Site. Please read our <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes the personally identifiable information ("<u>Personal Information</u>") we collect, use, disclose, manage and store. As part of the registration process for the feature or function, you will choose a user name and password (or we may assign an initial password which we will give you the option to change). Your user name and password are personal to you and you may not allow any others to use your user name or password under any circumstances. We are not liable for any harm caused or related to the theft or misappropriation of your user name or password, disclosure of your user name or password, or your authorization of anyone else to use your user name or password. You agree to immediately notify us if you become aware of or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of (or activity using) your user name or password or any other need to deactivate your user name or password due to security concerns. 
</p>
<p>
<b>2. MODIFICATIONS</b><br>
We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in our sole discretion, to change the terms of this Agreement. We will post or display notices of material changes on the Site and/or e-mail you or notify you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. Once we post them on the Site, these changes become effective immediately and if you use the Site after they become effective, it will signify your agreement to be bound by the changes. You should check back frequently and review the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the User Content Submission Agreement, other Additional Terms, Rules and Privacy Policy, regularly so you are aware of the most current rights and obligations that apply to you and the terms and conditions of your agreement with us. 
</p>
<p>
<b>3. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</b><br>
The contents of this Site, including all Site software, design, text, images, photographs, illustrations, audio and video material, artwork, graphic material, databases, proprietary information and all copyrightable or otherwise legally protectible elements of the Site, including, without limitation, the selection, sequence and 'look and feel' and arrangement of items, and all trademarks, service marks and trade names (individually and/or collectively, the "<u>Material</u>"), are the property of the Parent Companies, and their Affiliates, and any of their successors and assigns, and any of their respective licensors, Advertisers (as defined below), suppliers, and operational service providers and are legally protected, without limitation, under U.S. Federal and State, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and treaties. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise or we explicitly say so in writing, the term "Site" includes "Material" as well. The Site is to be used solely for your noncommercial, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable and limited personal use and for no other purposes. You must not alter, delete or conceal any copyright or other notices contained on the Site, including notices on any Material you download, transmit, display, print or reproduce from the Site. You shall not, nor will you allow any third party (whether or not for your benefit) to reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, display, perform, publish, distribute, disseminate, broadcast or circulate to any third party (including, without limitation, on or via a third party website), or otherwise use, any Material without the express prior written consent of MTVN or its owner if MTVN is not the owner. Any unauthorized or prohibited use of any Material may subject you to civil liability, criminal prosecution, or both, under applicable federal, state and local laws. We require users to respect our copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. We likewise respect the intellectual property of others. On notice, we will act expeditiously to remove content on the Site that infringes the copyright rights of others and will disable the access to the Site and its services of anyone who uses them to repeatedly infringe the intellectual property rights of others. 
</p>
<p>
We take protection of copyrights, both our own and others, very seriously. We therefore employ multiple measures to prevent copyright infringement over this Site and to promptly end any infringement that might occur. If you believe that the Site contains elements that infringe your copyrights in your work, please follow the procedures set forth in our <a href="/legal/compliancepolicy.jhtml">Copyright Compliance Policy</a>.

<b>4. ADVERTISING</b><br>

All such communications, interactions and participation is strictly and solely between you and such Advertisers and we shall not be responsible or liable to you in any way in connection with these activities or transactions (including, without limitation, any representations, warranties, covenants, contracts or other terms or conditions that may exist between you and the Advertisers or any goods or services you may purchase or obtain from any Advertisers). 
</p>
<p>
<b>5. RULES OF CONDUCT</b><br>

<p>
<b>6. SHOPPING</b><br>
All goods and services offered for sale on the Site ("<u>Products</u>") are guaranteed by the manufacturer, licensor or distributor against defects in material and workmanship for 30 days from the date of the invoice. Within that time period, just contact Customer Service (see contact information on the applicable e-commerce page) and we will coordinate attempting to correct, repair or replace the defective Product or, if applicable, in obtaining a refund for you. We have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for goods or services you may obtain from or through other websites or web pages, even if you were directed or linked to such a site or page through the Site, nor are we responsible for assisting you in correcting any problem you may experience with Products if you do not notify us within the 30 day period noted above or for any goods or services not obtained directly on the Site. You agree that your sole and exclusive remedy and our sole, exclusive and maximum liability arising from or relating in any way to any Product shall be the amount you actually paid us (or our suppliers, operational service providers, or other e-commerce partners) for it. <b>EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY AND ALL PRODUCTS. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY MADE IN WRITING, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY AND EVERY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</b> 
</p>
<p>
Products may be purchased while supplies last. If a Product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel orders placed for that Product, whether or not the order has been confirmed and even if your account has been charged (in which event we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge). 
</p>
<p>
Our creation or transmission of an order confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order, nor constitute a binding confirmation of an offer to sell any Product and we reserve the right to accept or decline your order for any reason up until the time the Product is actually delivered to you. We reserve the right at any time, without prior notice, to limit or reduce the quantity you ordered of any Product and we will notify you if we do so. All orders placed over $500.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and authorization policies and practices in effect at the time of your order. We may contact you and require additional information from you before we grant such pre-approval. Products on the Site are offered for sale only to end user customers or as personal gifts to end user customers and not for resale. We do not knowingly accept orders from dealers, exporters, wholesalers, distributors, resellers or other similar persons or companies, and reserve the right to refuse, cancel or seek the return of any Products that are purchased in violation of the foregoing restrictions. 
</p>
<p>
You are responsible for any taxes imposed on the sale or use of Products and applicable taxes will be added to the amount charged for Products purchased on the Site. If an order consists of multiple items, they may be shipped separately depending on availability. 
</p>
<p>
<b>7. WIRELESS MARKETING SERVICES AND PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES</b><br> 
TV Land may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones. Users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from TV Land, either by registering on this Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies or Affiliates for TV Land. The information requested as part of the online registration process is a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Optional information may be requested for specific promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, or other similar survey information. Depending on the promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to the Site's <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and Terms of Use Agreement. 
</p>
<p>
Users that register for TV Land's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from TV Land. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will TV Land, the Parent Companies or any Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address</b>. 
</p>
<p>
A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that TV Land may, at its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. TV Land may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.

<p>
This is the official privacy policy ("<u>Privacy Policy</u>") for tvland.com ("<u>Site</u>"), an Internet website offered in cooperation with the TV Land television channel ("<u>TV Land Channel</u>"). The TV Land Channel and tvland.com (together, "<u>TV Land</u>," "<u>we</u>," "<u>us</u>," or "<u>our</u>") are provided by MTV Networks ("<u>MTVN</u>"), a division of Viacom International Inc. (together with MTVN, the "<u>Parent Companies</u>"). This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("<u>Personal Information</u>") collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by MTVN's "Jobhunt" website or the websites for any other MTVN programming channels, the Parent Companies, any subsidiaries or affiliates of TV Land and the Parent Companies ("<u>Affiliates</u>"), or any other company, unless specifically stated. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Overview: This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site and how that information is collected;</li> 
<li>How we use your Personal Information; </li>
<li>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties; </li>
<li>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>
<li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
This Site is offered and made available only to users 14 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions ("<u>U.S.</u>"). <b>If you are not yet 14 years old, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information</b>. This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a href="#terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> . Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings given in the Terms of Use Agreement. Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users. 
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site's homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates. 
</p>
<p>
We are committed to protecting users' privacy. Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information. 
</p>
<p>
</p><center><h4>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h4></center>
<p></p>
<p>
If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "<u>unsubscribe</u>") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. 
</p>
<p>
TV Land qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. 
</p>
<p>
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:community@tvland.com">community@tvland.com</a> , or you may contact us via regular mail at:

<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities:</b> We may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from us, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by Affiliates for us. The Personal Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Optional information may be requested for specific promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services and other similar survey information. Depending on the promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. 
</p>
<p>
We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.
</p>
<p>
Users that register for our wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from us. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will TV Land, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</b> 
</p>
<p class="indent_text">
<b>a. Registration.</b> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for our wireless marketing services. Standard rate promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at our discretion depending on the type of promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.
<br><br>
</p><p class="indent_text_a">
<b>1)	Single Opt-in Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to us will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to us to send text messages to him or her. We will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from us or by sending a text message to us that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". 
<br><br>
<b>2)	Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to the Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to our sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by us) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="#terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> before the online registration process is completed. We will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from us to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of our wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time <u>provided</u> <u>that</u> we may choose to terminate offering the wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while we continue to offer the specific wireless marketing service.
<br><br>
<b>3)	Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. We will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from us to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of our wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that we may choose to terminate offering the wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while we continue to offer the specific wireless marketing service. 
</p>
<p class="indent_text">
<b>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User.</b> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from us by the following procedure: 
<br><br>
A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by us at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". We will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with us. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of our service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.
<br><br>
<b>c. Termination of Wireless Services by Us.</b> User understands, acknowledges and agrees that we may, in our sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate our offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. We may provide notices of termination or changes in services on the Site.
<br><br>
<b>d. Use of Information.</b> We will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Personal Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share such Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy and Confidentiality:</b> It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. <b>We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or Personal Information or you fail to update such information or Personal Information.</b>

<b>a. Co-Branded Services and Features.</b> The Site may also offer co-branded services and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another company or our Affiliates ("<u>Co-Branded Partner</u>"). Such services and features may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded Partner to collect and use your Personal Information provided during the registration process and/or in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes.

<b>b.

We will refer to these third parties as "<u>operational service providers</u>". We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with TV Land.

</li><li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates. 
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information:</b> We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy. 
</p>
<p>
<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phishing:</b> Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use ‘spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. <b>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</b> If you receive any such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:community@tvland.com">community@tvland.com</a> , and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="section99">9.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information:</b> Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site.

Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 14 years old.
</p>
<p>
Children under the age of 14, or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site ("<u>Ineligible Teenagers</u>"), that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the <a href="#terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> . Parents (including legal guardians) of children or Ineligible Teenagers that registered on the Site in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and select "EDIT ACCOUNT" or alternatively, you can send us an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID (please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account). If a parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child or Ineligible Teenager. We will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. We will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. 
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries. 
</p>
<p>
<b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contact Me" or Similar Type Function:</b> In connection with certain activities and services offered on the Site, we may from time to time include a "contact me" or similar type function (e.g., if you create a profile page on the Site, we may include a "contact me" link on your profile page which would enable web users to e-mail you at your personal e-mail account). By registering for the Site, you have affirmatively consented to receiving e-mails (if any) at your personal e-mail account via a "contact me" or similar type function. Should a web user send you an e-mail via a "contact me" or similar type function on the Site, your e-mail address will not be revealed to such user at the time the e-mail is sent. <b>HOWEVER, IF YOU RECEIVE AN E-MAIL IN YOUR PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO RESPOND TO SUCH E-MAIL, THEN YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS WILL BE REVEALED TO THE RECIPIENT OF YOUR E-MAIL (IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS WOULD BE REVEALED IN ANY E-MAIL YOU SEND TO ANYONE FROM YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT). IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO REVEAL YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO THE E-MAIL SENT TO YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT</b>. In order to withdraw your consent to receive e-mails at your personal e-mail account via a "contact me" or similar type function, you will need to deactivate your account on the Site by following the procedures set forth in <u>Section 13</u> of the "Terms of Use Agreement" labeled "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use".
