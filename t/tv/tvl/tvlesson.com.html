        Notice</span><br>
        Updated as of February 1, 2007<br>
        To understand how we treat the information you give us as you use 
        TVLesson, you should read this policy.<br><br>
        <b>Personal Information</b><br>
        • Non-Account Activity. You can watch videos on TVLesson without having 
        a TVLesson Account. You can also contact us about a particular video 
        without having a TVLesson Account.<br>
        • Account-Related Activity. Certain other activities on TVLesson—like 
        uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or watching 
        restricted videos—require you to have a TVLesson. We ask for some 
        personal information when you create a TVLesson Account, including your 
        email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from 
        unauthorized access. <br>
        • Usage Information. We may record information about your usage, such as 
        when you use TVLesson, the channels, groups, and favorites you subscribe 
        to, the contacts you communicate with, the videos you watch, and the 
        frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display 
        or click on in TVLesson (including UI elements, settings, and other 
        information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information 
        with your account. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in 
        HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by 
        recipients.<br>
        • Content Uploaded to Site. Any personal information or video content 
        that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages 
        and chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes 
        publicly available and can be collected and used by others.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><br>
        <b>Uses<br>
        </b>• If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the 
        TVLesson Sites, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, 
        and provide to you the general and personalized features and 
        functionality of the TVLesson Sites, and to process any flagging 
        activity or correspondence you send to us.<br>
        • Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users 
        when you upload videos or send messages through the TVLesson Sites and 
        other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos 
        that you submit to the TVLesson Sites may be redistributed through the 
        internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general 
        public. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users may see that 
        you, as identified by your account name (not your email address), are 
        watching the same video.<br>
        • We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable 
        information to send commercial or marketing messages without your 
        consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you 
        will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your 
        email address without further consent for non-marketing or 
        administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major TVLesson Site 
        changes or for customer service purposes).<br>
        • We use both your personally identifiable information and certain 
        non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage 
        data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to 
        improve the quality and design of the TVLesson Sites and to create new 
        features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, 
        analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user 
        activity and communications.<br>
        • We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store 
        information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit 
        or the next time you visit the TVLesson Sites; (b) provide custom, 
        personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of 
        our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total 
        number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, 
        submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. If you 
        download the TVLesson Uploader, your copy of the of the Uploader 
        includes a unique application number. The unique application number and 
        information about your installation of the Uploader (e.g. version 
        number, language) will be sent to TVLesson when the Uploader 
        automatically checks for updates.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><br>
        <b>Your Choices<br>
        </b>• You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable 
        information through the TVLesson Sites, in which case you can still view 
        videos and explore the TVLesson Sites, but TVLesson may not be able to 
        provide certain services to you. The privacy notices of those services 
        govern the use of your personal information associated with them.<br>
        • You may update or correct your personal profile information and email 
        preferences at any time.<br>
        • You may clear your viewing history at any time through the "Viewing 
        History" feature.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><br>
        <b>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</b><br>
        TVLesson allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad 
        networks, to serve advertisements within the TVLesson Sites. These 
        third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly 
        to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the 
        TVLesson Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this 
        happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, 
        JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their 
        advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
        TVLesson does not provide any personally identifiable information to 
        these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or 
        except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have 
        the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an 
        advertiser asks TVLesson to show an advertisement to a certain audience 
        (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 
        18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to 
        that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you 
        fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The 
        advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the TVLesson 
        Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any 
        personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver 
        to you.<br>
        You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party 
        ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on 
        their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain 
        practices. TVLesson's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot 
        control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
