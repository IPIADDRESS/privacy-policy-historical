<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva">We created
the following privacy policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for your
right to privacy.<o:p>

<p><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva">What
Information is Collected</span></u></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva"><br>
TVEyes users enter email addresses and keywords of their choice for the purpose

<p><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva">Confidentiality</span></u></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva"><br>
TVEyes does not provide individually identifiable information to third parties
except as noted under “Limits of Confidentiality”. TVEyes uses proprietary
technologies to preserve the anonymity of users while matching their interests
with targeted information sent via email. TVEyes will under no circumstance
reveal any user’s identity to marketers. It is solely at a TVEyes user’s
discretion if he or she chooses to provide personally identifiable information
to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or
communicating directly with the company or organization after visiting its web
site.<o:p>

<p><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva">Limits
of Confidentiality</span></u></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva"><br>
Due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we may be forced
to disclose individually identifiable information to third parties. We will use
our best efforts to limit disclosure to only these circumstances where necessary
by contract, legal process, or the technical operation of the service.<o:p>
</o:p>

<p><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva">Use of
Information</span></u></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva"><br>
A TVEyes user’s email address will only be used by TVEyes to periodically
contact that user about user-selected interests.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva">TVEyes uses
incoming and outgoing website traffic data to help diagnose problems with our
server and to administer our website. We also use it to gather broad demographic
information about our users in general. We may combine demographic information
supplied by a user at registration time with site usage data to provide
profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences as it relates
to the TVEyes Network.<o:p>
