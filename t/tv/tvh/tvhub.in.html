<div><p>By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of tvhub.in. If you do not agree to the Policy, please do not use this site. tvhub.in reviews, its privacy policy periodically and reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify or remove portions of this policy at any time. This page should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. If you want to communicate with us about our policy, please e-mail us at tvhub.in@gmail.com</p>
<p>tvhub.in, which operates the Internet site located at tvhub.in recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to our sites. As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or email address, is automatically collected from visitors to our site. Personally identifiable information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. We may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites. In those instances when we do collect personally identifiable information, the following policies apply: tvhub.in will notify you when we are collecting personally identifiable information about you and how we intend to use it. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with the information you requested, in connection with entry forms, or in connection with community postings such as chat and bulletin boards.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Such other uses may include sending you information or materials we think you will find interesting, or sharing the information with tvhub.in's Media's advertisers and reputable business partners. However, at the time of collection, you will have the option of instructing us not to send you additional information or share your personal information with third parties. tvhub.in is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of our business partners. tvhub.in may use reputable third parties to manage activities available on our sites including, but not limited to statistical analysis, or chats.

In most instances, tvhub.in instructs these third parties to use personally identifiable information only for the specific purpose for which it is collected, and not to sell, market or transfer such information to other entities. If tvhub.in obtains personal information that has been collected from you by a third party, including our business partners, this Privacy Policy nonetheless governs tvhub.in's use of that information.

Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to divulge any personal information.

Also, tvhub.in may reveal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.tvhub.in maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of personally identifiable information submitted to our site, and periodically reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies.
