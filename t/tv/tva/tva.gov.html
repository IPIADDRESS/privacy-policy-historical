  <h1>TVA Privacy Policy  </h1>
  <h2>Overview of Privacy</h2>
  <p class="body">Thank you for visiting the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Web sites and reviewing our privacy policy. The privacy of visitors to our site is important to us. This statement informs you of how we use personal information that may be collected, used, and stored when you visit TVA on the Web. Our Privacy Policy is subject to change and updates, so you are encouraged to review the policy from time to time.</p>
  <h2>Automatic Collection of Information</h2>
  <p class="body">When you visit our Web site, we automatically collect some general, anonymous information about your visit to help us improve navigation on our site or investigate disruption of service attacks. This information includes: the date and time of your visit; an Internet Protocol (IP) address; the browser software and operating system used for your visit; and the content of any sent or received cookie(s). This information is technical in nature, is not used to identify who you are, and is collected in the aggregate for statistical purposes. </p>
  <h2>Personal Information That You Voluntarily Provide</h2>
  <p class="body">You do not have to provide any personal information to us to access information on our websites. If you choose to provide us with personal information, such as by sending a message to an e-mail address on this website or by filling out a form and submitting it through our website, we will use that information to respond to your message or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.</p>
  <h2>How the Information is Used</h2>
  <p class="body">We may store non-personally identifiable information we collect indefinitely to help us better understand and meet the needs of our visitors. By sending us an electronic mail message (for example, by sending us an e-mail message, taking our Energy Online Evaluation, applying for a career at TVA, or subscribing to any of our e-mail alert services), you may be sending us personally-identifying information, such as name and address. In these cases, we may retain the information as long as necessary to respond to your request or otherwise resolve the subject matter of your e-mail. Please be aware that email is not necessarily secure from third party interception or misdirection. For your own protection you may wish to communicate sensitive information using a method other than e-mail.</p>
  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p class="body">We may share the information we collect from and about you with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, e-mail, analytics providers, web hosting providers, payment processors, web applications, or data enhancement provider) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.</p>
  <h2>Cookie Use and Traffic Data</h2>
  <p class="body">Website measurement and customization technologies (commonly called “cookies") are small bits of text that are downloaded to your internet browser when you visit a website. The Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-10-22, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf">Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies</a> defines conditions under which Federal agencies may use session and persistent cookies. TVA Web sites may use cookies; however, cookies set by or on behalf of TVA do not collect personal information about you, but only about your browser "session." This non-personal information is not disclosed to third parties and may be retained by TVA for Web site improvement and customization purposes, in compliance with TVA's policies for privacy and data safeguarding.</p>
  <p class="body"> You can set your computer to reject (i.e. "opt out" of) cookies, and you will still be able to access all of the informational resources provided on our sites. However, some of the customized and dynamic features may not function properly or as efficiently. To learn more about how to opt out of cookies, please click here: <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml">http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml</a>.</p>
  <h2>Individuals’ Access to their Data</h2>
  <p class="body">The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government keeps on individuals in Systems of Records (SOR). Please note that the Privacy Act does not cover all information collected online. More detailed information concerning the Privacy Act, including a listing of TVA Systems of Records Notices (SORNs), can be found at: <a href="/foia/sysofrecords.htm">http://www.tva.com/foia/sysofrecords.htm</a>.</p>
  <h2>Social Networking</h2>
  <p class="body">In order to encourage greater public participation, collaboration, and transparency, TVA currently maintains official Corporation accounts on commercial social networks sites, including YouTube, LinkedIn, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter. TVA does not collect, maintain, or disseminate information posted by visitors to these sites. Additionally, the Corporation does not endorse or control the comments or opinions provided by visitors to these sites. Please note that the TVA Privacy Policy does not extend to, or have authority over, the privacy policy of any commercial social networking sites you may visit. Therefore, if you choose to interact with the TVA on a commercial third-party site, please review carefully the privacy policy of the third party.

  <h2>Children Online</h2>
  <p class="body">TVA recognizes the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.

If you become aware that such information has been provided by a child under 13, please use the Contact Information below to submit a request to delete theinformation.</p>

You will be notified when you access one of these links, warning you that you are leaving the official TVA web site. Once you access another site through a link that we provide, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site. For more information, please visit TVA’s <a href="/abouttva/link_policy.htm">External Link Policy</a>.</p>
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p class="body">This government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause disruption or damage. Such attempts are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.</p>
