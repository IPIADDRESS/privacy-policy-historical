					    </p>
														<p>TV One, LLC ("TV One") is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of visitors to the website located at http://www.tvoneonline.com (the "Site").  We want to be open and clear about the information that we collect and use from the Site.  Please read this "Privacy Policy" carefully so that you understand the ways in which we do and do not use information from you when you visit this Site.  TV One may revise this Privacy Policy at any time, and such revisions will be effective upon posting.  Accordingly, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy frequently for any updates or changes.  From time to time, we may also email you about material revisions to our Privacy Policy. </p>
														<p><strong>INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT DO NOT RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES OR THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN THIRTEEN (13) YEARS OLD</strong></p>
														<p>This Site is a general audience site and is intended for users (a) that reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions (the "United States.") and (b) that are thirteen (13) years of age or older.  If you are not resident of the United States, you understand that your use of the Site constitutes consent to be governed by United States laws regarding the privacy and use of personally identifiable information (as defined below).  If you are under 13, YOU MUST get permission from your parents before sending any information about yourself (including personally identifiable information like your name, email addresses, or phone numbers) over the Internet, to TV One or to anyone else.  TV One will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide personally identifiable information. </p>
														<p><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
														<p>Under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83, California residents may request certain information regarding the disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.  However, a company may elect to post and adhere to a privacy policy which clearly stipulates how individuals may opt-in or opt-out of the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information.  TV One provides California residents the option to opt-in or opt-out of the disclosure of personally identifiable information for direct marketing purposes and encourages you to send an email to: <a class="link" href="mailto:privacy@tvoneonline.com">privacy@tvoneonline.com</a> with "CA Privacy Rights" in the re line if you have questions about the choices you have made regarding the disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, or if you have other questions regarding your privacy rights.

													  <p align="center"><strong>GENERAL PRIVACY INFORMATION</strong><br>
						</p>
													  <p><strong>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></p>
														<p>Throughout the Privacy Policy, we use the terms "personally identifiable information" and "information."  When we use the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that is particular to you which includes (but is not limited to) your name, address, email address, phone number, fax number, billing address, shipping address, gender, occupation, age personal interests, password, username, information regarding how you were referred to the website, interest in certain areas or features of the Site, your IP address, or other information that would allow someone to contact or uniquely identify you.  (Your "IP address" is an address associated with the access point through which you enter the Internet and is generally controlled by the Internet Service Provider through which you connect to the Internet.")  When we use the term "information," we mean any data or information that may come from you in whatever manner arising from your visit to the Site—including personally identifiable information. </p>
													  <p><strong>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
														<p>TV One collects information and personally identifiable information in one of two ways.

Our Site also employs cookies (a piece of information that is stored on the hard drive or your computer that identifies you and can be used to understand your preferences regarding the Site) and <strong>web beacons</strong> or <strong>clear gifs</strong> (small pieces of data embedded in a website) to help assist us with maintaining and improving the quality and functionality of our Site.  Additionally, TV One may provide information and content from the Site to personal digital assistants, mobile phones, handheld computers, or other similar devices.

														  <br>
														  <br>
													    Second, TV One may collect information voluntarily which includes (but is not limited to) information supplied by visitors to our Site when they (i) request information about TV One, (ii) respond to specific requests made on the Site; and (iii) use the features of the Site.  TV One expects that you will provide true and accurate information when you are using the Site or providing information voluntarily. </p>
														<p><strong>USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
													  <p>TV One may use information and personally identifiable information in any of the following ways:</p>
														<p>
														  &nbsp;&nbsp;- To provide a visitor with requested information or services<br>
														  <br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;To allow visitors to access to certain features of the Site which may include access to uploading and reviewing photographs, playing videos, creating and reading web logs ("blogs"), posting or reading entries on message boards, or participation in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;To provide access to the Site’s career center and to evaluate and consider your resume and/or other materials associated with an application for employment available to employers registered with the Site<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;To allow purchases or sales via the Site<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;To personalize features of the Site<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;To provide select affiliates, special marketing partners, and other exclusive third parties with whom TV One has a relationship a means by which to contact and market their goods and services to you<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;To enable our service providers to make features of the Site available for your use<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;For any other advertising and promotional purpose<br><br>
					    </p>
														<p><strong>For instructions on how to opt out of the disclosure of personally identifiable information, please click here.</strong></p>
													  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;However, regardless of any opt-out decision that you make, TV One may need to disclose information in order to:</p>
														<p>
														  &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Comply with the state, local, or federal laws of the United States<br>
														  <br>
													     &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other forms of legal process<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Exercise its legal rights or defend itself against claims<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Investigate or address concerns regarding illegal activities, possible fraud, or concerns about the health or physical welfare of any person<br><br>
													    &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Address concerns about violations or potential violations of TV One’s Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Provide a third party information pursuant to the sale or purchase of business or assets<br><br>
													      &nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Act in any manner permitted by law, but consistent with this Privacy Policy<br><br>
						
														</p><p>Unless required by law, TV One WILL NOT disclose your resume, job requirements, or other information related to any application for employment with TV One.</p>
													  <p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF AND REMOVAL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THE SITE </strong></p>
