<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3> 











<p>

Thank you for visiting tnt.turner.com, a Time Warner site.  Your

privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy, we provide

this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices

you can make about the way your information is collected and used at

this Time Warner site.  <b><a href="http://turner.com/legal/appliesto_legal.html">Click here</a></b> for a list of the  businesses

whose sites are governed by this Privacy Notice.</p>



<b><p>The Information We Collect</p> </b> 



<p>

At some Time Warner sites,

you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise

express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online

newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. 

The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected

at these pages include:  name, address, e-mail address, telephone

number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your

interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 

</p>



<p>

At some other Time Warner sites, you can submit information about

other people.  For example, you might submit a person’s name and

e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a

gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit

the recipient’s name and address.  The types of personally

identifiable information that may be collected about other people at

these pages include:  recipient’s name, address, e-mail address,

and telephone number.  

</p>



<p>

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information

when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are

using (<i>e.g., </i>Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating

system you are using, (<i>e.g.</i>, Windows ’95 or Mac OS) and the

domain name of your Internet service provider (<i>e.g., </i>America

Online, Earthlink).

</p>



<b><p>How We Use the Information</p> </b> 



<p>

We may use the information

you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products,

programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our

offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we

believe may be of interest to you. 

</p>



<p>

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to

notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes

to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online

newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.

</p>



<p>

We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to

send them your gifts or cards.  From time to time, we also may use this

information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.  

</p>



<p>

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and

communities is used to provide an interactive experience.  We use this

information to facilitate participation in these online forums and

communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or

services.

</p>



<p>

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we

collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us

to personalize your Internet experience.  We also may use this

information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer

you products, programs, or services.  

</p>



<p>

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by

law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.  We also

may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement

agency’s request.

</p>



<p>

Agents and contractors of Time Warner who have access to personally

identifiable information are required to protect this information in a

manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not

using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the

services they are performing for Time Warner.

</p>



<p>

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against

unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that

personally identifiable information that we collect will never be

disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. 

Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties

misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to

personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of

correcting possible factual errors in the data.

</p>



<p>

If a Time Warner site discloses personally identifiable information

to companies not owned by Time Warner who want to market products or

services to you, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or

block such uses.  For instructions on how to opt out from such

disclosures, please <b><a href="http://turner.com/legal/3rdmrktng_legal.html">click here</a></b>. 

</p>



<p>

Time Warner may on occasion combine information we receive online

with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those

products or services that may be of interest to you.  If you prefer not

to receive marketing information from this site, <a href="http://turner.com/legal/howto_legal.html"><b>click here</b></a> for

instructions on how to make your request.</p>



<p>

Finally, Time Warner sites will not use or transfer personally

identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones

described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt

out of these unrelated uses.</p>



<b><p>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</p>

</b> 



<p>

Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information

practices may be different than ours.  Visitors should consult the other

sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is

submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>



<p>

Time Warner sites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or

promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third

parties.  By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain

personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to

participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion.  Time Warner has

no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information.  The

Time Warner site will notify you at the time of requesting personally

identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such

information.</p>

many of our web pages use “cookies.”  Cookies are text files

we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. 

Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other

information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. 

However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally

identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data

stored in the cookie.</p>

sites.  We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or

services.</p> <b> <p>Our Commitment to Security</p> </b> <p>We have put

in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to

safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security,

and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>
